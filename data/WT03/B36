ABB REORGANIZED TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE

Dr Richard J Slember, president, ABB Power Plant Operations (US),
headquartered in Stamford, Conn, announces several changes in the areas of
sales/marketing, nuclear systems, fossil systems, services, controls, and
R&D. These changes, made public over the last few weeks, are a major part
of Slember's plan to build a more closely knit organization--one that can
"get the synergy out of ABB" and better serve the customer.
   Slember, who joined ABB Asea Brown Boveri in November 1990, told Power
that he expects to make a few more announcements in the coming months as he
fine-tunes his organization; however, these will be primarily personnel
assignments and not involve structural changes to the organization.
   Unified sales force. Perhaps the most significant of Slember's recent
announcements is the appointment of Michael Bray to head a newly formed,
unified US sales force to serve all units of ABB Power Plant Operations
except the nuclear and services groups. The new organization is now ABB's
primary interface with electric utilities for boilers, steam and gas
turbines, environmental control equipment, and powerplant controls.
   It was created in response to feedback from utilities, which had
requested a more focused customer-service organization. Says Slember, "This
action brings together an unparalleled offering in meeting customer
requirements. ABB, with a single organization, can now meet the customer's
needs for the entire powerplant, from fuel feed to stack."
   The Power Plant Operations sales force will operate from five regional
offices, coordinated by Bray from ABB's Windsor (Conn) facility. Regional
vice presidents are Andrew Cook, East, based in Windsor; Michael Salerno,
Southwest, Atlanta; Steven Deabler, Southwest, Dallas; Vincent Pacello,
Central, Chicago. The western regional vice president, to be located in
California, is still unnamed.
   Nuclear. Dr Shelby Brewer is appointed chairman, ABB Combustion
Engineering Nuclear Power, with responsibility for strategic customers,
government relations, and long-term positioning of the company's nuclear
businesses. Brewer joined Combustion Engineering Inc in 1984 as vice
president of operations for the Nuclear Power Systems Div.
   In a related appointment, Peter S Van Nort is named president, ABB
Combustion Engineering Nuclear Power, responsible for the operations of ABB
Impell and the company's nuclear-power business units: systems, fuel
services, and associated staff. Van Nort has been with ABB for about a
year, serving in upper-management positions.
   Boilers. Frank Fagan is appointed senior manager of ABB's boiler
business. Fagan, with over 30 years of experience in fossil-fueled
steam-generation technology and most recently president of ABB Combustion
Engineering Services Inc, will concentrate on developing ABB's global
boiler strategies and on optimizing the implementation of those strategies
in the US marketplace.
   Services. David M Gray becomes president, ABB Combustion Engineering
Services, replacing Fagan (see above). Gray, with extensive executive and
operations experience in the boiler business--most recently as vice
president of fossil services--is responsible for all service-related work
on operating boilers, world-wide. These services include all of the parts
and components used to maintain, rehabilitate, and upgrade boilers; the
engineering and design work to support that effort; field engineering
services; and training, testing, and analysis services. Gray's group also
is involved in the construction of new boilers, precipitators, scrubbers,
and related powerplant equipment, and provides commissioning services for
new boilers.
   Gray told Power that he sees a large amount of clean-air-related service
work down the road, but that this activity has not yet started in earnest
because federal and state regulations governing powerplant emissions are
not "final." Today, the boiler-service business essentially is in a
no-growth period, with activity dominated by normal rehabilitation
andpressure-part work. Considerable effort also is going into planning with
customers to ensure a prompt response to regulatory requirements when
specific clean-air guidelines are announced. One change in the services
business as it was envisioned only a few years ago, according to Gray, is
that many utilities are now looking to shut down old boilers rather than to
extend their life--this to facilitate complying with expected clean-air
statutes.
   Controls. Edward H Verdery is appointed president of ABB's new Power
Plant Controls business unit, incorporating the following preexisting
company operations: fossil instrumentation and control operations from
ABB's old Power Automation, Fossil Systems, and Fossil Services units and
the powerplant training simulator and computer businesses of the Power
Automation and Nuclear groups.
   In making this organizational change, Slember notes "In the past, the
powerplant operator had to use a piecemeal approach for plant control,
using equipment from various vendors for each part of the plant--for
example, boilers, turbines, or environmental control. We now have greater
breadth of offering in plant control and can match the control system to
the equipment, to optimize plant performance." The objective of integrated
controls is to lower costs to the operator, increase plant availability,
and minimize pollutant emissions.
   R&D. Finally, in an effort to weave a technology network from Europe to
the US, Slember names Dr Gernot Gessinger vice president of research and
technology. In his newly created position, Gessinger, a 20-yr ABB veteran,
is responsible for the establishment of R&D programs for all ABB Power
Plant operation in the US.

IN AN UNDERTAKING AS COMPLEX AND COSTLY AS POWERPLANT DEVELOPMENT--WHERE
STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE DESIGN AND
OPERATION OF A PLANT--PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS MUST BE AMPLY PREPARED FOR
REGULATORY AND PUBLIC OVERSIGHT.

By:
Marie Leone

At least one industry expert, Peter Mason, Bechtel Corp, San Francisco,
Calif, suggests the simple old-fashioned matrix system. He says this
evaluation tool has been successfully tested with nuclear powerplants, and
can easily be adapted to other types of facilities. In a talk to the recent
ASME Joint Power Generation Conference, Mason pointed out that many
technical issues relating to power-project work originate as safety or
environmental licensing concerns, often tied to legislation. He cites as a
good example the nuclear industry's design review process which takes place
before and after project completion. Often sparked by internal or external
audits, inspections, reviews, and/or employee concerns, intervenor
allegations, or hearing contentions, such issues can potentially delay, or
in some extreme cases, terminate projects--as was the case with the
Shoreham nuclear plant in New York which was prohibited from operating
commercially after construction and testing were complete.
   Mason's proactive approach includes a review, resolution, and analysis
of the issues and their root cause. By identifying and listing issues and
setting up cause matrices, project planners and plant-design experts can
identify problems before they become unmanageable, says Mason, who cites
the following example: The matrix evaluation method is used to design and
build a new waste-to-energy plant. After the plant begins operation, a
public citizen's group raises safety concerns about the type of waste fuel
being used and the toxicity of the ash. Local environmental regulators
question the plant owners, who in turn, are able to use the matrix to round
up information and redirect the questions back to relevant technical
documentation. Asa result, a convenient record of consistent information is
supplied to support the plant owner's decisions and safety-design
strategies.
   The matrix approach is designed to prevent those involved in project
development from overreacting or being scarred off by problems that can be
solved, notes Mason, adding that the issue-resolution step must remain a
technical, not a legal or quality-assurance matter, and thus must start
with a strong technical basis. More importantly, the process provides a
history of potential problems and technical resolutions so there is a
reference file for new powerplants. Often, problems that management assumes
are new have actually occurred before and have been solved, but the
"corporate memory" fails, says Mason.

RECENT COURT RULINGS AND LAWSUITS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE WASTE-TO-ENERGY
(WTE) PLANTS, AS WELL AS COAL-FIRED FACILITIES, HAVE UNDERSCORED THE NEED
FOR DEFINITIVE REGULATION ON ASH FROM POWERPLANTS.

By:
Marie Leone

In a decision that may go before the US Supreme Court, a federal appeals
court has ruled that ash generated by municipal-solid-waste (MSW) burning
plants is subject to regulation as a hazardous waste (Subtitle C) under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The decision by the US Court
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reverses a lower court decision based on
a 1988 lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Washington,
DC, against the city of Chicago. The latest decision raises the possibility
of higher disposal costs for MSW facilities located in Wisconsin, Indiana,
and Illinois--the court's jurisdiction. However, industry observers say
that the decision will not have a significant impact because most ash
tested under the existing EPA procedures does not exceed the regulatory
threshold for hazardous wastes, reports Independent Power Report, a
McGraw-Hill Inc newsletter. But although this particular ruling may not
hurt the industry, the fact that no clear-cut rule exists leaves the door
open for future complications that could aggravate project development,
warn industry sources.
   For example, based on a 1980 EPA rule, Congress voted to exempt
"household waste" from RCRA's definition of hazardous waste. In an effort
to further clarify the exemption, Congress added a section to the law in
1984 stating that a waste-to-energy plant "shall not be deemed to be
treating, storing, disposing of, or otherwise managing hazardous wastes, so
long as the plant receives and burns only household waste or solid waste
from commercial or industrial sources that does not contain hazardous
wastes." Since then, industry experts have interpreted this to mean that if
the fuel-waste delivered to the plant is not hazardous, then it follows
that the ash coming out is non-hazardous as well, and should be categorized
under RCRA's Subtitle D. However, the recent Chicago ruling disallowed that
interpretation. Chief Judge William Bauer wrote in the majority opinion
that the "ash is fundamentally different in its chemical and physical
composition from the plastic, paper, and other rubbish that goes in."
   Regarding coal, the Oregon-based Citizens Interested in Bull Run Inc is
suing EPA to force a decision about whether to regulate coal-combustion
waste by electric-utility plants as hazardous or non-hazardous. Under the
1980 RCRA amendments, EPA was ordered to complete a report on
coal-combustion wastes and finalize a rule no later than six months after
the completion of the report. Although the report was completed in 1988,
EPA has yet to make a decision on the classification of coal ash. The
primary concern over disposal of the waste is the potential for leachate to
contaminate groundwater. Small quantities of arsenic, barium, cadmium,
lead, mercury, selenium, and other contaminants are known to be present in
coal ash.
   A decision to characterize coal-combustion wastes as hazardous will
significantly raise ash-disposal costs for coal-fired plants, say industry
observers. That becomes important when considering new generating capacity
and comparing the cost of coal-fired plants with other options. Note that
key members of Congress are pushing to amend RCRA sometime this year
(Power, December 1991, p 9).

DRAFT LEGISLATION AIMED AT SUBSIDIZING THE RENEWABLE-ENERGY INDUSTRY IS
DRAWING FIRE FROM INDUSTRY GROUPS.

By:
Marie Leone

The House proposal would establish a 2.5 cents/kWh incentive payment for a
total of 10 years for electricity produced from solar, wind, biomass, and
certain forms of geothermal energy. To pay for the incentive, Congress
would impose a user fee averaging one-third of a mill (one-thirtieth of a
cent) per kWh on electric generation. The fee would be capped at one-half
mill per kWh.
   The Edison Electric Institute, Washington DC, opposes the draft, saying
it is an energy tax that would skew the energy market. In addition, a
spokesman for the National Assn of Regulatory Utility Commissions (Naruc)
says Naruc will oppose the proposal, noting that although "we support
renewable energy, our traditional policy is to oppose energy fees or taxes
imposed by the federal government because in the end they are passed on to
the ratepayers."
   Conversely, representatives from the renewable energy industry maintain
that the proposal would firmly establish the US as a leader in renewable
energy technology and help renewables find a permanent place in the US
energy supply mix.

TECHNICAL PROFILES OF CURRENT PROJECTS AS REPORTED IN MCGRAW-HILL ENERGY
GROUP'S ELECTRIC UTILITY WEEK, INDEPENDENT POWER REPORT, AND NUCLEONICS
WEEK NEWSLETTERS

Utilities in the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) say peak
demand will increase by an average of 1.9%/yr through 1999. To meet this
growth, utilities plan to add 6631 MW of net operable capacity during the
decade. Figure includes new construction and reactivation of units now in
cold shutdown. The only utilities in the region planning more than 500 MW
of new construction are Arizona Public Service Co (535 MW), Los Angeles
Dept of Water & Power (506 MW), Nevada Power Co (710 MW), Sacramento
Municipal Utility District (550 MW), and San Diego Gas & Electric Co (698
MW). All of the new capacity would be gas-fired peaking or combined-cycle
units. The only base-load units in the forecast are the expected return to
service of Public Service Co of Colorado's Ft St. Vrain nuclear plant as a
gas-fired steam/electric unit in 1995 and Southern California Edison Co's
reactivation of the oil-fired, 320-MW Alamitos Unit 3 in 1996, oil-fired,
126-MW San Bernardino Units 1 and 2 in 1997, oil-fired, 132-MW Etiwanda
Unit 1 in 1998, gas-fired, 215-MW Huntington Beach Unit 3 in 1999, and the
gas-fired, 180-MW Highgrove Unit 3 in 1999. Non-utility generation (NUG)
additions in the region are expected to total 2655 in the 1991-1999
period. Utilities planning more than 200 MW of NUGs are Nevada Power (377
MW), Pacific Gas & Electric Co (498 MW), Public Service Colorado (628 MW),
Puget Sound Power & Light Co (296 MW), and Southern California Edison (514
MW). Major new-capacity additions by utilities in the WSCC region include
the following: Portland General Electric Co, a 210-MW combined-cycle plant
for operation in July 1998; Arizona Public Service, three 70-MW combustion
turbines in 1998, two more in 1999, and another in year 2000; LADWP, a
240-MW combined-cycle in 1994, plus unspecified additions of 100 MW in
1997, 1999, and 2000 and 200 MW in 1998; Nevada Power, combined-cycle
conversions of Clark Units 5 and 6 in 1993 and Units 7 and 8 in 1994, plus
70-MW combustion-turbine additions in 1994, 1995, and 1996; San Diego Gas
& Electric, 230-MW combined-cycles in 1995 and 1996 and 224-MW combined
cycles in 1998 and 2000; SMUD plans to add its 550 MW in 1996, but no
details are available. Houston Lighting & Power Co plans a 160-MW,
gas-fired cogeneration project at a DuPont Corp facility in LaPorte, Tex,
that would be owned by the utility as a traditional rate-based plant.
Commercial operation of the $120-million (not including land, switchyard,
and transmission expenses) facility is expected in mid 1995 . . . Black
Hills Power & Light Co asks the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council to waive
a permit application for its proposed 80-MW, coal-fired Simpson Unit 2 so
the utility can begin construction by August 1993 . . . Thermo Electron
Corp, Energy Systems Div, Waltham, Mass, selects United Engineers &
Constructors Inc to design a 21-MW, biomass-fired powerplant in Delano,
Calif. A fluidized-bed boiler will be installed. Construction start is
expected in the spring of 1992; project completion by the end of 1993 . . .
US Windpower Inc, Livermore, Calif, and InterCoast Energy Co, a unit of
Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric Co, form a joint venture--WindRiver
Development Co, Davenport, Iowa--to develop at least 250 MW of
wind-generated capacity in the Midwest . . . Wheelabrator Environmental
Systems, Hampton, NH, joins Decker Energy International Inc, Winter Haven,
Fla, as a partner in a 40-MW woodwaste- and waste-tire-fired project in
Polk County, Fla, near Lakeland. Schedule calls for a January 1994
startup, but state and federal air permits have not yet been obtained . . .
Southern Electric International Inc, Atlanta, Ga, considers
co-developing a $20-million office-paper recycling plant with DeNovo Corp,
Washington, DC, that would use 60,000 lb/hr of steam from SEI's planned
220-MW, pulverized-coal-fired cogeneration project near Fredricksburg, Va.
The powerplant project was selected by Virginia Power in its 1989
solicitation under the assumption that a steam host could be developed . . .
General Electric Co, Schenectady, NY, estimates that about 69,000 MW of
NUG capacity will be ordered in the US between 1991 and year 2000, with
the Southeast the most significant market region in the 1990s. Estimate is
higher than those of others because the GE number is for plant orders
rather than completed facilities . . . East Kentucky Power Cooperative Inc
selects its own bid for 300 MW of gas-fired peaking capacity, needed by
mid-1995, over those from 11 private developers. The utility based 60% of
the bid scoring on price, remainder on non-price criteria such as
reliability and environmental issues. . . Texas Utilities Electric Co's
"information request" soliciting cogenerators and independent power
producers for expressions of interest for long-term, firm generating
capacity--the utility plans to add nearly 2200 MW by the end of the
decade--brings replies from 48 developers. The 102 projects proposed
included 83 gas- and 12 coal-fired facilities . . . The village of Green
Island, NY, selects American Ref-Fuel, Houston, Tex, to build a
$250-million, 1500-ton/day waste-to-energy plant . . . Pinellas County,
Fla, which operates a 3150-ton/day waste-to-energy plant shelves plans to
expand facility throughput by as much as 50% because actual volumes have
fallen far below projections for several reasons, among them: drought and
related water restrictions, the economic downturn (less new construction,
fewer tourists, etc), little or no population growth, recycling of waste .
 . . Wisconsin Electric Power Co plans to build a 160-MW cogen plant at the
largest paper mill in the state--Repap Wisconsin Inc's Kimberly facility .
 . . KVA Resources Inc, Bellevue, Wash, agrees to joint-venture with
Columbia Aluminum to build a 210-MW, gas-fired combined-cycle plant near
the John Day dam on the Columbia River that would intertie at a substation
at the smelter. If permitting proceeds according to plan, the plant could
be in operation as early as September 1993 . . . Towner Electric LP,
Minneapolis, Minn, and an unnamed utility plan to develop a 440-MW,
coal-gasification project in New Jersey that would also produce 25-million
gal/yr of methanol for use as a gasoline additive or as an alternative to
motor fuel for areas--like New Jersey--where ozone levels must be lowered
to comply with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Power would be sold
to Public Service Electric & Gas Co under an agreement specifying that an
80% capacity factor be maintained by the new project or it would be
responsible for the cost of replacement power . . . Tennessee Valley
Authority expects to add up to 220 MW of hydroelectric capacity over the
next 10 years by investing an estimated $100-million in a retrofit program
to upgrade turbine runners. First contract in the program, for replacement
runners at Wilson and Chicamauga dams, was awarded last October to Voith
Hydro Inc, York, Pa . . . Montana Power Co's 150-MW solicitation for
deliveries beginning in 1996 attracts notices of intent to bid for 170
projects totaling about 13,500 MW . . . Plans to develop two cogeneration
and two geothermal projects totaling more than 110 MW are announced in
Oregon, including: James River Corp's (Westport) 50-MW, woodwaste-fired
powerplant that would power the expansion of the company's paper mill,
Eugene Water & Electric Bd/California Energy's 30-MW geothermal plant in
Newberry Crater, Vulcan Power Co's 30-MW geothermal plant in Newberry

COAL HANDLING AND PREPARATION
Although the basics remain the same, the many elements comprising coal
handling and preparation in the powerplant have taken on a new luster--put
there by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

By:
Thomas C Elliott, Senior Editor

Coal cleaning at the mine, transportation to the powerplant, site
unloading, stockout and storage, reclaiming, feeders and conveyors,
preparation, blending and switching, overall instrumentation and
control--these are the key topics reviewed in this report. The underlying
theme is the pervasive impact of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(CAA), which has so altered the thinking about powerplant operation in the
years ahead (see Power Special Report, "Clean Air Act Amendments: The
Engineering Response," June 1991). Until these amendments became law,
precombustion technologies were merely a part of the landscape, advancing
mostly as the occasion demanded. Now they are at center stage, key players
in the struggle to slash powerplant emissions at the stack before they
become problems.
   Evidence of a renewed emphasis on precombustion technologies is
compelling (also see box, p 18). For example, the idea of constructing a
common coal-preparation plant serving several large power stations is being
discussed today as a business venture similar to independent power
production. In addition, at least one midwestern utility reportedly is
investigating the construction of a centrally located coal-blending station
serving many of the utilities affected by CAA.

COAL CLEANING
   About one-third of US steam coal (over 200-million tons) is cleaned to
remove ash and sulfur impurities and to increase the coal's heating value.
Most of the costs of coal cleaning are borne by mining companies, who build
and operate the cleaning facilities and dispose of the refuse removed from
the coal in the cleaning process (Figure 1). The mining companies pass some
of these expenses along to powerplants in higher coal prices.

Clean-coal benefits
Utilities are burning more cleaned coal each year because they find that
the savings it offers in fuel handling, plant efficiency, availability, and
environmental controls compensate for the added cost. More specifically,
improved coal quality can result in:
   --A reduction of up to 20% in transportation costs.
   --Reduced pulverizer operation and maintenance (O&M) costs because there
will be less hard mineral matter to pulverize.
   --Increased boiler availability, efficiency, and life expectancy because
of reduced slagging, fouling, corrosion, and erosion.
   --Reduced electrostatic-precipitator or fabric-filter O&M costs because
there will be less particulate matter to capture.
   With the tighter controls on SO subscript 2 emissions mandated by the
CAA, it will be interesting to see in which direction utilities lean with
regard to the precombustion alternatives of coal cleaning, blending, and
purchasing of low-sulfur coals. Since the latter two are generally less
expensive, the scales may tip toward them. Even now, low-sulfur western
coals are becoming increasingly attractive compared to flue-gas
desulfurization.

Commercial techniques
   Basic coal-cleaning techniques are covered in detail in McGraw-Hill
Inc's Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering, "Coal Cleaning," Sec 4,
Pt 1, Ch 2, and in Power's Special Report, Coal cleaning, September 1981;
also, March 1987, p 76, and August 1990, p 77. However, two leading-edge
commercial techniques worth mentioning are these:
   --Improved hydraulic jig effectively cleans fine coal--a growing
challenge as new mining methods produce finer coal particles for greater
sulfur liberation. This fine-coal jig uses hydraulic separation to stratify
a bed of different-density particles through the application of a pulsating
water stream. Microprocessor-controlled air valves regulate the length of
pulsation strokes, allowing raw-coal cleaning down to 100 microns.
   --Conventional heavy-media coal-cleaning process has been refined in
this fashion: (1) A new type of magnetite is used with optimized physical
and mechanical properties, (2) the cyclone separation step is enhanced, and
(3) the recovery of magnetite has been significantly improved. These
process refinements pertain to the fines cleaning circuit only; the
coarse-material circuit is the same as a conventional prep plant.
   Processes nearing commercial status are the thermal drying of low-rank
coals, principally low-sulfur western coals, and the production of pellets
from these dried coals, which typically crumble and become very dusty. In
both cases, the objective is to reduce transportation costs and make the
coal more attractive to eastern markets.

Advanced techniques
   Some advanced techniques are these, which are at the bench-scale, pilot,
or demonstration stages:
   --Agglomeration. Here, a light hydrocarbon--such as heptane--is
introduced to agglomerate spherical coal particles. Wet, raw coal is ground
to 20 mesh, is mixed vigorously with heptane in a high-shear contactor,
then enters a low-shear mixer where asphalt is added as a binder. After
agitation, the agglomerates are drained of water and refuse particles. At
this point, steam sparging captures the heptane for reuse. Finally, the
resulting coal pellets are water-washed to remove any trace of impurities.
   --Froth flotation. This is a physical/chemical process that depends on
the attachment of air bubbles to high-carbon-content hydrophobic solids.
Separation of coal occurs as dispersed air bubbles pass through a
suspension of fine raw-coal concentrate. Additives are usually required to
enhance the hydrophobic character of the coal particles relative to the
hydrophilic nature of the mineral matter.
   --Column flotation. This process takes advantage of the differences in
surface chemistries of coal and mineral matter, which affect the way these
particles interact with water and air bubbles. The fine-refuse slurry is
introduced into an 8-ft-diameter, 22-ft-high column. Air bubbles rising
from the column's bottom help to separate coal particles from waste
material and carry them to the top of the column, where they are skimmed
off.
   --Chemical process. Here, mine-cleaned coal is treated with sodium
hydroxide and potassium hydroxide to transfer organic and pyritic sulfur
and mineral matter into the molten alkali. Because of the high density of
the caustic melt, the clean coal floats to the surface of the reactor and
is separated out. Molten caustic is recycled; the cleaned coal is further
washed with water and dilute acid.
   --Biological process. Still in the embryonic state, bioprocessing
involves the use of micro-organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, to
catalyze sulfur-removal reactions. Studies show that 99% of pyritic sulfur
can be removed by the micro-organism thiobacillus ferroxidans. Especially
attractive is the use of bioprocessing for the removal of organically bound
sulfur, which is resistant to conventional coal cleaning; in the US,
research centers around removal using model compounds (dibenzothiophene,
polysulfides, and humic acids) to determine the mechanism of direct
cleavage of sulfur from coal. High cost may be an obstacle to selecting
this process.

TRANSPORTATION

Transportation from mine to powerplant is via unit train, barge, truck,
overland conveyor belt, or any combination of these modes. The system
selected depends on such factors as distance from mine to plant, daily
"burn rate," location of plant site, and relative economics of competing
transportation modes.

Unit trains
   More than half of the nation's coal-fired steam generators are fed by
unit-train coal delivery (Figure 2). A typical coal train is comprised of
about 110 cars, with each car carrying about 100 tons of coal--an
11,000-ton-capacity train continuously operating back and forth between
coal source and plant like a shuttle. Many utilities own their unit trains
outright, with these benefits: reduced freight rates, better railcar
availability, greater degree of control over scheduling and maintenance.
   Of interest today are shipments of low-sulfur coal from the Powder River
Basin in Wyoming to eastern destinations. Because of CAA, this coal (at
roughly $4/ton) is becoming increasingly attractive. Fears that shortages
and bottlenecks in moving this coal eastward in the years ahead, spurred by
burgeoning demand, appear to be groundless.
   These questions most often arise: Will shipment costs rise precipitously
in a demand economy? Will there be enough railcars to handle the rising
load? Will there be enough trackage? Will scheduling be a problem? The
answers are encouraging.
   Railroad management is not about to take advantage of its good
customers, especially since coal suppliers/users form a solid base for its
overall business (annual tonnages are more than three times greater than
the second largest commodity, farm products). Although costs may rise, they
will reflect competitive conditions and not those of a captive marketplace.
While it is true that railcar manufacture annually is considerably less
than 15 years ago (100,000 cars plus vs 40,000 or so today), most cars can
accommodate more coal and weigh less (being aluminum-bodied), thus can
carry an extra five to 10 tons of coal without exceeding track weight
limitations. New routes shouldn't be necessary, although reinforcements in
selected areas, upgrading of some trackage, extended siding lengths, and
double trackage may be required. Most important, railroads generally are
run better--they operate faster, more efficiently, with better scheduling.
   With regard to freeze control, thaw sheds at the plant site are still
the most common solution to arriving shipments of frozen coal, although the
high operating costs associated with these systems restrict their use to
the largest utilities. Friable western coals are more prone to hard
freezeups because of their high fines concentrations.
   Freeze-conditioning agents (FCAs) are receiving increased attention
because of their effectiveness in many applications. Some act as an
anti-freeze while others weaken the crystalline structure of ice. A
recently introduced FCA consists of50% glycol with special wetting agents
for freeze conditioning during rail transport. A recent field study
suggests that treating the sides of a coal car with FCAs could be more
effective than treating the coal itself.

Barges
   Where feasible, barge delivery usually offers the lowest cost per
ton-mile, whether for coal or other bulk materials. As a result, US inland
waterways have been extensively developed, with most coal traffic on the
Ohio, Monogahela, Mississippi, and Tennessee rivers. A typical barge for
coal transportation is an open hopper vessel measuring 195 ft long, 35 ft
wide, 12 ft deep, and loaded to about 1500 tons at an 8- to 10-ft draft.
Typically, 15 barges are ganged together, pushed by a tugboat, in an
arrangement called a "unit tow," which carries 22,500 tons of coal.
   While inexpensive, barge transportation is slow-moving, which can
complicate scheduling. Waterway freezeups during winter months can be a
problem, as can drought conditions when they become severe enough to
threaten water levels. The crippling drought in the Midwest in 1990 is a
good example.
   With the anticipated surge in coal traffic--expected to reach more than
180-million tons by the mid-1990s--a need exists now for larger fleets,
bigger-capacity barges, and continued maintenance and construction
improvements on the inland waterway system.

Trucks, overland conveyors
   These modes of transportation are used primarily for coal deliveries to
plants near coal mines, although coal for small industrial boilers are
often supplied by trucks covering greater distances. Overland conveyors
commonly move coal up to 15 miles from mine to plant, or from mine to
storage or transportation facilities. Longer distances are feasible but may
not be economical compared to truck hauls or short-haul rail transport.
Aerial tramways are sometimes used instead of conveyors to cover relatively
short distances.
   Deliveries by truck account for about 13% of the total amount of coal
shipped annually. Three-axle dump trucks hold about 20 tons of coal,
tractor/trailers up to 35 tons. The maximum load a truck can carry on
highways is limited by state regulations. Trucks sometimes see service for
hauling coal on the spot market; that is, when plants are able to buy
relatively small amounts of desirable coal from distant suppliers.
Normally, however, they cannot compete against rail or barge
transportation.

SITE UNLOADING

Once the coal shipment reaches the unloading area at the plant, equipment
tailored for this function comes into play.

Railcar unloading
   Here, the unloading system is designed to accommodate the specific type
of hopper car that delivers the coal: (1) conventional bottom-dump hopper
car with multiple doors, (2) rapid-discharge bottom-dump type where
virtually the entire car bottom is opened for quick unloading, and (3) a
top-dump gondola car that is unloaded by a rotary-car dumper (Figure 3).
   The first design is intended for small users. Designs two and three are
intended for larger coal-fired powerplants that require unit-train
delivery. Unloading with the rapid-discharge bottom-dump type is usually
performed while the train is in motion. When cars pass over the unloading
area (a long underground hopper or an elevated trestle), car doors are
automatically opened and closed. Speed is the advantage here; a 110-car
unit train can be dumped in 40 minutes--an unloading rate of 16,500
tons/hr. This can be attractive for short hauls (less than roughly 500
miles).
   At most utilities, rotary dumping is the preferred unloading method,
mainly because it offers better control of fugitive-dust emissions--always
a problem with low-sulfur coals. Major components of a rotary-car dumper
include the large circular end rings that support the rails on which the
dumper turns, and the platen, which carries the track rail. Each end ring
rotates on a set of trunions consisting of four or eight crane wheels. The
dumper is rotated by a gear reduction drive through a rack-and-pinion
arrangement or a chain. The unloading rate is typically 3500 tons/hr.
   Ironically, when hauling low-sulfur western coals, unloading equipment
is subject to little, if any, redesign. This is because train speeds and
sizes remain essentially the same. A rotary-car dumper, for example,
unloads whatever kind of coal arrives at the unloading area. A larger
shipment of western coal may take a little longer, but dumper retrofit
isn't necessary.

Barge unloading
   Primary types of barge unloaders are: (1) clamshell-bucket type, in
which a bucket is suspended from a set of hoisting cables and opened/closed
by a set of control cables; and (2) the bucket-ladder type, in which a
series of buckets are supported between two strands of roller chain running
in a loop. In the latter, the buckets are filled by being dragged through
the coal in the barge and emptied as they pass over a discharge sprocket
(Figure 4).
   Since significant barging of low-sulfur western coals is not
anticipated, unloading is not affected. Bucket redesign might be necessary
if western coals were to be barged, however, to accommodate the dustier,
subbituminous material. Low-sulfur eastern coals pose no special
challenge.
   Another type of unloader, called the Siwertell screw-type unloader, is
attractive at sites where noise and dust levels can be a problem. Rated at
1000 tons/hr, it consists of three totally enclosed screw conveyors, which
transfer the coal from collier to belt conveyor quietly and dust-free. If
barging of dusty low-sulfur coal increased, this unloader should be
considered.

STOCKOUT, STORAGE

The unloading and stockpiling of coal--both active and reserve--are closely
related, since the continuous unloading operations require the simultaneous
withdrawal and conveying of coal from the unloading point to the plant
storage areas. Conveying rates of coal to storage must correspond with the
maximum unloading rates, so that both operations can be carried out as a
single, continuous process.

Stockout equipment
   Stockout equipment includes a fixed-boom conveyor, radial stacker, or
stacker/reclaimer for, in most cases, stockpiling coal outdoors on the
ground. A fixed-boom conveyor is a stationary inclined conveyor with the
end cantilevered to allow the formation of a conical pile beneath the
conveyor discharge. Similar to this is a radial stacker, except the
conveyor can rotate horizontally in a semicircle to form a kidney-shaped
pile. Linear stackers and stacker/reclaimers (Figure 5) are rail-mounted
machines served by a conveyor that feeds coal to the machine (stockout) or
traveling tripper that delivers coal to the machine (reclaim).

Storage piles
   Active coal storage is the reclaiming of coal for combustion that has
been stored for a relatively short period of time, usually one week or less
(Figure 6). Coal from an active pile is normally reclaimed without
resorting to mobile equipment. The amount of coal stored in an active
coal-storage pile is usually a three-day supply at maximum burn rate.
   Reserve storage is a long-term storage pile for supplying coal to the
powerplant on an emergency basis in the event of an interruption of coal
shipments. Capacity of the reserve pile is a minimum 60-day supply at 75%
of the maximum burn rate. Coal in the reserve pile is compacted. Because of
its dusty qualities, low-sulfur coal requires special treatment in both
active and reserve storage. It must be wetted down or sprayed with
chemicals to prevent undue losses from fugitive-dust emissions. Also, FCAs
have been formulated for stockpiled coal applications.

Enclosed storage
   Enclosed storage of the active pile includes silos and storage barns.
The storage silo encloses a vertical concrete-cylinder coal-pile
configuration usually 70 ft in diameter (Figure 6). The pile is formed
within the silo by means of an overhead conveyor discharging at the center
of the silo. Reclaiming is via a belt conveyor--normally loaded by
vibrating feeders--at the silo's bottom.
   An inverted-V-shaped storage barn encloses a long, straight coal pile.
The pile is formed within the barn by means of an overhead conveyor with a
traveling tripper or a reversible shuttle conveyor. A belt conveyor in a
concrete tunnel below the coal pile does the reclaiming. It emerges from
below-ground outside of the storage barn and conveys the reclaimed coal to
the desired location.
   In the foregoing stackout/storage activities, handling of low-sulfur
coal will require some equipment redesign. Equipment must be larger to
handle the larger quantities of low-sulfur coal, and must also be speeded
up.

COAL RECLAIMING

In general, coal reclaiming systems may be classified as either below- or
above- grade, depending on whether the coal is removed from the bottom or
top of the storage pile. The tunnel conveyor is the principal form of
below-grade reclaiming and is paired with a variety of feed
systems--vibrating feeders, pile discharges, rotary-plow feeders, and
mobile equipment.
   Above-grade reclaiming systems include the bucket-wheel
stacker/reclaimer and bridge-mounted bucket-wheel reclaimers--the latter
used almost exclusively for bed-blending operations. As shown in Figure 5,
the main components of a stacker/reclaimer are the stacking/reclaiming boom
on which is a reversible-belt conveyor, boom counterweight, bucket wheel,
traveling rail-gantry mechanism with track wheels, and the traveling
tripper. The bucket wheel removes coal off an active storage pile and
discharges it onto the boom conveyor belt. It has a series of buckets
arranged around the circumference of the wheel. The buckets are
scoop-shaped with two open faces--one at the leading edge, for digging; the
other where the bucket is attached to the wheel, for discharge to the boom
conveyor.

COAL CRUSHING, STORAGE

In general, the average size of coal received at large powerplants is
3-in. x 0. The size required by pulverizers feeding large pulverized-coal
(p-c) boilers is 1 1/4-in. x 0. Thus, reclaimed coal must be reduced in
size by crushing before it is transported to the unit silos (Figure 7).
   The crusher most commonly selected to reduce 3-in. x 0 coal to 1 1/4-in.
x 0 coal is the ring granulator.It consists of two end plates mounted on
opposite ends of a drive shaft. Smaller shafts are mounted between these
plates around their periphery. On these shafts are small round cutting
rings that perform the crushing or grinding action. This assembly is
mounted in a steel housing, the bottom of which is a curved grate. As they
rotate, the rings force coal through the grates in the bottom. Grate
spacing is adjustable to compensate for wear.

Bunkers, silos
   After crushing, the coal is conveyed directly to the unit to fill the
bunkers or silos. The bunkers are large-capacity, rectangular-shaped bins
with multiple hopper-type outlets. Because coal tends to hang up on the
slopes and hopper valleys of bunkers, cylindrical concrete or steel silos
with conical outlets are an alternative. The capacity of in-plant silos is
usually 8-10 hours at maximum burn rate (all silos in the plant).
   Although bunkers have a greater capacity, a steady gravitation toward
silos at larger powerplants has occurred in recent years. Key reason: Less
potential for fires and explosions, especially for the low-rank coals
frequently selected today. Steeper bottom-discharge angles in the silo
chutes are being specified to make up for the increased use of poor-flowing
low-rank coals.
   Methods to feed coal bunkers or silos include fixed trippers, traveling
trippers, shuttle conveyors, reversible conveyors, and en-mass chain
conveyors. A primary concern for carbon steel silos and bunkers is metal
loss caused by corrosion and wear. Fortunately, carbon steel can be
protected with a gunite lining.

FEEDERS, CONVEYORS

Feeders deliver coal from a storage area to a point where a conveyor can
handle it conveniently for transport. Of the several different types
(apron, bar-flight, vibrating, etc), the gravimetric feeder is the most
sophisticated. It weighs material on a length of belt defined by two fixed
rollers (span) precisely located in the feeder body (Figure 8). A third
roller supports half the weight on the span. As material passes over the
span, the load cell generates a signal proportional to the weight supported
by the center roller. A microprocessor takes samples of the amplified
outputs of each cell. The samples are converted into binary numbers, which
are compared to parameters stored in memory. If the outputs are within
expected range, each is converted into a signal equivalent to weight per
unit of belt length, then added to obtain total weight per unit of belt
length.
   Friable western coals require special consideration in conveyor-system
design (Figure 9). Field experience has shown that the equipment sized to
handle a given quantity of eastern coal will not handle equivalent
quantities of western coal, even though speed adjustments are made to
compensate for the lower density of these fuels. The reason is that the
higher speeds necessary to provide an equivalent heat-rate input to the
boiler may create a significant fugitive-dust problem when conveying
western coals. Speeds in excess of 550 ft/min are not recommended because
of the high shear velocity along the coal's boundary layer, which has a
wind-blown effect on fines. Athough expensive, enclosed conveyors are a
solution.

COAL PREPARATION

In p-c firing, coal preparation consists of reducing the incoming stream of
coal to powder in a pulverizer (Figure 10), so that it will burn more
efficiently. Key pulverizing methods are these, which differ on the basis
of their drying, feeding, and transport characteristics (also see box, p
28):
   --Storage or bin-and-feeder. Coal is pulverized and conveyed by air or
gas to a collector, where the carrying medium is separated and coal is
transferred to a storage bin and then fed to the furnace, as required.
   --Direct-fired. The most common arrangement for new units, coal is
pulverized and transported with air (or air-diluted gas) directly to the
furnace. The hot air used is called primary air (PA), which is a portion of
the combustion air.
   --Semi-direct. Coal is pulverized and transported to a cyclone
separator, then the separated coal is supplied directly to the furnace by
the independent PA system.

Pulverizer types
   Basic principals of particle-size reduction with pulverizers (or mills)
are impact, attrition, and/or crushing; speed classifications are low,
medium, and high. Most commonly used pulverizers are the ball-tube,
ring-roll or ball-race, impact or hammer mill, and attrition types. The
first two types are most often selected for coal preparation in
powerplants, although ball-tube mills are not suitable for intermittent
operation and tend to be noisy, requiring noise attenuation.
   With ring-roll or ball-race mills, two general classes are these: (1)
the roller assembly is driven and the ring is stationary, or (2) the roller
assembly is fixed and the ring rotates. Generally, mills are equipped with
self-contained or integral classifiers to regulate the fineness. Exhausters
or PA fans are used for flow of hot air through the mills.

Recent advances
   A new series of coal mills reportedly reduces maintenance cost and
downtime. Features are an independent removable planetary gearbox,
vane-wheel primary classifier, heavy-duty grinding-roller assembly,
grinding-roller tilt-out mechanism, long-wear-life grinding elements,
spring cartridge assembly, and tall top classifier.
   A promising device for fine grinding of coal is a ball mill that grinds
coal from a nominally 3/16-in. topsize to a 10- to 20-micron size range in
a single stage using coarse grinding media. Key features: vertically
oriented, batch operated, intermediate-energy density, stirred bed. The
mill can lead to more efficient operation; also anticipated: reduced cost
of $29/ton vs $51/ton for conventional grinding under comparable
conditions.
   Coal-mill retrofits based on the principles of two-phase flow instead of
the usual air-only approximation are now possible. A computer model, using
fluid-mechanical calculations and physical interpretations of the
interactions between solid particles and a gas, help to identify a region
in the classifier with unstable flow characteristics and recommend hardware
changes that stabilize it. End result: Improved performance of the
p-c-fired boiler.
   A new, low-cost dry-cleaning process for removing pyrites from coal can
be integrated directly into a p-c powerplant, interfacing with existing
coal bunkers, mills, and burners. It uses a room-temperature, fluidized-bed
particle separator to perform the coal purification process.

What about FBC?
   Several large bubbling and circulating fluidized-bed boilers are
operating at utility powerplants. The need for carefully characterizing and
preparing coal for FBC application has only been recognized in the last few
years. It is not unusual to see sizing specifications of 1/16 in. or less
for low-volatile high-ash coals and coal wastes. High moisture content
aggravates existing prep problems. Top size for highly volatile coals may
still be rather liberal, however. To handle moisture-laden coal, extensive
coal blending is one solution. Fuel dryers can also be considered to
alleviate pluggage and combustor instability problems that result when
wetter-than-anticipated coal is fired.

BLENDING, SWITCHING

Coal blending can be achieved at either the mine or at the utility. At the
mine, it is mainly a matter of mixing higher-quality coals with those less
desirable to produce a blend attractive for purchase. At the utility, the
task is more formidable. Typically, coals are received by train or barge
and stocked in separate piles, by type, using an overhead tripper system. A
coal analyzer is installed downstream of the blending point. Each minute,
the analyzer assesses whether or not the mixture is on target; deviations
can quickly be corrected by making an adjustment in the feed rates from the
various stockpiles. The fuel is then blended by rotary-plow feeders below
each coal pile, which places pre-determined amounts of each type of coal on
the same conveyor belts--layered in a reasonably blended mix. Thus, coals
of various qualities from different mines can be combined for subsequent
combustion in a boiler.

Key advantages
   Blending offers these advantages:
   --Yields a uniform fuel possessing better combustion properties than the
individual coals making up the blend.
   --Allows western coals to be burned in boilers that would otherwise be
unable to fire subbituminous coals efficiently.
   --Either alone or with physical coal cleaning, can be a valuable method
for controlling the mineral content of coal.
   --Most important of all, by combining low- and high-sulfur coals, it
helps powerplants meet the new SO subscript 2 emissions limits.
   Blending is just as much a software as a hardware challenge. Coal
suppliers and powerplants can use commercially available software to select
coal sources for blending purposes, evaluate the effects of blending on
overall product quality, determine the amount of each coal type needed to
meet product specifications (sulfur, ash, heating value, etc), and design
the least-cost blend.

Fuel switching
   Switching from high-sulfur coal to a low-sulfur fuel, such as gas, oil,
or coal, represents a key option when developing a compliance strategy to
meet the new SO subscript 2 emissions limits. Remember, however, large
coal-fired utility boilers in service today have been custom-designed for
selected fuels; changing the fuel may have significant impact on the
operation and reliability of not only the boiler but also many of the
auxiliary systems.
   Assuming that the original fuel source is an eastern or midwestern
high-sulfur bituminous coal, fuel-switching alternatives are these: natural
gas, low-sulfur oil, co-firing (usually with gas), low-sulfur coal (either
western or central Appalachian), coal blending. Since the CAA is quite
flexible in how utilities meet emissions limits, the options for fuel
switching are many and diverse among the units and plants in the utility's
system.

PRECOMBUSTION I&C

Instrumentation and control of coal-fired powerplants is becoming
increasingly critical: Emissions limitations, better heat rates, and life
management have imposed this new challenge (see box, p 18). Plantwide
networks for weighing, sampling, and analyzing coal as it flows from mine
to boiler are an integral part of precombustion I&C.

Plantwide networks
   To move data between field devices and control/monitoring systems
requires a hierarchy like this (Figure 11):
   --Field bus to transmit data from field device to control system and
then transmit commands from control system to final control element.
   --High-speed data highway as a means of communications between control
and monitoring subsystems, and control-room interface with the operator.
   --Plant network to extract information from the data highway and
transmit it to management, operational support, and data-archiving
subsystems.
   --Communications gateways to interface between the plant information
network and systems outside the plant proper, such as the utility's energy-
and environmental-management systems, corporate computer network, etc.

Weighing, sampling
   Coal is weighed between bunker and boiler by a scale or feeder. In
stoker firing, scales are used exclusively; in p-c firing, either may be
selected. Typically, coal scales handle between 10 and 40 tons/hr, while
feeders process up to about 100 tons/hr. The gravimetric feeder (see above)
is among the most accurate weighing mechanisms. Also see the modular belt
scale shown in Figure 12, which is controlled by a microcomputer.
   Of the many types of p-c sampling systems, most provide isokinetic
sampling of the full cross-section of the coal pipe between bunker and
feeder. One vendor offers a portable sampler comprising a manual rotatable
probe with collecting cyclone and control box, making it possible to solve
fireside problems caused by coal imbalance between burners and minimize NO
subscript x emissions--as well as to measure mill performance with
accuracy.

Coal analyzers
   Continuous on-line coal analyzers are broadly classified as moisture
meters, ash meters, and elemental analyzers. All of them subject the coal
to energy from the electromagnetic spectrum, then correlate the response to
measure or to infer the coal's constituents and properties. The instruments
differ in accuracy, energy source used to excite the sample, amount of
material that can be sampled, potential analyzer locations, frequency and
difficulty of calibration, and installation costs.
   Moisture meters incorporate infrared- or microwave-energy excitation and
capacitance- or conductance-based measurement techniques. Commercial
instruments generally rely on microwave attenuation or capacitance
measurement because of their higher accuracy. Moisture meters can generally
be mounted directly onto conveyor belts.
   Ash meters are based on gamma-energy excitation to determine the coal's
mean atomic number (Figure 13). Because ash constituents have much higher
atomic numbers than combustible constituents, determining the coal's mean
atomic number provides an indirect measure of the ash content. Depending on
coal properties and other variables, ash meters may or may not require a
sampling system as opposed to direct mounting on coal transport devices.
   Elemental analyzers have a higher degree of measurement capability. They
measure the content of sulfur, carbon, nitrogen, and many other elements
directly. Also, properties such as calorific value, ash fusion temperature,
and fouling and slagging indices can be inferred from the elemental
composition.
   Prompt gamma neutron activation (PGNA) is the heart of elemental
analysis (Figure 14). Coal passing through a chute is irradiated with
neutrons, which are captured by the various nuclei of the elements
comprising coal. The resulting gamma rays emitted by each nucleus are
unique to that nucleus.
   The rays are transformed into photons at the gamma-ray detector
assembly, then converted into electronic signals and processed to reveal
each element's contribution to the spectrum. Elemental analyzers require a
sampling system.
   Systems available commercially may incorporate one of more or the
instruments mentioned above. For example, an elemental analyzer can be
combined with an ash meter, or ash content can be inferred from the
analysis given by a single elemental analyzer. Slurry analyzers are
available to monitor the composition of coal/water mixtures. Most measure
only ash and solids content, but some under development also are capable of
measuring sulfur and iron content.

Coal quality--and NO subscript x
   Virtually all experts concede that, unlike sulfur, it is impractical to
remove nitrogen from coal. But recent investigations underscore the
influence of coal properties on NO subscript x emissions; more
specifically, how coal properties can be manipulated to reduce NO subscript
x formation. Thus, it is critical that the impact of any coal type or
preparation technique on NO subscript x emissions be thoroughly understood
before a change is made to reduce SO subscript 2 emissions.
   Already, it is clear that today's low-NO subscript x burners require
more precise operation if combustion efficiency, CO emissions, bottom-ash
quality, flame stabilization, and other factors are not to be compromised.
Coal properties are likely to influence operation profoundly.

Under investigation
   In light of the improved I&C required to meet the new emissions and
reporting requirements of the CAA, at least one instrument manufacturer is
seeking to provide some answers. Major elements of its exploratory program
include the application of continuous, real-time coal- and flue-gas
analysis equipment (along with advanced control algorithms run by a
minicomputer) that relate coal characteristics to flue-gas parameters. The
goal is to document how true on-line feedforward and feedback control
schemes can be implemented--showing how precombustion control can
contribute significantly to the lowering of flue-gas emissions from
powerplant stacks.
   To test an on-line continuous coal calorimeter from another
manufacturer, the selected PGNA instrument actually burned the coal and
measured heating value directly. Different bituminous coals were tested
from different mines. Sulfur content inthe coal was calculated by measuring
SO subscript 2 concentration in the exhaust gas. Moisture in the sample was
determined by drying the coal and measuring total moisture (as burned) with
an automatic moisture-measurement device.
   Ash content was measured by X-ray fluorescence while coal was moving on
the belt feeder. An on-board computer controlled calorimeter operation and
calculated all air- and coal-mass flows as well as coal sulfur, moisture,
ash, and heating value.
   Key application: determining the proper mix of high- and low-sulfur
coals in coal yards.

COMING: EXPERT SYSTEMS TO PREDICT IMPACT OF COAL QUALITY ON PLANT
OPERATION

With the continuing sophistication of software, expert systems to relate
coal quality to plant performance are becoming increasingly attractive. For
example, under the US Clean Coal Technology Program, DOE and EPRI are
funding development and demonstration of a computer software
program--called the Coal Quality Expert (CQE)--that will predict the impact
of coal quality on powerplant performance and cost, including emissions
control. Already underway, it's a $17.4-million project.
   Integrating more than 20 computer models into a single workstation, CQE
will predict the effects of a particular coal on each facet of power
generation--from mine to stack. To determine the most cost-effective coal
and the least-expensive system to control emissions for a given plant, it
will evaluate a range of options, including various coals (26 are currently
under investigation), available transportation methods, and alternative
emissions-control strategies.
   The expert system will include cost-estimating models for new and
retrofit coal-cleaning processes, power production equipment, and
emissions-control systems. Individual models will be made available as they
are developed. The first of these models, called the Acid Rain Advisor, is
ready for use; over 70 EPRI members have models.
   When CQE is complete in 1994, users will be able to develop the most
economical emissions-control strategies, identify fuel options based on
overall plant economics, and evaluate alternative powerplant engineering
designs.

MICRONIZED-COAL MILLS YIELD PRODUCT 10 TIMES FINER THAN PULVERIZED COAL

Micronized coal (MC) is normally any coal pulverized to a fineness of 80 to
90% less than 325 mesh (43 microns), with an average particle diameter of
15 to 20 microns. By grinding the coal some 10 times finer than
conventional pulverized coal, the effective particle surface area is
greatly increased. As a result, the combustion chemistry speeds up still
more, leading to a reaction that begins to act like a gas or oil flame.
   Because of this reaction, the MC mill's best application is with
existing oil/gas-fired plants. Modifications are minimal--mostly the
addition of the MC mill, coal-storage/handling and ash-cleanout equipment,
and new controls. Boiler-tube modifications aren't necessary. A recent
advance is the simultaneous micronization of limestone and coal in the same
mill, leading to a significant reduction in SO subscript 2 emissions
   Key mill designs are these:
   --Disc and hammer. The mill houses a vertical shaft, four rotating discs
each supporting impact hammers, and a radial fan. As coal, entering at the
top, descends to each disc level, coal-particle sizing is progressively
reduced. The fan creates a downdraft, discharging the micronized coal at
the bottom.
   --Centrifugal-pneumatic. There comminution sets up a turbulent flow of
large and small, fast and slow particles, which impact on each other,
causing attrition and fine pulverization. A centrifugal classifier assures
coal with an optimal particle-size distribution.
   --Fluid energy. In this mill, a hollow, elongated torus has a lower zone
for grinding, an upper for classifying. Fluid (air or steam) enters the
grinding chamber through nozzles at pressures to 250 psig. As the fluid
expands, it picks up speed, reaching supersonic velocities. Crushed coal
enters the grinding chamber, becomes entrained in the rapidly circulating
turbulent flow, and is pulverized by mutual impaction and attrition. The
classifier passes finer particles, sends larger particles back.

SUPPRESSANTS CONTROL DUST IN ALASKAN MINE

An Alaskan coal mine produces 1.5-million tons/yr of ultra-low-sulfur
subbituminous C coal for domestic and export markets. The coal is crushed
in two steps, and then dropped onto a 660-ft-long enclosed belt conveyor,
which moves it to a 7500-ton storage bin. To operate year-round in severe
conditions, the mine had to be innovative in all aspects of the operation,
including dust control.
   Dust is generated at the crushers, transfer points, and loadout. To
improve dust control at these places, a proven method is the use of
chemical dust suppressants that are either water- or hydrocarbon-based.
Chemicals are added to increase the wettability of the coal and to
agglomerate small airborne particles into larger particles.
   After considerable investigation by mine and vendor personnel, the
product selected had a combination of wetting, foaming, and residual agents
to provide highly effective dust suppression--not only at the treatment
point (just upstream of the primary crusher), but throughout the mine
facility.--Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialists Inc.

ON-LINE COAL ANALYZER INSURES SO SUBSCRIPT 2 COMPLIANCE

Newly mandated emissions standards led Ohio Power Co's Muskingum River
plant to blend coal from an existing AEP-owned mine with low-sulfur coal
purchased from an outside supplier. To blend the coals efficiently, an
on-line analyzer was selected to provide constant readings of the sulfur
level in the mine-supplied coal to the plant, helping the utility to avoid
"overblending" large quantities of low-sulfur coal.
   With the analyzer (photograph), the plant was able to comply with the
new emissions standards by purchasing only 7% low-sulfur coal annually
(percent of total) as opposed to an estimated 30% that would be needed
based on traditional statistical blending methods.--Gamma-Metrics.

BARGE UNLOADER MOVES COAL INLAND IN A HURRY

Company was selected to design/erect a barge-unloading and yard-handling
system for Baltimore Gas & Electric Co's Brandon Shores powerplant, where
run-of-mine coal arrives in open-top barges from transloading facilities in
Norfolk, Va. The 1700-ft-long dock accommodates three barges.
   A pivoting-arm continuous bucket unloader is capable of unloading a
7000-ton barge at the rate of 4000 tons/hr onto the 72-in. collecting
conveyor. This conveyor transports the 2 in. x 0 coal to conveyor No. 2,
sending it over the water and inland to transfer building No. 1, 2100 ft
away. The control-cab operator on the barge unloader can then direct the
stream to either conveyor No. 3, which conveys to the existing Wagner
station stockpile, or to main conveyor No. 4, which terminates at transfer
building No. 2.
   From transfer building No. 2, coal can be directed to the inactive
storage pile, or go on to the bucket-wheel stacker/reclaimer serving two
live storage piles.--Roberts & Schaefer Co.

VALVE ISOLATES BURNER/PULVERIZER LINE

The NFPA code states that every burner line must have at least one
isolating valve between pulverizer and burner for pulverized-coal firing.
At Dayton Power & Light Co's 2400-MW Stuart station, the valve is closed to
isolate the pipe from the furnace during maintenance of a pulverizer or a
leaking coal pipe. A leaking pipe can be repaired while the pulverizer
supplies the furnace with coal through the remaining pipes.
   Called a knife gate valve (photograph), it can withstand the
temperatures associated with burner lines (up to 1700F in some cases). The
tight-fitting valve comes in diameters from 4 to 18 in., and can be
manually operated or fitted with an actuator.--Stock Equipment Co.

FEEDERS PROVIDE CONTINUOUS, DEPENDABLE TRANSFER OF COAL

Vibrating feeders provide continuous and dependable transfer of coal from
storage to generating plant at rates up to 1500 tons/hr (photograph).
Ruggedly designed, many of them have been in service for more than 15
years.
   Coal from the storage facility is delivered via these vibrating feeders
at a fixed rate onto the main conveyor belt and into the powerplant. They
easily fit into existing systems where other types of feeders have failed
to perform.--Renold Inc.

FAMILY OF DUST SUPPRESSANTS BASED ON RESEARCH, TESTING

The Dust-Buster family of dust-suppressant products is the result of
extensive research and field testing under a range of actual conditions.
Products include surfactants, single-application foams for localized dust
suppression, and single-application foams for continued dust suppression
through downstream operations.
   Since each operation for mining and handling of coal is unique in its
methods and requirements, a comprehensive site survey is conducted to
identify problem areas and to determine specific dust-suppression needs.
Then the company considers where suppression is needed most and which
application technique will provide optimum suppression at lowest cost.
   Company provides a full-service program from equipment design,
installation, and service through on-site performance testing. Equipment is
installed during normal shutdown times, thereby eliminating costly delays.
Personnel remain until all systems are functioning properly.--Martin

RING HAMMERMILL OFFERS DIVERSE SERVICE

The ring hammermill is primarily a coal crusher, but it is not limited to
such service in powerplants. Its rugged construction makes the hammermill
adaptable to the reduction of coal middlings, lignite, gypsum, soft
limestone, chemicals, and other friable materials.
   To minimize wear and avoid generating excessive fines, the machine is
designed to operate at relatively low rotor speeds. Ring hammers provide
maximum wearing surface and eliminate the necessity of manually turning the
hammers. This feature, along with the adjustable cage, reduces maintenance
cost and ensures control of product size throughout the service life of the
crushing elements.
   The mill is available in sizes ranging from 20 up to 3000 tons/hr or
more, making it suitable for small industrial plants or the largest central
stations. If desired, the machine can be furnished with a built-in bypass,
which requires very little extra floor space, no extra headroom, and
practically no extra initial investment.--Allis Mineral Systems, Grinding

PAIR CRUSHER/DRYER WITH FLUIDIZED-BED COMBUSTORS FOR EFFICIENT FUEL
PREPARATION

At this California powerplant, a crusher/dryer is the heart of what is
reportedly the first fuel-preparation system to be integrated with
fluidized-bed combustors. Hot flue gas at a temperature of 1500 to 1700F is
drawn into the machine, where 23%-moisture fuel is simultaneously crushed
and dried to meet the requirements of Combustion Power Co's circulating
fluidized-bed (CFB) boiler at GWF Power Systems' 20-MW powerplant near
Hanford, Calif (schematic). CFB-boiler requirements are 228,000 parts/hr
fines.
   The system features the ability to produce a dry, free-flowing fuel
using the energy available from the combustors for drying, then
close-looping the exhaust gases back to the boiler with no loss in unit
efficiency, while also eliminating a dedicated fabric filter for the drying
process. Because of the low O2 content of the flue gas, crushing and drying
take place in an inert atmosphere. Equipment meets NFPA 69 and 85F
requirements.--Williams Patent Crusher & Pulverizer Co.

SAMPLING WITHIN BIAS-TEST ACCURACY LIMITS

At Ireland's Moneypoint generating station, Clean Sweep sampling systems
were selected to replace nonfunctioning, three-stage falling-stream
systems. The new systems are guaranteed to perform reliably, handling wet
coal without hangups and providing sampling results within specified
bias-test accuracy limits.
   The automated belt-sampling system has (1) a primary sampler, which
mounts on the conveyor truss or stringers; and (2) a secondary module,
which is at ground level alongside the conveyor. Crushed coal is sampled
from both stopped and moving belts. A "contoured support" assures correct
belt height, which also corrects for sags and valleys.
   At Moneypoint, all Clean Sweep systems are equipped with mechanical
intermediate sampling to recover uncrushed samples without stopping the
primary belt. Also, all systems have crushers capable of single-stage
reduction to 1/8 in. x 0 size. Commissioning was completed in October 1990.
The systems have been successfully bias-tested and in continuous service
since installation.

PULVERIZER UPGRADES BOOST PERFORMANCE

A Midwest utility experienced problems with its six 1975 coal pulverizers.
Mechanical failures led to frequent downtime, resulting in substantial loss
of unit availability. The company made an evaluation and installed six new
mills, one at a time (photograph), allowing the steam generator to remain
on line. Each pulverizer was subassembled into major sections, offering
quick installation. Pulverizerreliability and availability have improved
dramatically, while maintenance costs have plunged.
   In some retrofits, noncompany mills have been upgraded by re-using as
much as 30% of the existing components and installing company internals in
custom-engineered, modified housings. Improved performance, reduced capital
and maintenance costs were the result.--Babcock & Wilcox Co.

MILL EFFICIENTLY GRINDS WET OR DRY COAL FINES

This vertical-type mill can be a continuous or batch-type stirred-media
machine that can efficiently grind wet or dry coal fines. Grinding media
such as steel balls, ceramic or natural pebbles, or other material is
stirred by an overhung double-helix screw (or charge agitator) in an
open-circuit configuration. Material to be ground is fed in at the top
along with mill water. A continuous upward flow of slurry is maintained by
an external recycle pump. Small feed particles rise and large particles
fall to the media charge, where they are drawn into the media for
grinding.
   Media rises within the screw flights and falls downward in the annular
space between the flight tips and the inside diameters of the mill body.
With steel balls as media, typical media depth is 6 to 8 ft. During
operation, the lower portion of the mill body is packed with media except
for a small space directly below the screw flights. Pulp overflows from the
mill body into an integral classifier. The overflow is either product or
feed for subsequent classification. Underflow is recycled.--Allis Mineral
Systems, Grinding Div.

TWO-PASS RO EASES DEMINERALIZER REGENERATION BURDEN
Membrane applications to makeup-water treatment continue to expand. Redesign
of a utility pretreatment system, described here, introduced many
improvements, not least among which was a major reduction in chemical costs

By:
Compiled by Sheldon D Strauss


Ion-exchange (IX) demineralization is a common, effective method used for
supplying makeup water for steam production. As one utility learned,
however, system modification as a result of open-minded analysis can lead
to product improvement and reduction of operating cost.
   The utility is TU Electric, and the case in point is the Stryker Creek
generating station. As described at the recent International Water
Conference, the opportunity for improvement arose when deterioration of the
treatment system reached a point where reliability, maintenance costs, and
availability of replacement parts became a source of major concern. Several
other factors compounded the problem: limited availability and rising cost
of sodium hydroxide, and the impact of IX waste discharges on the
environment. The need for reduced silica input to the station's two
high-pressure boilers was another consideration.(Reference 1)
   These problems were resolved by substituting membrane treatment for the
cation/anion resin-bed combination used to pretreat makeup water for the
station's mixed-bed demineralizer. In almost a year of operation, it has
provided a better influent for polishing, reducing the frequency of
mixed-bed regeneration. Although the product flow is less, this has been
more than compensated for by an increase in the pretreatment duty cycle.
   The treatment system initially consisted of greensand filters,
strong-acid cation and strong-base anionIX units, and a mixed-resin bed; a
degasifier following the cation unit provided for CO subscript 2 removal.
Operating to a 100-micro-S/cm endpoint, the two-bed (cation/anion) section
provided water quality typically in the range 10 to 80 micro-S/cm. The
mixed bed was operated to an endpoint of 1 micro-S/cm or 10 ppb silica,
concentration of the latter ranging from 10 to 20 ppb SiO subscript 2
during service runs.
   Several options, all involving membrane treatment with reverse osmosis
(RO) in various configurations, were proposed when the need for improvement
became apparent. To process raw makeup with 400 mg/L dissolved solids,
several membrane types were considered, including "seawater" polyamide
membranes because of their 99.5% salt-rejection capability.(Reference 2)
Other choices were between single-pass and two-pass RO systems and possible
elimination of the cation/anion-bed combination as opposed to rebedding.
   Compared to a single-pass RO with two new cation/anion trains, a
single-train system with two RO passes offered advantages with respect to
both capital and operating costs; service runs of the mixed bed with a
single-pass seawater RO array, moreover, was not judged to be satisfactory.
The cost premium for using seawater elements in the first pass of a
two-pass unit was not justified, on the basis of salt passage relative to
brackish-water elements.
   These considerations led to the configuration of choice: A two-pass,
single-train RO featuring thin-film composite (TFC) polyamide membranes.
The dominant factor in this decision was the chemical consumption in
operating the original treatment system--over 462,000 lb of sulfuric acid
and 274,000 lb of sodium hydroxide in more than 600 regenerations of the
cation and anion beds each year. Substitution of the membrane units was
projected to reduce IX-bed regenerations by 98% overall.
   The new system retains greensand filtration and degasification in the
pretreatment section. New greensand media is used, and permanganate is
added continuously to reduce the iron content of the feed; sodium bisulfite
is fed downstream to remove residual free permanganate for protection of
the thin membranes from oxidation (Figure 1). Sulfuric acid injection
reduces influent pH to 4.5, converting the initial 130-ppm bicarbonate
alkalinity to CO subscript 2 for reduction (to about 10 ppm) by the
decarbonator. Subsequent pH elevation to 8.3 by caustic addition further
reduces CO subscript 2 pass-through and improves membrane rejection
capability.
   Cartridge filters provide 5-micron filtration of solids, followed by
injection of antiscalant/dispersant for additional protection of the
membrane system. Under a 500-psi pressure differential supplied by a
multistage centifugal pump, makeup flows in sequence to the two passes,
each of which comprises two stages. Each of the membrane pressure vessels
contains six FilmTec Corp (Minneapolis, Minn) type BW30-840 membrane
elements (Figure 2). Because the second-pass reject is of high quality, it
is returned to the first-pass feed stream. First-pass reject is normally
discharged, but held for neutralization if pH is excessive. The membrane
system has averaged 75% recovery.
   The system modification and quality improvement of treated makeup
account for 96% reduction in the cost of chemicals (over $2/1000 gal of
product water), more than offsetting the added cost to operate and maintain
the system membranes, pumps, membranes, filters, etc (about $1.7/1000 gal
to date, and projected at $1.3/1000 gal). Indicative of the water-quality
improvement is the 1.2-micro-S/cm conductivity and 3-ppb silica leakage
(average values) of the two-pass RO vs 30 micro-S and 15 ppb, respectively,
for the two-bed ion exchangers.
   Resulting improvement of the final product has been the reduction of
conductivity from 0.5 to 0.08 micro-S/cm and silica from 5-10 ppb down to
bare detectability. As added benefits, the modification has obviated the
need for new bulk chemical storage tanks, reduced labor costs dramatically,
and has reduced the accident potential inhandling of regenerant.

UTILITIES CONTEND WITH COPPER TO ENHANCE CYCLE RELIABILITY
Remedies for corrosion and fouling include replacement of copper-bearing
components, improvement of condensate polishing procedures, intensive
chemistry monitoring

By:
Sheldon D Strauss, Senior Editor


The advantages of copper for heat transfer in steam generating systems are
indisputable. At the same time, corrosion of copper and copper alloys
present in condensers, feedwater heaters, etc can impact heavily on other
system components. Evidence of the problem in steam and cooling cycles is
described repeatedly in the literature and at technical meetings, and
remedial steps range from eliminating the source to removal of deposit
accumulations.
   Copper-related problems in various forms have been encountered at many
nuclear and fossil-fueled installations. Both reactor coolant and
secondary-cycle water are involved at nuclear stations. In BWR
(boiling-water reactor) plants, copper has impacted on recirc-piping
corrosion control--through interference with hydrogen water chemistry
(HWC)--and on fuel-rod integrity. Crud-induced localized corrosion (CILC)
of fuel rods results from interaction between a tenacious scale (mostly
copper-rich oxide crud) and nodular zirconium oxide deposits formed on
cladding surfaces. Ensuing thermal stresses, cracking of the oxide layer,
and spalling results in formation of pits, which can penetrate the cladding
if not arrested.
   Identified with plants having copper-alloy condenser tubing and using
filter/demineralizers for condensate cleanup, the phenomenon was reported
in 1985 to have affected 12-15% of operating BWRs.(Reference 1) While some
utilities have replaced copper-alloy condenser tubing with titanium or
stainless steel, remedies sought by others--or applied for further
performance improvement--include tightened control over the production of
Zircaloy tubing and control of copper transport to the reactor. Modified
layup and startup procedures and improved water-chemistry monitoring have
been helpful, but the area receiving greatest emphasis has been treatment
of condensate returns for removal of ionic and particulate matter.
   Considerable attention has been given to improving the design and
operation of condensate filter/demineralizers (CFDs), which incorporate
powdered ion-exchange resins for both purposes (as opposed to separate
filters and deep resin beds). Approaches taken have focused on modification
of both precoat septa and CFD vessel designs, and on improvement of the
precoating technique.(Reference 2) The latter includes use of inert fiber
in the precoat mixture, protective cellulose fiber overlays, and
bodyfeeding of precoat mixtures during service runs. These methods have
proven successful for Georgia Power Co at Plant Hatch, Philadelphia
Electric Co (Limerick and Peach Bottom), and others, with reactor-feedwater
copper levels reported in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 ppb together with
lengthened service runs.
   Step precoating, a variant on bodyfeeding, is a procedure applied at
Vermont Yankee because of deteriorating polisher performance at summer
water temperatures. To improve performance, especially for copper removal,
the utility has been using one or more step-precoat operations involving
the addition of powdered resin, fiber, and resin-fiber mixtures to
individual vessels over short periods of time with the vessels in service.
As shown in Figure 1, step precoating after 10 days has been extremely
effective.(Reference 3) On the average, use of this method has reduced
influent copper from about 4 ppb to less than 0.7 ppb, and extended summer
service runs to 20 days.
   A novel variation on this technique makes use of Ionex cation
fiber(Toray Co, Tokyo, Japan), which has excellent crud-removal properties.
Applied together with the standard coating mixture (Ecodex P-202H, Graver
Co, Union, NJ) in a second step precoat, it has been effective in removing
90% of the undissolved copper present in the condensate. Note that other
techniques are being followed for improved copper removal--unprecoated
elements, backflushable filters, and hollow-fiber filtration for
particulate matter, deep-bed vessels for dissolved copper. Limerick station
is in the process of adding the latter to supplement its CDF for two
purposes: protection from condenser inleakage, and copper reduction to 0.5
ppb.(Reference 4)
   At PWR (pressurized-water reactor) plants, corrosion problems are
centered in steam generators and take several forms: pitting under sludge
piles, denting at tube supports, and intergranular-attack/stress-corrosion
cracking (IGA-SCC). Representative of PWR experience is the history at
Northeast Utilities' Millstone Unit 2, where tube denting occurred after
the first year of operation, pitting after six years, and IGA-SCC four to
six years later (1986).
   Copper has been implicated to some degree in each of these problems,
leading to major steps by the utility to eliminate it. These include
replacement of 70/30 copper/nickel (Cu/Ni) tubing in condensers with
titanium, and in feedwater heaters and moisture separator with stainless
steel. The heater-drains cooler, the only copper-bearing component
remaining in service, will be retubed during a scheduled steam-generator
replacement outage in 1992.
   Steps are also being initiated to remove copper that has plated out on
secondary-cycle piping surfaces during the life of the plant. The preferred
approach is elevation of secondary-system pH to at least 9.6 during
operation by increasing ammonia additions. Recirculation of a high-pH
solution (ammonia plus air) during the outage is another possibility, with
the use of a more effective amine (such as di-aminoethane) for copper
dissolution as an alternative.(Reference 5) A similar procedure, described
as an elevated pH rinse, was applied to Consumers Power Co's Palisades
station to remove residual copper from the hotwell and feedwater piping
preparatory to installing new steam generators.(Reference 6)
   Fossil-fueled plants. Recognizing the sensitivity of high-pressure
cycles to copper, industry chemical guidelines limit its content in
feedwater to 2 ppb.(Reference 7) In cycles containing copper-bearing
components or lacking adequate condensate polishing, the degree of
corrosion-product transport and deposition in piping, boilers, and the
afterboiler circuit can be surprising. Attesting to this is recent
experience at Laramie River station, operated by Basin Electric Power
Cooperative.(Reference 8) The cycle is replete with copper--Admiralty brass
and 90/10 Cu/Ni in the condensers and low-pressure (l-p) feedwater heaters,
70/30 Cu/Ni tubing in the high-pressure (h-p) heaters. Affected areas
included the station's 2400-psig boilers, high-pressure turbines and f-w
heaters, pumps, valves, etc.
   Boiler-waterwall leaks that began in 1989 caused particular concern.
Examination of a section cut from a leaker in Unit 3 early in 1990 revealed
a deep pit adjacent to thick copper-colored deposits (Figure 2); analysis
indicated under-deposit caustic gouging. Subsequent visual examination of
Unit 2 revealed tiny copper particles uniformly scattered over almost the
entire surface of every tube inspected--probably typical of all three
units. It was decided to chemically clean Unit 2, and to make several
operational changes to minimize further damage from copper deposits:
increase condensate pH from 8.6-8.7 to 8.8-9.2, blanket h-p heaters with
nitrogen during outages, and shorten run lengths for deep-bed condensate
polishers.
   As a prelude to cleaning, deposit densities were determined by
energy-dispersive X-ray analysis to range from 13 to 28 g/ft superscript 2,
with copper and copper oxides constituting 61 to 80% of the total (and iron
oxide 12-14%). Screening tests indicated thata two-stage cleaning
consisting of ammoniacal oxygen solvent followed by EDTA for iron oxide
removal would effectively clean and passivate tube surfaces.
   Cleaning began by filling the boiler with demineralized water at pH
about 9 to the normal operating level. After the primary superheater was
backfilled through the attemperator sprays, the boiler was heated slowly to
about 150F, with draining to keep the swelled volume from rising above
normal drum level. Water was then drained to make room for the ammonium
hydroxide and ammonium bicarbonate solutions; these were pumped to the
boiler, and circulated through the economizer and boiler. When
concentrations appeared uniform, O subscript 2 gas was injected through the
downcomer drains while circulation (at about 150F) was continued.
   After some eight hours, with dissolution apparently complete, the boiler
was drained hot and rinsed with demineralized water through the superheater
attemperator sprays, overflowing through the drum down to the pump suction
and pumped to waste tanks. The boiler was then refilled with hot demin
water and rinsed until copper and ammonia levels allowed for discharge to
the station ponds. Next, boiler and economizer were filled again with demin
water, heated, the expansion drained, and an EDTA solution circulated with
temperature held at 275F maximum. The solvent was cooled to 150F when iron
dissolution was complete.
   The last stage, passivation and dissolution of residual copper with
gaseous O subscript 2 admitted to the downcomer drains, was completed
within 45 minutes--an important point, because boiler-tube steel can
corrode rapidly in the process.
   An astounding amount of copper was removed from the station economizers
and boilers, ranging from 2616 lb from Unit 2 to 7508 lb from Unit 1.
Inspection after cleaning showed the drums and headers of all units to be
clean and passive. Waterwall tube sections were coated with 3-4 g/ft
superscript 2 of mixed iron oxides, typical of freshly cleaned and
passivated steel surfaces.
   This experience sharpened understanding of earlier episodes involving
plugging of boiler-feedpump screens (1982-84), turbine copper deposits
(first detected in 1983), and pressure losses across h-p heater tubes
(1984-89), all treated by chemical or physical cleaning. With regard to the
h-p turbines, for example, a need for inspection and cleaning was not
indicated until a capacity-loss trend became evident early in 1990. It was
also noted that Unit 2 did not exhibit a capacity loss; that unit had less
steam attemperation, accounting for lack of copper deposits in the
turbine.
   In sum, the evidence indicates that the 70/30 Cu/Ni is de-nickelizing on
both tube and shell sides of the h-p heaters, and that the copper remaining
flakes off. This would explain the presence of copper in the attemperation
water of Units 1 and 3, and in the water of all three boilers, and
identifies the h-p heaters as the problem source.
   This resulted in two operating changes as a short-term fix: Dumping of
h-p heater drains to the condenser on startup until copper levels drop
significantly, and increasing hydrazine injection at the economizer (to 40
ppb) to encourage production of a less volatile copper form (cuprous
oxide), to minimize carryover to the turbine. A decision has already been
made to retube the h-p feedwater heaters. Additional steps initiated
include extensive monitoring for copper throughout the cycle and location
and elimination of all possible points of air ingress. Injection of
hydrazine scavenger into the crossover pipe between intermediate- and
low-pressure turbines is also under consideration.


Figure 1: Step precoating of individual demineralizers between days 10 and
20 produced sharp copper drop in effluent of vessels B, C, D, smaller
reductions for three-year-old vessels A and E. Dotted line indicates
transition

Figure 2: Boiler-tube section from Laramie River station shows heavy copper
deposit plus caustic gouging

CIRC-WATER PIPING REPLACEMENT: GIVE IT THE ATTENTION IT DEMANDS
When a vital piping system runs out of life, there is a chance to rethink
possibilities, reconsider principles, and even to come up with unique
solutions

By:
Ronald D Vering and John A Bugni, Burns & McDonnell
Edited by W O'Keefe

Circ-water piping between condensers and either cooling tower (CT) or other
heat sink is a lifeline for unit operation. Failures occur in these
large-diameter piping systems, of course, requiring repair. The repairs
usually call for little or no engineering effort. After several failures
and repairs, however, the system may become a candidate for replacement. At
this juncture, the situation justifies extensive study and engineering
work. The result is often a decision for replacement.
   Preparing for the retrofit will present several challenges, comprising
the key engineering questions about the proposed project. Look at these
challenges and then at their influence on an actual retrofit operation at a
utility station:
   --Optimizing the pipeline route. Economics require that you keep
operating-facility disruption to a minimum, and considerations concerning
space for plant operation and future expansion are three factors here.
Changes in the plant or additions to structures and equipment since the
original circ-water piping went in may influence planning, and the vertical
dimension of route is important, as well. Decision may be for an
above-ground or a below-grade installation.
   --Optimizing piping configuration. After route selection, the
configuration or layout of the piping calls for attention. An above-ground
line is quite different from a below-grade one, as one example of the
considerations. The configuration must suit site-specific conditions and
plant-operation philosophy. At this stage, primary objectives may be
reduction in disruption of plant operations and limitation of generation
downtime. Give thought, too, to how much of the retrofit lines the plant
can install without interrupting the existing circ-water lines.
   --Accommodating thermal expansion. Conventional longitudinal expansion
joints and anchors are available. Flexible couplings are also worth
considering.
   --Reducing pipe-support costs. These components of the system allow
thermal movement and relieve beam bending stress in the pipe. They also
must prevent excessive pipe movement. Pipe-support costs can be an
important factor in installation cost for the retrofit system and deserve
engineering attention.
   --Retrofitting with minimal downtime. If generation is not to be lost,
pipe installation needs care. Should an outage for installation be long,
then perhaps the plant can wait for a fairly long outage for other
repairs.

Retrofit follows precepts
   The city of Lakeland's 333-MW McIntosh Unit 3 was equipped with
7-ft-diameter circ-water pipes between condenser and cooling tower. After
several failures had occurred in the below-grade system, the Florida
utility's engineers decided to replace the lines. The study followed the
principles outlined above, and both engineering and installation faced
several unique situations.
   Optimizing the route in this case came down to a choice between two
possibilities. One was a repeat of the original below-grade choice,
following an existing secondary road in the plant. The other was an
above-ground installation through an open space in the plant's 230-kV
switchyard.
   Decision was for the above-ground configuration. Figure 1 pictures the
piping and the switchyard during construction. The decision was a difficult
one. From a plant-operation standpoint, a below-grade installation was
preferable, as even casual study of Figure 2 makes clear. Nevertheless,
going below the surface would call for extensive trench shoring to protect
existing structures and for dewatering, because of a high groundwater
table. In addition, a below-grade installation would have needed trench
depths to 15 ft in some areas to clear existing electrical duct banks.
   Because of the cost impact of these site-related installation
conditions, the above-ground configuration won out. The projected cost
saving of the above-ground over the below-grade installation was about
$3.5-million.
   Pipe-material cost was an important component of total project cost, and
therefore required evaluation during the route-selection process. Concrete,
fiberglass, and steel were the possibilities, judged on a comparable basis
that considered strength, corrosion resistance, and maintenance. Decision
would have been for concrete as most economical for a below-grade
installation. Steel was the choice for the selected above-ground system.
   Running the lines above-ground posed many unique challenges. The
configuration finally chosen, however, allowed installation of most of the
pipeline without upsetting the old circ-water system. The amount of pipe
awaiting installation during a Unit-3 outage finally amounted to only that
for tie-in at the condenser, the circulating-water pumps, and the cooling
tower, plus some pipe under a 69-kV electrical bus and a 230-kV transfer
switch in the switchyard area.
   Figure 2 outlines major considerations affecting piping configuration
and details four of the most critical design areas. It gives the choices of
routes and makes clear the pipe stretches installed during unit outage.
   Maximum access and laydown space in the area between Unit 1 and Unit 3
resulted from the stacked pipe arrangement along the west side of Unit 3
(Figure 3). Jointing of the pipe in this area, by couplings and flanges,
makes possible the dismantlement of the pipe and thereby the accommodation
of future removal of such major equipment as Unit-3 transformers. Eyes
welded at the tops of pipe spools help in this.
   The crossing (Figure 4) under both the existing 230-kV switch structure,
which transfers Unit-3 generated power to the switchyard, and the 69-kV tie
bus connecting the switchyard for Units 1 and 2 to the Unit-3 switchyard,
demanded special consideration. Clearance needs mandated raising of both
structures.
   Pipeline clearance from overhead power lines throughout the plant site,
as well as electrical bus inside the switchyard, was another concern. The
design met fault-current potential considerations by grounding the pipeline
at approximately 40-ft increments, at each pipe joint.
   Reaching the cooling tower required crossing the main plant-entrance
road. Partial burying of the pipes in this area reduced installation costs.
Although setting the bottom of the pipe about 4 ft below existing grade
eliminated need for extensive shoring and dewatering here, the concept made
necessary an adjustment to the existing road's profile to accommodate the
3-ft abovegrade projection of the 7-ft-diameter pipe, plus 30 in. of fill
over the pipes.
   Existing facilities near the road crossing further complicated road
revisions. Nevertheless, the completed change of road grade added minimal
cost without impairing existing facility access.
   At the CT, setting the replacement pipe header outside the existing CT
pipes (Figure 5) allowed installation of the new CT header during operation
of the old pipeline. In addition, maintenance cranes placed either outside
the new CT header or in the alleyway left between the new header and the CT
can remove CT equipment or work on the circ-water pumps.
   Thermal expansion of piping can make longitudinal-expansion elements and
anchors necessary, but these devices would have cost too much for the
McIntosh project. Anchoring the 7-ft above-ground pipe against its possible
470-kip internal-pressure thrust load combined with a possible 150-kip
friction load resulting from pipe movement would have been expensive. The
required route included five bend points, raising costs even higher.
   Part of the solution was to allow the pipe to move near bend points,
which eliminated need for anchors. Pipe geometry still had to be flexible
enough to give the needed thermal-stress relief, however, and there were
several locations where the geometry fell short. Inserting a set of
flexible couplings at pipe joints at these locations gave flexibility at
low cost. The couplings relieve pipe thermal stress by functioning as
hinges that allow point rotation at consecutive pipe joints. Another
purpose for flexible couplings was reduction of loads on connections to
existing equipment and piping.
   Flexible couplings for pipe-stress relief make necessary joint
harness-rod assemblies to transmit the pipe-pressure thrust force across
the couplings. Conventional multi-bolt tie-rod assemblies restrict free
rotation at the coupling, however, so the arrangement of Figure 6, with
only two bolts, one on each side of the plane of joint rotation, was
preferred. There is free hinge rotation at the coupling. The specially
designed ring-girder stiffeners in the figure are necessary to prevent
local pipe buckling in the vicinity of the harness-rod attachment.
   Four regions of interest from the thermal-expansion standpoint are
highlighted in Figure 2. Near the circ-water pumps, a tee branch instead of
a wye gives a better distribution of thermal loads on the pump connections.
At the west end of the cooling tower, an expansion loop in the connection
to the CT blowdown line reduces thermal loads on the blowdown-line
connection.
   Pipe-support costs were a key factor in installation costs. To keep
costs to a minimum, designers chose three types of supports, each intended
to accommodate pipe thermal movement and relieve beam bending stress in the
pipe.
   One type exploited the ring girders already employed at the
flexible-coupling harness assemblies, adding steel-plate support-leg
attachments welded to the girder (Figure 6). Another type, for the vicinity
of pipeline bend points, was a steel saddle welded to the pipe's haunch
area.
   The base plates for both of these support types have slide surfaces with
tetrafluoro-ethylene on both faces to permit pipe movement in all
directions. Guides prevent excessive movement.
   The third type of support, the concrete cradle, is in the straight runs
of pipe, where longitudinal movement is the sole concern.
Graphite-impregnated felt between pipe and concrete cradle eases pipe
movement on the support surface.
   To reduce costs, the pipe-support foundation system received shallow
spread footings except where loads were excessive. Where pipe loads
transmitted large moments into the foundation, pile foundations became
necessary. Only two locations required them: the stacked pipe arrangement
at the condenser and the riser pipes at the cooling tower.
   It was important in the Lakeland replacement project to minimize loss of
generation during pipe installation. The final design configuration allowed
installing most of the pipe while Unit 3 was operating. The estimate of
outage time for tie-in of that pipe was four to six weeks, assuming
double-shift work and separate crews for the condenser, switchyard,
circ-water-pump, and CT areas.
   Tie-in was set for a planned annual unit outage, but the outage duration
had to be extended beyond the normal period to allow the tie-in. For better
maintenance-time utilization during the longer-than-normal outage, Lakeland
scheduled a turbine overhaul to coincide with the tie-in.
   A single crew, working a normal 40-hr work week during a four-month
period, put in the 2220 ft of pipe scheduled for pre-outage installation.
The pipe to be installed during the outage required four weeks, with
double-shift work for the first outage week and then three weeks of single
12-hr shifts.
   During the outage, four separate crews worked in the four areas
mentioned above. Curing the coating on the pipe's field-welded closure
joints and filling and hydrotesting took about a week.
   There were no significant problems during hydrotest and return to
service of the circ-water line. Weld inspection and testing of individual
joints, done during installation of the pipe, contributed to the freedom
from trouble in the hydro test. Minor leakage occurred at one 7-ft and
several 24-in. flexible couplings, but retightening the coupling bolts to
compress the joint gaskets properly stopped the leakage.
   High vibration occurred on one circ-water pump during startup. The new
pump discharge pipe's stiffness differed from that of the old, aggravating
an inherent pump-column/pipe-system resonant frequency condition. Adding
weight to the top of the vertical circ-water pump's motor lowered the
natural frequency and eliminated the high vibration.
   Data obtained after startup indicates that pipe movement is in the
direction and of the magnitude foreseen by the system design. Long-term
reliability can be expected from the replacement system.

LOOK AT SUCTION SPECIFIC SPEED FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
Rework of experience-based limits for impeller performance makes the
concept more helpful in practical pump selection

By:
D H Cavi, Sargent & Lundy
Edited by W O'Keefe

It has been said that engineering is a blend of art and science. Hence,
phrases such as "if it looks right, it probably is" were coined.
Centrifugal-pump hydraulic design is a technology that has typified this
blend of art and science in engineering. In the hydraulic-design process,
the impeller is of primary concern. In addition, the pump's casing is
designed to accommodate the performance requirements and characteristics of
the impeller and therefore has a supporting role in the hydraulic-design
process.
   A well-designed impeller is proportioned to accelerate liquid smoothly
and uniformly from point of entry at the impeller eye, through the vane
passages, and on out to the discharge side of the impeller. If the inlet
eye is disproportionately large, the liquid acceleration may not be smooth
and uniform. In consequence, eddies can form within the impeller and cause
hydraulic instability. In severe cases, the eddies cause cavitation-like
erosion of the impeller and the casing near the impeller eye, along with
harmful pressure pulsations and vibrations.
   Certain centrifugal pumps are designed for low required net positive
suction head (NPSH subscript r). These pumps are in industrial, process,
and powerplant services where specified available net positive suction head
(NPSH subscript a) at the pump suction is relatively low. The impellers in
these pumps, typically identified as "large-eye" impellers, have had the
above-described unstable and damaging characteristics when the pumps
operate at flows away from the best-efficiency flow region on the
performance curve.
   Pump-application guidelines that caution the user on potential
limitations for impeller-inlet and -discharge design interrelations are the
focus here. Previously published guidelines, based on specific speed,
developed head, and suction lift (or suction head), can be simplified and
realigned to conform with current industry parameters of suction specific
speed (S subscript s) and specific speed (N subscript s).
   Early researchers recognized that actual performance of centrifugal
pumps deviated from the theoretical. Main causes of the deviations are
natural and inescapable phenomena--such as fluid friction, turbulence,
pre-rotation, and slip. There were no high-confidence analytical means to
compensate for the effects. Consequently, researchers quantified and
correlated the performance deviations with physical design parameters. The
correlations became a basis for design factors to bridge the gap between
theoretical and actual performance. Parameters such as "specific speed" of
an impeller (N subscript s = rpm x gpm superscript 0.5 divided by H
superscript 0.75, based on conditions at the best-efficiency point, BEP, on
the performance curve--see Reference 1) came into use to facilitate
application of design factors to the variety of impeller types that were
and still are widely used. (Note that H is head in feet of liquid.)
   Impeller specific speed N subscript s is an indication of three factors:
the shape of the flow path through the impeller, whether axial, radial, or
mixed-flow; the design proportions of the impeller at the outer (or
discharge) diameter; and the spacing between the shroud and back disc of
the impeller. Specific speed therefore concerns primarily the configuration
of the discharge side of an impeller. Figure 1 makes clear the correlation
between impeller geometry and specific speed.
   The suction capability of a pump was designated as the maximum "suction
lift" that the pump could produce at a specified flow. When this suction
lift was exceeded, the pump was said to have "lost its prime." In real
terms, the pressure at the eye of the impeller had fallen below the vapor
pressure of the liquid, causing the liquid to flash. The resulting vapor
bubbles choked the liquid flow at the impeller eye, so that the flow surged
or completely stalled.
   "Suction lift" was an adequate means of defining suction capability of
an impeller in situations where vapor pressure of the pumped liquid was
low--such as with ambient-temperature water. The concept is not adequate,
however, when vapor pressure approaches suction pressure. To account for
vapor pressure of the liquid, the concept of "net positive suction head"
(total absolute suction head minus vapor pressure of the liquid, in feet of
liquid) was devised (Reference 1).
   NPSH subscript r characteristic of a pump is determined by test. It is a
function of pump-inlet design, impeller-eye diameter, impeller-vane inlet
geometry, and speed. Researchers have found that conditions at the impeller
discharge also affect NPSH subscript r (Reference 2,3). Some pump
manufacturers clearly indicate in published performance curves that
reduction of impeller diameter can increase NPSH subscript r at a
particular flow condition.
   The Hydraulic Institute recognized that a relationship exists between an
impeller's specific speed which, as discussed above, pertains to the
impeller discharge configuration, and suction conditions. Exceeding certain
limits would increase the potential for serious trouble from "vibration,
noise, and pitting."(Reference 4)
   In 1932, the Hydraulic Institute first published charts for "upper
limits of specific speeds," correlating the specific speed of an impeller
with its developed head and either the maximum suction lift that should be
produced or the minimum suction head needed to avoid serious trouble.
   The Hydraulic Institute Standards had four charts, each for a family of
curves applying to double-suction pumps, single-suction shaft-through-eye
pumps, single-suction overhung impeller pumps, and axial and mixed-flow
pumps. Figures 2 and 3 are those for the first- and last-mentioned types.
The last version was in 1975.(Reference 4) They apply to operation at or
near BEP and base on statistics of the Institute reflecting operating
experience in industrial applications.(Reference 5)
   Of late, the concept of suction specific speed S subscript s has come
into use. An impeller's S subscript s derives from pump test data and
relates flow entering the impeller eye to operating speed and NPSH
subscript r at BEP. In a comparison of different pumps or different
impellers for a particular pump, S subscript s is a useful indication of
relative size of the impeller eye. An impeller with higher S subscript s
would require lower NPSH and would typically have a larger inlet eye than
an impeller with lower S subscript s. S subscript s therefore indicates the
inlet configuration of an impeller in the same sense that N subscript s
indicates the impeller discharge configuration.
   The curves in Figures 2 and 3 are for clear water at 85F and sea level.
This establishes vapor pressure and atmospheric pressure, allowing
conversion of lift or suction-head conditions to equivalent NPSH values.
Vapor pressure of water at 85F is 0.6 psia or 1.4 ft, and atmospheric
pressure is 34 ft of water at sea level. NPSH for conditions in Figures 2
and 3 equals 34 - 1.4 + suction head (or - suction lift).
   Additionally, for any point on the curves, there is an N subscript s
value and a corresponding head value. From these, the quantity: rpm x gpm
superscript 0.5 can be calculated from the specific-speed equation. Lift or
suction head conditions are convertible to NPSH, so S subscript s is
calculable for any curve point by dividing rpm x gpm superscript 0.5 by
NPSH subscript r superscript 0.75. For a double-suction impeller, divide
further by (2) superscript 0.5.
   Figure 4 is an example of the conversion of points in Figure 2 to
equivalents relating S subscript s to N subscript s. The family of curves
in Figure 2 reduces to a single curve for the parameters of N subscript s
and S subscript s. For other types of pumps, Figures 5-7 hold, each plotted
similarly from the Hydraulic Institute charts for the particular pump type.
The equivalent "safe" region that corresponds to the upper limit of N
subscript s on the Hydraulic Institute curves would be the area below the
Figure 4-7 curves.
   Admittedly, some pump designs may exceed the limits in the curves. In
such instances, review of test data and operating experience is advisable
to prove capability for the required duty and range of flow.
   Typically, pumps that exceed the limits have a relatively large impeller
eye (in a multistage pump, the first stage). Experience indicates that such
pumps have a comparatively narrow stable operating range, near the BEP.
Operation outside the stable range can result in liquid recirculation at
the impeller eye (eddies), causing high vibration, pitting on the impeller
and adjacent casing areas, and axial shuttling of the shaft. Prolonged
operation this way can lead to bearing and shaft-seal failure, and damage
to impeller and casing.
   The condition may not be a concern if the pump runs only in the
optimum-efficiency flow range or handles viscous liquids. Pumps below the
curve limits generally have a broader stable operating range.
   Conversely, if a pump's S subscript s vs N subscript s characteristic
falls far below the curves, the impeller eye would be comparatively small,
leading to a choking condition at certain flows. Choking can result in low
efficiency, degraded head, inlet cavitation, and recirculation (eddies) at
the impeller discharge.
   The latest edition of the Hydraulic Institute Standards (Reference 1)
does not include curves such as Figures 2 and 3. Instead, an S subscript s
value of 8500 is assumed satisfactory for most applications. The S
subscript s equation is rearranged to solve for rpm, using NPSH, and the
resulting pump speed is the suggested maximum operating speed. For pumps
with constant-speed motor drive, the next lower synchronous speed would
apply.
   Figures 4-7 indicate that a S subscript s of 8500 would be conservative
for some pumps but needs examination for others. The 8500 value is
questionable for impellers with N subscript s from around 2000 up, except
for end-suction single-inlet pumps, where 8500 would be questionable for N
subscript s of 2500 and up.
   For impellers of higher N subscript s design, Figures 4-7 indicate that
S subscript s is lower than 8500. Figure 1 makes clear that high-N
subscript s impellers have relatively small outer diameters. If S subscript
s is high, then the impeller's inlet-eye diameter is large.
   Combination of high S subscript s and high N subscript s for an impeller
indicates a relatively short flowpath between inlet and discharge, causing
an abrupt acceleration of the liquid and adversely affecting hydraulic
stability of the impeller. The slope of the Figure 4-7 curves agrees with
this analysis. According to the Hydraulic Institute standards committee
(Reference 5), impellers of low N subscript s can be designed for high S
subscript s values; this agrees with the trend of Figures 4-6 curves.
   The Hydraulic Institute curves typified by Figures 2 and 3 stemmed from
field operating experience, and the S subscript s/N subscript s curves of
Figures 4-7 have the same basis, because they were calculated directly from
the Hydraulic Institute curves.

KNOW CAUSES OF, SOLUTIONS TO CFB-BOILER REFRACTORY PROBLEMS
Refractories are used extensively in CFB boilers. Because early systems
were prone to failures, advanced refractory systems have been developed and
applied successfully

By:
M S Crowley, Consultant
Edited by Steven Collins

Circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) boilers use extensive amounts of
refractories to withstand harsh operating conditions--including
temperatures topping 2000F, frequent thermal cycling, and continuous attack
by erosive high-velocity particles. Thermal cycling alone, encountered on a
daily basis by many units, can eventually destroy almost any refractory.
Specific areas requiring protective refractories include the combustor,
cyclones, external heat exchanger (EHE), ducts, and transfer lines (Figure
1).
   Correct selection and installation of materials is critical to
minimizing refractory failures. The following material provides valuable
insights into the construction and repair of CFB refractories.

Typical CFB linings
   Refractory selection is complicated by reciprocal physical properties.
Example: Good insulating materials often have poor erosion resistance. To
make up for trade-offs, refractory systems are often made of several
materials applied in layers.
   Three general types of liner designs are used in advanced CFBs:
Waterwall and thin or thick linings for non-waterwall surfaces. Waterwall
linings, used in the combustor and cyclone areas, use short studs to hold
a thin, 1/2-2-in.-thick layer of dense refractory to the flue-gas side of
boiler tube assemblies. Conventional insulation is affixed outside to
maintain high water/steam temperatures. The linings withstand rapid
thermal upsets better than thick lining. Steel fiber is often added to
waterwall liners for toughness and shock resistance.
   Thin linings, typically 6 in. or less in total thickness and usually
have both dense and insulating layers. They are more economical to install
and maintain than thick linings. However, a hotter shell--ranging from 300
to 500F--can make thin-lined components less efficient and uncomfortable to
work around.
   Thick linings usually consist of two or three layers totaling 12-18 in.
A dense, "hot face'' of abrasion-resistant brick, plastic, or castable
protects against the erosive action of hot, high-velocity particles. Backup
layers of insulating material reduce heat loss, decrease shell
temperatures, and improve overall efficiency.

Refractory materials
   Refractories consist of mineral combinations--usually oxides--formed
into rigid shapes with the aid of a binder. They are classified as either
preformed or unformed. Preformed refractory materials--brick and tile--are
fired before installation. Unformed materials--castables and plastics--are
fired after installation to create seamless monoliths. Castables differ
from putty-like plastics in that they must be mixed with water at the work
site.
   Physical properties. To obtain desired physical properties--such as
strength, erosion resistance, and volume stability--refractory
manufacturers blend the appropriate prefired aggregates with suitable
binders. The latter includes raw clay, calcium aluminate cements, or
phosphate-based materials. The important physical properties of brick,
tile, plastic, and castable refractories differ, depending on chemical
composition and manufacturing and installation techniques used (see table).
Thermal stability, a measure of how well a material resists repeated
thermal cycling, is perhaps the most important property for CFB
applications. However, erosion-resistance, hot-strength, creep-resistance,
heat-transfer, and shrinkage characteristics must also be considered for a
given application.
   Clay binders are often added to ceramic oxides before firing when making
brick or tile. With some materials, a ceramic bond can be formed without
the help of binder by firing them at a higher temperature. Otherwise a
material that promotes bonding such as monoaluminum phosphate, may be used
to form a strong bond after firing temperatures reach 1000F.
   Because they are easy to apply and shape, monolithic refractories--both
castables and plastics--are most commonly used. Castables are composed of
calcined mineral aggregates and a calcium-aluminate or hydraulic cement,
along with additives that ease wetting and placement.
   Castables are shipped dry to the site. Water is added in a mixer if the
material is to be cast in a form, or at the gun nozzle if "gunning'' is
used to place the lining (Figure 2). Advanced castables are becoming more
popular because they offer minimal shrinkage and enhanced formability.
   Plastics are similar to castables in formulation. Both use calcined
aggregates and a binder. However, plastics--which are premixed at the
factory--use phosphates or other heat-setting agents to cause the material
to bond or "setup'' when fired. Castables use hydraulic cements which form
the permanent bond when mixed with water and fired.
   Fibers. Stainless steel fibers and organic "burn-out'' fibers are often
added to both plastics and castables. Stainless steel fibers improve
toughness and crack resistance. Organic fibers, which are finer than sewing
thread, melt or burn-out the first time a refractory is fired, leaving a
maze of tiny tunnels behind. These allow steam to escape and reduce the
occurrence of explosive spalling--particularly during the initial firing of
moisture-laden materials. Virtually no detrimental changes in physical
properties result from adding organic fiber.
   The use of ceramic fiber by itself as a refractory material is generally
limited to packing around metal components such as door jams to allow for
thermal expansion. The erosive action of sand, limestone, and ash generally
precludes the use of ceramic fiber in most areas of a CFB boiler.

Installation techniques
   To ensure that a finished castable product comes out as planned, excess
water must be kept to a minimum, manufacturer's curing instructions closely
followed, and anchors correctly positioned. Slow initial drying
periods--where temperaturesare raised at a rate of about 100-deg-F per
hour--are recommended to ensure that a new lining will not explode upon
startup. Anchors should be spaced at intervals equal to two to three times
the thickness of the lining and extend two-thirds to three-quarters of the
way through the refractory.
   A pneumatic rammer is often used to work putty-like plastics and
castables into the desired area (Figure 3). While most plastics are still
installed using rammers, advanced gunning machines are now available that
apply certain plastics by a pneumatic technique that does not require water
addition at the gun nozzle. The new gunning techniques are likely to become
more popular because they are faster, require fewer people to operate, and
allow some of the rebound to be reused rather than thrown away. In
addition, these pneumatically installed materials are said to be stronger,
denser, and longer lasting.
   Vibratory casting, a relatively new placement method, uses vibratory
action to force thick material to flow into forms. Vibratory castables have
special additives which greatly improve flowability, strength, and erosion
resistance without increasing the water content of the mixture. Gunning or
vibratory casting are the installation methods preferred for large areas
while ramming or hand-packing may be acceptable for small or
difficult-to-reach areas.
   Brick and tile are installed with little mortar using a "dip-joint"
technique. The brick is dipped into a pool of gravy-like mortar, then
installed. Only a thin coating of mortar remains on its surface. Joints are
typically 1/16 in. thick or less. This reduces the chances of creep or the
entry of pieces of slag and particulate matter.
   Contractors. The use of third-party inspectors to monitor the
installation and repair of refractories is recommended. Most owners do not
have the necessary in-house expertise to effectively oversee the
installation of advanced refractories. Preliminary testing of both the
materials and the skill-level of installation personnel will go a long way
towards reducing future maintenance costs (Figure 4).
   Refractory testing. When purchasing a refractory, it is important to
request the manufacturer's test results. Most refractory tests are based on
ASTM procedures which can be performed by many independent laboratories
(see Reference 7). Generally, flexural and compressive strengths, thermal
conductivity, erosion and thermal-shock resistance, and thermal expansion
are the main items of concern. Strengths should be measured at expected
operating temperatures to ensure an adequate service life.

Areas of most concern
   The combustion zone in many CFB units reaches temperatures of 1600 to
1800F, is usually oxygen-deficient, and is generally under a slight
positive pressure of 1 to 3 psig. Severe thermal shock and cycling are
common. Combustor temperatures may swing by 1000-deg-F in a few minutes. A
dozen or more startup/shutdown cycles in a week are possible.
   The reducing atmosphere here may call for refractories low in free iron
or iron oxide. Chemically, iron catalyzes the subsequent breakdown of CO
into CO subscript 2 and carbon. This process results in the deposition of
carbon inside refractories, which causes internal expansion and the
gradual destruction of the material.
   In most CFB units, sand, limestone, and ash act as the primary heat
exchange media to combust the coal or other organic matter. If possible,
sand should be removed after startup because it is extremely erosive. Thick
linings, consisting of 3 to 6 in. of dense erosion-resistant castable or
plastic covering a similar thickness of insulating material, frequently
fail by excessive cracking and "pinch-spalling.'' Shrinkage upon drying,
thermal shock, and creep of the hot face under compressive stresses are the
main causes of cracks. Stainless steel fibers help to reduce cracking, but
can not stop it completely. Pinch spalling occurs as bed material becomes
trapped and the lining experiences repeated thermal cycling (Figure 5).
   Phosphate-bonded mullite-based plastics stand up well in combustion-zone
service because of their good volume stability (resistance to thermal
expansion and contraction) in cyclic service and excellent erosion
resistance. These materials can be used to repair defective areas because
the phosphate binder adheres well to existing materials. To ensure that the
patch holds, a minimum of two anchors should be used. Ceramic or cast alloy
anchors are recommended for holding plastic linings exposed to extreme
temperatures. Additional anchors may also be needed to retain the
insulating layer independently.
   In the freeboard area above the combustion zone, silicon carbide (SiC)
tiles have been used to reduce erosion of waterwall tubes. Often, a silicon
carbide mortar is used behind the tile to improve heat transfer to the
tube. The tile is usually held onto the tubes with welded inserts. In
designs where the waterwall tubes extend down to the combustor floor,
linings often include a thin layer of a dense high-thermal-conductivity,
abrasion-resistant plastic or castable.
   Often SiC-based castables are initially specified on studded tubes.
These can be repaired with phosphate-bonded plastics--preferably containing
SiC aggregate for high thermal conductivity. Phosphate-bonded materials are
also recommended if the feedstock or recycle ash is high in alkali content.
Reason: Calcium aluminate cements break down under high-temperature alkali
attack.
   Cyclone inlet and barrel. Combustor roofs and cyclone inlets experience
temperatures of 1000 to 1800F, with occasional excursions above 2000F.
Here, a two-component lining of insulating material covered by a dense
abrasion-resistant layer containing stainless steel fiber has provided
acceptable service life. If severe thermal shock causes excessive cracking,
a fused silica-based castable may be used instead.
   The cyclone barrel and cone experience very severe conditions, including
temperature swings of 1000 deg F within a few minutes, repeated cycling,
and some erosion. For many thick linings, the repeated thermal shock and
cycling coupled with erosion and pinch-spalling have caused large sections
to fail. Poor results with various repair schemes have led some operators
to replace thick castable linings with brick ones made of insulating brick
or block covered with abrasion-resistant mullite brick. Repairs to these
linings can be made with phosphate-bonded plastic.
   Another possibility is to use a thinner lining made from material with a
low coefficient of thermal expansion--such as a fused silica castable.
However, most fused silica castables have low erosion resistance compared
to phosphate-bonded mullite plastics. Thus, service life is shorter.
   The cyclone cone experiences conditions similar to those of the barrel.
However, here the lining rests on the shell. Vibratory casting is
recommended for strength, erosion resistance, and low thermal expansion of
castables placed in the cone.
   Cyclone dipleg and loop seal. This area has been a source of continuing
problems in some units. Thermal shock coupled with severe erosion and
thermal cycling have resulted in repeated failures. Many of the initial
designs employed thick layers of both dense and insulating
castables--difficult materials to install properly, given the area's
confined spaces and limited accessibility. When installing linings,
insulating castable covered by vibration-cast, shock/abrasion-resistant
castable with both stainless-steel and burn-out fibers should be
considered. Erosion-resistant brick with a backup layer of insulating brick
or castable has also worked well. Phosphate-bonded plastic with stainless
steel fibers is typically used to repair existing units.
   External heat exchangers (EHE), used in some CFB designs, often employ
refractory-covered internal division walls to force ash to flow in a
pattern of hair-pin turns over a bed of heat-transfer tubes. Unlike
external walls, division walls are heated on both sides and are not
fastened to a cool shell. Lack of a supporting shell with anchors means the
wall can bend in and out of its original plane under the influence of
thermal stresses. This out-of-plane movement allows large cracks to open up
and trap circulating bed media, which aggravates the bending action (Figure
6).
   Transfer lines. The insides of transfer lines are covered with
refractories that resist erosion and thermal cycling. The most popular
choice consists of vibration-cast material having excellent volume
stability and erosion resistance. Adding stainless steel and organic fibers
is advisable. Phosphate-bonded plastics, preferably with mullite-based
aggregate for volume stability, can be considered for repairs.

Failures and repairs
   Cracks wider than 1/16 in. can trap limestone and ash particles and
eventually cause a lining failure as thermal cycling induces a wedging
action. The loss of thin layers--down to the anchor tips--can often be
tolerated if the lining is not separating from the shell. Fused
silica-based castables and phosphate-bonded plastics are popular
crack-repair materials.
   Spalling. There are two forms of spalling that are likely to occur in
CFB linings. Explosive spalling usually occurs on the initial heat-up of a
new installation when the water present in the castable or plastic is
converted to steam faster than it can escape from the lining. The buildup
of steam pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the material, at which
point the lining explodes. Organic burn-out fibers used in both castables
and plastics can greatly reduce the chance of explosive spalling. Brick
linings are usually not subject to this failure because the bricks are
prefired and moisture in mortar can escape out the joints between adjacent
bricks. Thermal-shock spalling can occur in both brick and monolithic
linings when sudden changes in temperature force the lining to expand or
contract faster than the material can accommodate the stress.
   Repair methods for spalled areas vary. Brick linings should be replaced
with more spall-resistant brick if large areas fail. Small areas can be
repaired using a phosphate-bonded plastic if an adequate number of anchors
can be installed. Monolithic linings are repaired using either
phosphate-bonded plastics--for small areas--or low-thermal-expansion
castables.
   Erosion. In general, erosion values below 10 cm superscript 3--based on
ASTM test C-704--are required for severe erosion service. A better test
runs at operating temperatures using the actual abrading media (Reference
4). Equipment for this test is not yet widely available.
   The best materials for erosion resistance are the new vibration-cast,
low-moisture castables and phosphate-bonded plastics. The erosion value
varies, depending on the material, the placement method, and the percent
water used.
   Anchor failures can be caused by several factors (Figure 7). Faulty
welding, incorrect spacing, poor anchor selection, corrosion, and
overheating are the most common causes. Ceramic and cast alloy anchors are
recommended for plastic linings because of their superior holding power and
resistance to high temperatures. Stainless steel anchors are used for
castable linings because they cost less and have excellent holding power
when properly designed. Welding specifications should be carefully reviewed
to avoid premature failure.
   Ceramic anchors usually extend all the way to the hot face while metal
anchors are held back at least an inch from the hot face. Thus, if an inch
or more of metal anchor is exposed because of erosion or spalling, an
estimate of the amount of lining left can be made. A decision on whether or
not to reline is then made based on the desired run time until the next
major shutdown.

STOKERS KEEP PACE WITH MODERN COMBUSTION
Often-subtle design and operating details ensure maximum performance from
spreader stokers firing most types of coal and solid waste fuels

By:
Neil H Johnson, Detroit Stoker Co
Edited by Steven Collins

For boilers up to 300,000 lb/hr of steam output, the traveling-grate
spreader stoker remains a viable process for burning coal or waste (Fig 1).
To keep pace with the requirements of modern steam production, improvements
have been made in many areas of the spreader-stoker system-- including
control of fuel and air flow, and emissions reduction.
   Fuel types. The spreader-stoker-fired boiler can burn a wide range of
coals, regardless of their free-swelling characteristics or Hardgrove
index. In general, bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite all can be
burned in a given unit to generate similar heat-release rates. Unlike other
boiler types, the requirements of the furnace and gas path, not the
fuel-feed systems, are the main concerns when contemplating a fuel switch.
However, the volatile-matter content of any fuel burned in a spreader
stoker should be above 20% on a dry, basis.
   Theoretically, the coal burned in spreader-stoker-fired boilers should
be sized to include equal proportions of 3/4-in. x 1/2-in., 1/2-in. x
1/4-in., and 1/4-in. x 1/8-in. particles. This ensures even spreading of
the fuel thrown out onto the moving--or vibrating--grate. However, these
sizing recommendations are impractical. To ease the task of sizing coal
correctly, empirical correlations are used. These include: "Distribution of
Sizes of Coal and Recommended Limits of Coal Sizing for Spreader Stokers''
published by American Boiler Manufacturers Assn (ABMA), Arlington, Va.
   In general, coal that is too coarse is more troublesome than coal that
is too fine. Coarse coal requires slower grate speeds and more combustion
air. Many plants are successfully burning coals finer than those specified
by the ABMA curve. However, combustion of fines does create higher levels
of unburned carbon in the flyash, especially as the percentage of
minus-16-mesh coal increases. Higher NO subscript x emissions have also
been linked to excessive fines.
   Spreader-stoker-fired boilers have also been used extensively to burn
many types of waste fuels, including:
   --Wood--from hogged trees to sawdust.
   --Garbage--as refuse-derived fuel (RDF).
   --Bagasse--sugar-cane residue.
   --Industrial wastes--paper, plastics, and wood.
   --Furfural residue.
   --Peanut shells.
   Water-cooled vibrating-grate spreader stokers burning waste fuels are
more reliable and require less maintenance than do traveling-grate units.
   Grate types. The main functions of grates in a spreader-stoker-fired
boiler are to provide a platform on which to burn fuel, to pass combustion
air, and to remove ash. Many different types of grates have been used. But
only the traveling and vibrating grates are able to balance today's
requirements for cost, efficiency, emissions control, availability, and
safety.
   With the traveling grate, fuel is propelled into the furnace towards the
rear wall of the boiler. Some of the fuel is burned in suspension, the
remainder on the grate, which moves towards the fuel-feed end of the
boiler. The speed of the grate is varied according to load. However, speed
also depends on the amount of fuel being burned per square foot of grate
area--an important design value.
   Systems can be designed to produce a heat release rate of up to 750
kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr for most bituminous coals, subbituminous coal, and
lignite. For firing low-volatile bituminous coals, maximum heat release
should be 600 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr to minimize unburned carbon loss.
   The heat-release rate for refuse fuels such as wood or bagasse can
extend up to 1-million Btu/ft superscript 2/hr. Grate speeds must be slower
for RDF to reduce wear associated with the high amount of abrasive
non-combustibles found in this fuel. Therefore, the maximum design heat
release should be limited to 750 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr.
   Design heat release rates for vibrating grate stokers are more
conservative because the vibrating action can over-agitate the fuel and ash
bed, hampering complete combustion. Units burning waste fuels having a
moisture content less than 40% have been designed for release rates up to
250 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr. Coal-burning vibrating-grate units can employ
heat-release rates up to 650 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr.
   Combustion air. Because the goal of the spreader stoker is to achieve
uniform burning over the entire active grate surface, evenly distributing
air flow throughout the grates is necessary. Careful attention must be paid
to the design of the plenum chamber under the grates. Abrupt changes in
flow direction or other hardware configurations which might cause air-flow
imbalances should be avoided. High-resistance grates, which put most of the
resistance to air flow across the grate rather than the ash bed,
significantly improve air distribution.
   Inlet-air temperature can be at ambient or preheated up to 350F when
burning bituminous or subbituminous coals. If moisture content exceeds 25%,
preheated air is recommended. Lignite, for example, requires preheated air,
typically to 400F.
   Virtually all refuse contains more than 25% moisture and requires
preheated combustion air. Air temperature should be limited to 350F for
systems burning RDF because of the varying characteristics of this fuel.
Water-cooled vibrating-grate units burning high-moisture refuse--above
35%--utilize air preheated to 650F.
   Until recently, overfire-air systems for coal-fired spreader stokers
were limited to supplying 15-18% of the overall air. In light of
increasingly restrictive NO subscript x regulations, new systems use three
levels of overfire air--supplying up to 35% of total air input--to achieve
staged combustion. Overfire air must be supplied with sufficient energy to
produce turbulence and thoroughly mix fuel with oxygen to complete
combustion. Nozzle design is the most important factor affecting the
efficient utilization of overfire-air fan energy.
   Flyash reinjection. The two factors controlling efficiency of the
spreader-stoker combustion system are excess air and carbon loss. Units
should be able to operate at 25% excess air or less if air plenums and
nozzles are designed correctly.
   Carbon loss is the sum of carbon lost in flyash and bottom ash. A
well-run and well-designed spreader stoker exhibits a very low bottom-ash
carbon loss. Therefore, efforts to minimize carbon loss concentrate on
flyash. The most popular technique is reinjecting the flyash caught by the
first-stage of ash removal--usually the mechanical dust collector.
   In the case of units burning eastern bituminous coals, the combustible
content of flyash caught in mechanical dust collectors is about 60%.
Properly designed reinjection systems can reduce this value to about 25%.
Reinjection can improve efficiency significantly and reduce the amount of
ash requiring disposal.
   Emissions. Several factors influence the amount of NO subscript x
produced by a spreader stoker, including: (1) amount of excess air, (2)
design heat-release rate, (3) air temperature, (4) fuel size distribution,
(5) method of fuel feed, and (6) furnace temperature. When possible, follow
these suggestions for reducing NO subscript x output:
   --Limit design heat release to 700 kBtu/ft superscript 2/hr.
   --Maintain under-grate air temperatures near ambient.
   --Keep coal fines--particles below 0.1-in.--to a minimum.
   --Reduce furnace temperature by staging overfire air or recirculating
flue gas.
   Spreader-stoker-fired systems convert virtually all of the sulfur found
in the fuel to SO subscript 2. Thus, some sort of post-combustion SO
subscript 2-control device is necessary. Both wet and dry scrubbers have
been used successfully. There are also many emerging technologies aimed at
combined SO subscript 2 and NO subscript x control (Power, September 1990,
p 26).

DIAGNOSTIC MONITORING--AN OVERVIEW
Diagnostic engineering is a recognized plant-maintenance function. This
article outlines the use of diagnostic monitoring for detection of
incipient failure, to facilitate predictive maintenance

By:
Otakar Jonas, Jonas Inc
Edited by Sheldon D Strauss

Utilities are in constant pursuit of methods to increase plant availability
in their ongoing effort to improve power generation and reduce operating
costs. A fast-developing approach makes use of diagnostic monitoring of key
plant components and systems as a basis for forecasting incipient failures
and for predictive maintenence. Either continuous on-line or periodic,
diagnostic monitoring includes non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques,
while expert systems, knowledge bases, and other computer-based tools
contribute to forecasting of failures.
   Upwards of 30 monitoring techniques are available for use in detection
of problems having potential impact on the integrity of almost every
component in a nuclear or fossil-fueled powerplant. Established techniques
are based on analysis of stress, crack growth, leakage, vibration,
metallic-particle content of lube oil, temperature change and distribution,
water chemistry, and corrosion. Across-the-board application of this
monitoring technology could enhance plant availability by at least 2%.
Their application to predictive rather than scheduled maintenance can
contribute to reduced forced-outage rates, shortened scheduled outages,
reduced maintenance and operating costs (through damage reduction and
efficiency increases), better record-keeping, and easier licensing.
   The value of the approach lies in its ability to diagnose abnormal
mechanical behavior at an early stage as a focal point for preventive
equipment maintenance. Thus, the information provided can help avoid a
forced outage and makes it possible to perform repairs on a scheduled
basis. It also is used to ensure that the needed parts and tools are at
hand when the equipment is taken out of service. At the same time,
monitoring systems can reduce plant downtime by avoiding unnecessary
component maintenance during a scheduled outage. Still another benefit is
assessment of equipment life.
   Incipient failure detection and predictive maintenance are addressed
periodically by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) at their
periodic "Incipient Failure Detection Conferences." (Refs 1-3 are typical.)
EPRI's Monitoring and Diagnostic Center at Philadelphia Electric Co's
Eddystone station (Philadelphia, Pa) and Non-Destructive Evaluation Center
(Charlotte, N Car) are in the forefront of development of applicable
diagnostic methods. Much can be learned from proceedings and reports
emanating from these and other sources, some of which are referenced
below.4-12 Technical Briefs issued periodically by EPRI are another
particularly useful source.
   Rather than an in-depth review of the subject, this discussion is
limited to a brief overview of practical diagnostic monitoring methods
available to the industry. Diagnostic monitoring involves a range of sensor
types and signal forms covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
Depending on the particular component under study, a predictive maintenance
system will usually make use of several of these diagnostic monitoring
systems, grouped according to application.
   Crack, leak detection. (1) Helium and SF subscript 6 are used as tracers
to locate leaks in steam condensers and general air inleakage, in
conjunction with a mass spectrometer. (2) Acoustic monitors (resonant
100-900 kHz transducers) detect minute shock waves generated by cracks,
material and weld defects, rubbing, or plastic deformation; audible- and
ultrasonic-frequency microphones or acoustic-emission transducers detect
energy generated by a leaking fluid; broad-band acoustic sensors mounted on
piping downstream of valves detect noise produced by flow turbulence. (3)
Fatigue monitors are used to calculate fatigue stresses and life from
temperature and pressure transients. (4) Special electrical conductivity
probe measures moisture on vessels and piping.
   Bearing condition. (1) Ultrasonic piezoelectric sensors embedded in
bearings enable detection of wear through measurement of bearing-pad
thickness. (2) Spectrophotometry is used to monitor non-metallic compounds
in oils by infrared absorption; ferrography is a technique for examining
the composition, size distribution, and quantity of metallic particles in
lubricating oil. (3) Oil temperature is monitored in comparison to baseline
temperature as indicative of a problem, but the method may not have
sufficient sensitivity in particular cases.
   Rotating machinery. (1) Vibration signature analysis is used for
monitoring vibration frequencies, amplitudes, and phases; rotor cracks
(including shallow, transverse types) are detected by use of 1st, 2nd, and
3rd harmonics to separate vibration signals from background noise;
rotor-dynamics balance technique uses vibration signature analysis to track
and diagnose rotor/bearing vibration problems; laser doppler vibrometers
can be used to scan rotating surfaces periodically to measure vibration
amplitude and frequency. (2) Rotor/shell stress analysis is used to compute
thermal stresses from steam and metal temperatures to determine fatigue
damage in thick sections of turbines, nozzles, headers, and piping. (3)
Turbine-blade condition monitor uses acoustic techniques to detect blade
cracks, row damage, flutter, and torsional events in turbines. (4)
Surface-layer activation involves implantation of radioisotopes into metal
surface, plus collection and analysis of debris for nuclide content, to
monitor wear and solid-particle erosion; remaining surface radioactivity
can also be monitored continuously for same purpose.
   Electrical-equipment condition. (1) Motor-current analyzers monitor the
frequency spectrum of electric current supplied to electric components. (2)
Thermography is a method for pictorially recording emission of infrared
radiation by hot spots. (3) Radiofrequency analyzers monitor generator
radio waves to detect arcing.
   Water level, induction, chemistry, corrosion. (1) Water level is
monitored in comparison to reference level by various methods including
ultrasound, conductivity probes, and gamma gauges. (2) Water induction and
waterhammer in steam pipes are monitored by gamma gauges, conductivity
probes, and fast-response thermocouples. (3) On-line, in-line pH monitors
track acidity/alkalinity inside components under operating conditions;
variety of specific ion, gas, particle, temperature, and pressure detectors
are used to analyze water and steam composition throughout the cycle, help
determine sources of impurities and corrosion and deposition in components,
with computerized expert systems providing useful adjunct. (4) Corrosion is
tracked by monitoring H subscript 2 concentration in water and steam;
corrosion-current or water-resistance monitors make use of in-line probes
for same purpose; in-line corrosion-potential probe relates corrosion
potential to type of corrosion under way.
   Miscellaneous. (1) Filter malfunction is detected by monitoring leakage
through filters by particle impact and other methods. (2) Flow rate
monitors compare fluid-flow rate to baseline rate. (3) Particle detectors
provide qualitative or quantitaive information on flow of particles and
liquid droplets in steam lines and air and gas systems. (4) Transformer oil
condition is tracked by monitoring H subscript 2 produced by oil
degradation. (5) Valve-stem strain sensors measure force on valve stems.

GAS TURBINES PACE NEW CAPACITY ADDITIONS
The relentless march of gas turbines into the powerplant arena results from
continued advances in efficiency, ultra-low NO subscript x emissions, coal
compatibility, and unit output. The latest target: base-load power supply

By:

Gas turbines have long been popular as prime movers for a variety of
gas-compression and power-generation applications. Since the 1950s, they
have been used in remote oil and gas fields, on offshore drilling
platforms, and in gas-pipeline pumping stations. In these locations, where
fresh water is often scarce, premium fuel supplies cheap, or space
requirements limited, compact gas-turbine sets have proved invaluable. And
thanks to its quick-start capabilities--as little as 10 minutes from
startup to full load for large machines and less for smaller
ones--gas-turbine/generator packages also found a niche in the market for
backup- and peaking-power systems.
   More-recent advances, such as increased efficiency and fuel flexibility,
have enabled large gas-turbine-based combined-cycle systems to compete with
conventional powerplants for new base-load generating capacity in many
areas. Gas-turbine-based systems below 100 MW have gained widespread
acceptance for industrial power and cogeneration applications (Fig 1).
   Increased efficiency. Large industrial machines--100 MW and up--are now
breaking the 35% simple-cycle efficiency mark. Natural-gas-fired
combined-cycle facilities based on these gas turbines have net efficiencies
topping 50%. And a recently introduced 40-MW aeroderivative reached a new
milestone--the first commercial gas turbine with a reported simple-cycle
efficiency above 40% (see box, p 64).
   Efficiency of large gas turbines continues to be improved today by
raising turbine-inlet temperatures (TIT). When increasing TIT, it is
necessary to increase the compressor pressure ratio, which is the
compressor-outlet pressure divided by its inlet pressure. The newest large
machines feature TITs as high as 2370F and pressure ratios up to 16:1.
   To withstand these extreme temperatures, advanced gas turbines depend
upon state-of-the-art materials, component designs, and manufacturing
techniques. An improved class of superalloys allows metal components to
operate at temperatures only 600 deg F below their melting point for
thousands of hours--even under severe centrifugal, thermal, and vibratory
stresses.
   Because even superalloys begin to melt once temperatures near 2200F,
internal air-cooling circuits are used to cool components in a turbine's
hot gas path. They draw air from the compressor outlet or interstage
locations to cool the combustor liner, the outer shell of the
combustor-to-turbine transition piece, and the first few stages of moving
blades and stationary nozzles. One manufacturer uses ceramic tiles and
air-cooled heat shields to protect gas-path liners from high temperatures
and related thermal loading.
   Thermal barrier coatings protect combustion liners on new
high-temperature units. These coatings are plasma-sprayed onto the hot side
of the combustion liner in thicknesses up to 0.015 in. For each 0.001 in.
of coating, there is a reported 8- to 16-deg-F drop in the liner's surface
temperature. Finally, a manufacturing process known as directional
solidification is used by select manufacturers to improve the low-cycle
fatigue properties of cast components.
   Low emissions. Several methods are used to reduce gas-turbine NO
subscript x emissions, including: (1) injecting steam or water into the
combustion zone, (2) using dry low-NO subscript x burners, or (3) including
a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system in the exhaust train. Dry
burner systems--which reduce NO subscript x production through advanced
control of combustion parameters--have several obvious advantages: (1)
Steam and water injection reduce overall thermal efficiency, and (2)
catalytic reduction entails handling ammonia and disposing of spent
catalysts that contain heavy-metal oxides.
   Two manufacturers reportedly have developed dry burners which can reduce
gas-turbine NO subscript x emissions to below 10 ppm--at 15% excess O
subscript 2--for natural-gas-fired machines (see box, p 63). Machines using
these advanced burners also display near-zero CO emissions and unburned
hydrocarbon levels below 10 ppm when operating at full load. However, CO
emissions may suffer at less than 50% load. One manufacturer estimates
that, compared to a coal-fired plant of similar size, a combined-cycle
powerplant based on these gas turbines outputs 53% less CO subscript 2.
   For units firing distillate fuels, steam or water injection has been
used to cut NO subscript x emissions to 25 ppm. In areas such as California
and Japan, where NO subscript x-control regulations are stringent,
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia injection has been used to
further reduce NO subscript x levels. SO subscript 2 emissions from gas
turbines burning premium fuels are negligible.
   Increased unit outputs. The scale-up of gas turbines has played a major
role in the machine's penetration into the base-load powerplant market.
What may be the world's most powerful gas turbine, a 212-MW machine for
50-Hz service, was chosen by Tokyo Electric Power Co to anchor a 2600-MW,
combined-cycle plant--the largest facility of this type planned to date--to
be constructed in the mid-1990s. The most powerful 60-Hz machine in
operation exceeded its base-load design output of 150 MW in 1990 when it
entered service at Virginia Electric & Power Co's Chesterfield station (Fig
2). The unit is part of a 214-MW, combined-cycle powerplant.
   Coal compatibility. Perhaps the most important advancements
underway--upon which the future confidence of gas-turbine users may
hinge--are those being made in coal combustion technologies (Power special
report, Combined-Cycle Powerplants, June 1990). The most promising of
these, coal gasification (CG) and pressurized fluidized-bed combustion
(PFBC), utilize gas turbines in efficient, environmentally sound,
combined-cycle schemes.
   Commercial-scale coal-gasification/ combined-cycle (CGCC) plants have
been successfully demonstrated in the US. While the installed cost of these
facilities is still significantly higher than that of a natural-gas-fired
combined-cycle plant, the economic viability of CGCCs is sure to increase
if and when the price of natural gas escalates, as many industry observers
believe it will. Developers of CGCC plants have already found niche markets
for their facilities--such as in areas where coal is readily available and
natural gas is not, or as part of utility repowering projects, which
increase overall plant output and efficiency while reducing SO subscript 2
emissions. Several large-scale CGCC plants are now being developed
worldwide.
   The world's first PFBC/combined-cycle facility is currently operating at
the Vartan district-heating facility in Stockholm, Sweden. Main components
include two PFBC modules, two gas turbine/generators, two turbine-exhaust
economizers, and one steam turbine/generator. At full load, the new
facility delivers 135 MW to the electric grid and 225 MWt to the district
heating system at an overall thermal efficiency of close to 90%. The gas
turbine/generators supply about 25% of the electric power output from the
plant, the steam turbine/generator the balance. Parasitic power is 11 MW,
including the power needed to operate the heating circuits's hot-water
pumps. Two similar units are operating-- one in Spain and one at American
Electric Power Service Corp's Tidd station (Power, April 1991, p 103).

ADVANCED BURNERS REDUCE NO SUBSCRIPT X EMISSIONS

Dry low-NO subscript x burners represent an area of gas turbine technology
where significant improvements have been made recently. To illustrate: One
gas-turbine manufacturer guaranteed San Diego Gas & Electric Co (SDG&E)
that NO subscript x emissions from a newly installed 100-MW gas turbine
will not exceed 9 ppm for natural-gas firing--without water/steam injection
or an SCR system. The "hybrid'' burner used on this unit can operate in two
modes--as a conventional diffusion burner or as a low-NO subscript x premix
burner.
   In conventional diffusion burners, fuel and air are mixed and combusted
in the same space. This can lead to poor mixing and cause correspondingly
high thermal-NO subscript x production. With low-NO subscript x burners,
premixing of fuel and air allows combustion to occur with a uniform and
relatively high degree of excess air, promoting lower flame temperatures
and reducing NO subscript x production.
   The hybrid burner represents the current state-of-the-art in dry low-NO
subscript x combustion technology (Fig A). Hybrid burners operate as
diffusion burners in the 0-40% load range, because the premix-burner flames
are too unstable to support combustion at low loads. At 40% of base load,
changeover to the premix burners occurs. In this mode, natural gas is mixed
with the primary air by a series of jets upstream of the burner's diagonal
swirler. Flame stability and low emissions are maintained throughout the
remainder of the load range by: (1) maintaining pilot flames on all burners
between 90 and 100% load, (2) using variable-pitch guide vanes on initial
compressor stages, and (3) using mechanical secondary-air shutters in the
combustion chambers to further reduce primary air flow at lower loads.
   The hybrid arrangement allows all four of the machine's burners to
operate identically throughout the unit's load range. When operating on
distillate fuels, steam or water can be injected through ports in the
burners to maintain NO subscript x levels below 50 ppm. At least two other
manufacturers have recently developed premix burners capable of holding NO
subscript x levels below 25 ppm.
   The main difficulty to overcome with premix burners is achieving a
stable flame, especially during load changes. One design accomplishes this
by using adjacent groups of identical dual-fuel conical premix burners (Fig
B). In this system, the stability of premix burner flames is maintained in
two ways: First, the burner's conical design causes a stabilizing
vortex-breakdown region at the center of the flame. Second, during startup
and low loads, groups of the premix burners are operated in a pilot mode
and act to stabilize adjacent burners.
   Another type of premix burner utilizes staged-combustion techniques to
maintain flame stability and low NO subscript x levels over a machine's
entire load range (Fig C). During startup and low loads, fuel is supplied
only to the burner's first stage, which operates in the diffusion-flame
mode.
   In this mode, combustor metal temperatures limit the amount of heat
released and thus lower the firing temperature and NO subscript x
production. As load continues to increase, a flame is ignited in the second
stage. It is initially a diffusion flame as well--in the lean/lean
mode--but fuel splitting limits flame temperatures and residence times to
control NO subscript x production. At 75% load, all fuel is transferred to
the second stage and the first stage flame extinguishes. Then up to 80% of
the fuel is slowly metered back to the first stage, which acts like a
mixing chamber, with the premix flame residing only in the second stage.
Flame stability is maintained by a small diffusion-flame subpilot in the
second stage.

Figure A: Hybrid burners (above) have been used to drop NO subscript x
emissions below 10 ppm.

Figure B: Dual-fuel low-NO subscript x burner (figure below, left) has no
separation between premix and combustion zones, and is said to be
compatible with both annular and external combustors.

Figure C: Staging of fuel between two combustion regions is another method
of minimizing NO subscript x formation (below right)

AERODERIVATIVE UNITS FEATURE HIGH EFFICIENCY, AIRCRAFT-ENGINE PARTS
COMPATABILITY

The thermal efficiency of one recently introduced 40-MW aeroderivative gas
turbine tops 40%. Approximately 80% of its components are borrowed from an
aircraft engine used in modern wide-body jets. The unit's 14-stage
high-pressure (h-p) compressor, two-stage h-p turbine, five-stage
low-pressure (l-p) turbine, and combustor are identical to those used in
the aircraft engine-- except for minor seal changes and a modification to
the turbine shaft needed for coupling to the generator. Its five-stage l-p
compressor is borrowed from an existing aeroderivative design.
   A variable-inlet guide-vane system modulates air flow during startup,
shutdown, and part-load operation. A variable bleed system is also added to
match air flows between the l-p and h-p compressors during off-load
conditions. The modified rear frame area of the engine provides an
l-p-rotor thrust-balance system, necessary to offset the 60,000 lb of
thrust lost with the elimination of the engine's fan.
   The unit weighs over six tons and is only 14 ft long. For
natural-gas-fired units, NO subscript x emissions are expected to be held
to 25 ppm by using steam injection and 42 ppm by injecting water. For
base-load service, 25,000 hours of operation is expected between
hot-section maintenance outages, and 50,000 hours between overhauls.
   Another manufacturer of aeroderivative gas turbines has developed a
26-MW unit with a simple-cycle thermal efficiency of over 39% (photo). A
popular combined-cycle configuration for this model includes two gas
turbines driving a single generator, an HRSG, and a steam
turbine/generator. For this arrangement, gross plant output is 67 MW and
efficiency tops 50%.
   Major advantages of this aeroderivative engine include:
   -- Gas-turbine changeout requires only eight hours.
   -- Starting time--cold start to power generation--is three minutes.
   -- Auxiliary components are of a modular design.
   -- Site required is small--105 x 130 ft for a 33-MW plant, 140 x 160 ft
for 67 MW.

ICE MAKER ADDS LOW-COST KILOWATTS TO PEAKING UNIT

   The move beyond evaporative coolers to stretch gas-turbine output
(Power, July 1991, p 27) is most recently, and perhaps most vividly,
illustrated by the installation of a large inlet-air chiller at Lincoln
Electric System's (Lincoln, Neb) Rokeby station (Figure 1). Although the
project was completed last September, only one day of testing and shakedown
was possible before the cold, according to officials from Burns &
McDonnell, Kansas City, Mo, the owner's engineer for the project. But for
around $165/kW and no expected increase in operating costs, Rokeby's output
will be increased by up to 22% during hot weather. A 4% reduction in heat
rate is anticipated.
   The objective at Rokeby, like several other recent projects, is to
overcome a fundamental shortcoming of gas-turbine peakers--that power
output is inversely proportional to inlet air temperature. But the Rokeby
project is distinguished by the use of thermal energy storage (TES) instead
of mechanical, absorption, or hybrid chillers integral to the gas
turbine/generator. This way, low-cost, off-peak nuclear- or coal-based
power is used to drive the TES system, not power from the peaking unit.
Rokeby's TES system is believed to be the largest for this type of
application in North America.

Hungry for mass flow
   The gas turbine/generator at Rokeby is an early-vintage MS7001B,
supplied by General Electric Co, Schenectady, NY. Peak rating of the
machine, 65 MW when firing distillate fuel at ISO conditions, deteriorates
to 53 MW at 100F inlet air temperature. An evaporative cooler originally
included with the gas turbine maintained output at 57.8 MW at this
temperature. Although installed in 1975, the gas turbine has operated a
total of only 1500 hours.
   Being a mass-flow machine, the gas turbine's output improves as inlet
air temperature decreases and density increases. Reducing inlet air
temperature to 40F increases output by 11 MW above that obtained with the
evaporative cooler operating. To do this, ice is produced, stored as an
ice/water bath, then used to cool inlet air when the gas turbine operates.

Harvesting ice
   Main components of the Rokeby TES system are a refrigeration unit,
ice/water storage tank, and air cooling coils. A traditional ammonia-based
cycle is employed for refrigeration. It consists of a compressor, three
evaporators, and one evaporative condenser.
   System works this way: Cold water from the bottom of the storage tank is
pumped to the refrigeration unit on top of the tank. The three ice-making
evaporators (Figure 2), spaced symetrically around the top of the tank,
cycle between freezing and shedding. That is, ammonia refrigerant passing
through the evaporator coils allows ice to form on the outside of the
coils, then a hot-gas bypass off the low-pressure refrigerant compressor
passes through the coils, melting the ice which subsequently drops directly
into the storage tank (Figure 3). Ice-making capacity is around 23
tons/hr.
   Gas-turbine inlet air passes through the shell side of a heat exchanger
with chilled water pumped from the ice/water tank through the coils.
Indirect heat transfer was selected over direct contact because it was
thought to provide superior protection of the gas turbine against
impurities in the chilled water.
   Cooling coils are spiral-wound copper tubes with aluminum fins. Design
chilled-water inlet temperature is 34F, design turbine-inlet-air
temperature drop is from 101 to 40F. Maximum allowable pressure drop is
0.5 in. H subscript 2 O. Water that condenses out of the turbine inlet air
is collected and routed to site drainage.
   An inlet air temperature of 40F is considered the lowest safe
temperature for avoiding icing of the compressor. As combustion air is
drawn into the compressor, static air pressure drops because of friction
and increased velocity; a corresponding drop in temperature is experienced
as well. Thus air below 40F could eventually drop below freezing by the
time it reached the first stage of compressor blades.
   Another concern was differential expansion of the compressor rotor and
stator as inlet temperature decreased by 60F. To guard against this, a
five-minute, air cooldown ramp will be used after the engine reaches full
speed. In addition, the cooling system is shut down along a five-minute
ramp.
   The ice/water bath is stored in a cast-in-place concrete tank installed
below grade to take advantage of the insulating effect of the soil and to
provide piping-system drainage in the off-season. Ice is distributed by
gravity and floats like a iceberg until the portion below the waterline
reaches the bottom of the tank. This stabilizes the ice pile and allows it
to accumulate in a cone shape. Rotating water sprays continually
redistribute the ice as the size of the cone increases to prevent build up
under the ice-making evaporators.
   Control of the TES system is based on monitoring the inlet air
temperature to the gas turbine. As it increases, a programmable logic
controller signals two butterfly valves to open proportional to the change
in air temperature. The butterfly valves regulate the flow of chilled water
to the coils. Safeguards were added to ensure that the turbine is protected
against minimum temperatures that could lead to ice ingestion into the
turbine's compressor. Interlocks are also provided for periods of reduced
air flow during startup and shutdown.

Exercising the system
   Rokeby's TES system operates on a weekly cycle. It produces ice for 148
hours and melts ice by cooling turbine inlet air 20 hours a week. Each
weekday, ice typically is produced 20 hours and melted four hours; weekends
are dedicated to ice-making. This cycle meets the requirements of Lincoln's
power pool for peak-capacity accreditation.
   Establishing a weekly cycle, instead of a daily or yearly one, involved
optimization among refrigeration capacity, off-peak power consumption, and
ice-storage capacity. The weekly cycle calls for less refrigeration and
power but more storage. An added benefit of greater storage is more thermal
inertia that helps assure a low water-supply temperature to the coils
throughout the operating cycle.

Machine modifications
   Although not required, Lincoln engineers decided to replace the
turbine's inlet guide vanes with ones capable of passing higher air flow.
This increased the turbine's output by an additional 2 MW or 4% above the
machine's capacity at 100F inlet air temperature. The original evaporative
cooler has been removed.
   Also, as part of the Rokeby retrofit, natural gas was brought to the
site and the machine outfitted for dual-fuel firing. The move allowed the
plant to offset what the state authorities considered an increase in the
absolute NO subscript x emissions that would occur with the TES operating
in conjunction with a distillate-oil-fired gas turbine.
   According to Byron Bakenhus, project engineer, Rokeby is now expected to
be among the lowest-cost producers of peaking power in the Mid-Continent
Power Pool. As such, operating hours for the unit should increase.

DEVELOPMENTS TO WATCH

By:
Jason Makansi


The fortunes of coal-bed methane, like many alternative fuels, seem to rise
and fall in the sea of conventional fuelprices. When trouble erupts in the
oil/gas market--the most recent being the Persian Gulf War--and prices
rise, development of coal-bed methane gets attention. When prices fall,
activity dissipates. In the guise of an environmental liability, however,
coal-bed methane has piqued the interest of some engineers in recent
months.
   Methane has been labeled a greenhouse gas with a potential warming
effect up to 10 times that of CO subscript 2, the most voluminous
greenhouse gas.
CO subscript 2 makes up about half of the so-called atmospheric
greenhouse-gas inventory, methane around 18%. Based on these two
parameters, anyway, methane emissions should be causing more alarm than CO
subscript 2 emissions.
   EPA studies have estimated that more than 10% of the worldwide emissions
of methane are associated with coal mining activities. Traditionally,
methane from coal mines is vented to the atmosphere to protect miners and
property around mines from catastrophic explosions and health hazards.
   Coal-bed methane exists naturally in varying quality levels--ranging
from essentially air with trace quantities of methane to a
high-heating-value product that rivals natural gas. And, it must be
collected and distributed to potential user sites. If not of high-enough
heating value, this proposition becomes uneconomic.
   At least one company, O'Brien Energy & Environmental Systems,
Philadelphia, Pa, is pursuing firm business plans for coal-bed methane that
includes cogeneration at the site or the distribution of the gas to
existing and future cogeneration and small-power sites. In addition to many
landfill-gas-powered generating systems, O'Brien owns several
natural-gas-fired cogeneration facilities ranging up to 100 MW capacity in
Connecticut, New Jersey, Florida, and California.
   The firm's initial foray is a joint venture with Cosap Inc, Dallas, Tex,
to develop 15,000 acres of coal-bed methane reserves in southwestern
Pennsylvania. An estimated 40-billion ft superscript 3 of gas is available
at this site. According to O'Brien officials, when fully developed, this
field could supply one-third of the fuel consumed at the company's two
large New Jersey cogeneration facilities, representing a total of nearly
140 MW.
   Whether by O'Brien or others, extensive development of coal-bed methane
involves some knotty legal and institutional roadblocks. Uncertainties
exist about who owns the rights to methane recovered during coal mining
operations. Also, unsound recovery techniques could lead to groundwater
pollution.

Water/fuel emulsions may be the answer for controlling NO subscript x
emissions from oil-fired gas turbines, especially if the unit is operated
infrequently. Tests at two sites with different machines confirm high NO
subscript x removal levels.
   Process-wise, the technique is similar to conventional water injection
into the combustor. In both, the vaporization of water reduces peak flame
temperature in the combustors, adds mass flow to the turbine, but also
penalizes system heat rate.
   Emulsified residual fuel oil has been proven to control particulate and
NO subscript x emissions from boilers. Nalco Fuel Tech, Naperville, Ill,
and Public Service Electric & Gas Co, Newark, NJ, have extended the
technology to gas turbines firing liquid fuels, such as distillate oil.
   Initial work was conducted at PSE&G's Burlington station on an
early-1970s FT-4 gas turbine supplied by Turbo Power & Marine Systems Inc,
Farmington, Conn. Firing pre-emulsified fuel containing 10-15% water
reduced NO subscript x emissions by 50% or more. Stability of the fuel was
unacceptable, however.
   Further work took place at the Kearny station, also equipped with
early-1970s machines. An emulsification system--consisting of a water pump,
control valve, chemical metering pump, and an in-line emulsifier--was
designed and installed. A proprietary surfactant/stabilizer package is used
to keep fine water droplets well-dispersed in the oil, particularly as it
travels under high temperatures and pressures. The emulsifier system feeds
a single A-4 engine operating as part of a 35-MW Twin-Pak.
   Results were encouraging. Immediate NO subscript x reductions were
obtained when small amounts of water were emulsified into the fuel. When
the water level reached 35%, close to 70% NO subscript x reduction was
measured. Plume opacity disappeared when the emulsion contained between 13
and 17% water.
   These results appeared even more favorable when compared to conventional
water injection rates employed by another utility on a recent-model gas
turbine with hybrid burners. Around 50% more NO subscript x reduction was
accomplished using emulsions with equivalent water-addition rates.
   Tests of the PSE&G gas turbine in a natural-gas/fuel-emulsion co-firing
mode were also revealing. When oil comprised 15% of the total fuel input
and was emulsified with around 85% water, NO subscript x emissions were
reduced by 77% over the baseline value. No problems operating the unit were
documented as a result of using oil/water emulsions nor were any deposits
noted on turbine internals.
   Long-term tests, now underway at Kearny, include 200 to 400 operating
hours on two separate machines firing oil/water emulsions followed by
thorough hot-side inspections. A 1500-hr reliability test is also planned.
Engineers expect to more thoroughly investigate heat-rate penalties, power
output boosts, and changes in CO emissions.
   In Berlin, Germany, one 83.5-MW gas turbine at the Wilmersdorf station,
originally equipped with water injection, was also retrofitted with a
water/oil emulsion system. The plant, owned by Berlin's utility, Bewag, was
operating in cogeneration/district-heating mode but after unification,
authorities determined that peaking would be more appropriate.
   According to engineers close to the project, advantages of using
emulsions instead of straight water injection are: (1) The gas turbine's
combustor is not affected, and (2) emulsions more uniformly distribute the
water in the most critical region of the flame. The gas turbine, supplied
by European Gas Turbine Co, Paris, France, has always fired distillate
oil.
   Of particular interest is that emulsifying agents are not added to the
fuel. Only an in-line static oil/water mixer is installed downstream of the
oil and deionized-water pumps. A residence time of less than 24 seconds
between emulsifying and firing ensures the stability of the mixture.
   NO subscript x emissions achieved are shown in Figure 1. As important,
other operating parameters did not deteriorate, particularly noise,
combustion properties, and CO emissions. Only at loads below the range of
the gas turbine could CO emissions increase above the 100 mg/Nm superscript
3 limit governing the site.
   A long-term test was also successful and helped to evaluate mechanical
modifications required of the fuel supply system and the overall control
scheme. Wilmersdorf now plans to convert all three of its machines to burn
water/fuel emulsions for NO subscript x control.

Direct-contact condensers (DCC) could increase unit availability by up to
3% compared to conventional shell-and-tube condensers, according to D
Bharathan, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colo, and P
D'Errico, Stone & Webster Engineering Corp, Boston, Mass. Other benefits
include a slightly lower heat rate, ease of maintenance, cleaner
heat-transfer surface, shorter condenser height and thus lower plant
profile, better part-load performance, and better control of dissolved O
subscript 2.
   In the proposed system (Figure 2), the DCC is a vacuum vessel with
internal packing that enhances contact between steam from the turbine and
cooling water. Cooling water is essentially condensate that is returned to
the DCC through a pump-around loop. Note that the DCC concept used here is
similar to the one used in dry cooling systems throughout the world. A set
of parallel-plate heat exchangers transfers heat from the condensate to the
cooling-water loop. The plate heat exchangers (PHE) form the barrier
between cooling water and condensate.
   Because there are far fewer joints in a PHE than in a conventional
condenser, the potential for leakage--the number-one problem with
condensers and a significant cause of unit forced outages--is greatly
diminished. Pressure of the condensate side of the PHE is higher than for
the cooling-water side, helping to prevent in-leakage of contaminants into
the condensate. In addition, heat-transfer rates are double, and fouling
factors are at least five times lower than those for surface condensers.
When cleaning is necessary, individual PHE modules can be taken out of
service with no blip in performance.
   Tradeoffs in design include the need for 30% more heat-transfer area
than a surface condenser, need for a pump-around loop which consumes
auxiliary power and increases system complexity, and adequate filtration
and treatment for biofouling of the cooling water stream to prevent
plugging. Cooling-water passages in PHEs are much narrower than in surface
condensers.

Probabilistic modeling is a multi-functional statistical tool made
practical by the advent of high-speed computing power. In the powerplant
arena, it is being used to characterize uncertainties in the performance
and cost of advanced powerplant technologies (Figure 3) and to assess the
fate of toxic substances in existing and new powerplant designs.
   The unique feature of probabilistic modeling is that it expresses
uncertainty in a process parameter or input assumption not as a single
value as with more common deterministic approaches, but as a probability
distribution indicating the likelihood of various outcomes. Interactions
between uncertainties are also better accounted for. It is particularly
suited to analyzing parameters whose values are very likely to be
uncertain. This includes trace quantities of pollutants at or near the
limits of detection.
   The technique allows you to estimate the frequency that a particular
value of interest might be exceeded. So, given specific uncertainties
inherent to the system under study, the model can conclude that there is a
90% probability a given trace substance will not exceed regulated limits.
   In general, the application of probabilistic modeling becomes more
necessary as more parameters become important, even critical to the success
of the design. For example, if the designer is worried about cost, energy
efficiency, reliability, as well as the discharge of a variety of regulated
pollutants, then probabilistic modeling provides a greater degree of
insight into how design tradeoffs affect those performance parameters.
   In the case of comparing two or more plant designs or technologies,
probabilistic modeling allows each design to reflect the degree of
confidence of the designer in his input assumptions. Simultaneous
input-parameter uncertainties are propagated through an engineering model
to yield an explicit indication of the full range of uncertainties in
output values.
   To fine-tune an R&D program, probabilistic modeling allows the most
uncertain components of given design to be identified and quantified. This
allows better placement of priorities and, subsequently, allocation of
research funds.
   One price for this insight is computing time. To illustrate: To compare
two integrated-gasification/combined-cycle (IGCC) plant designs, a
deterministic analysis might take a half-hour or less of computer time. A
probabilistic analysis could take between six and 12 hours. In addition,
the amount of input information required for probabilistic modeling is far
greater. For more information, contact Ed Rubin or Christopher Frey,
Carnegie Mellon University, Center for Energy & Environmental Studies,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

UPGRADE INDUSTRIAL GAS TURBINES WITH ELECTRONIC TRANSMITTERS

Recently, a major manufacturer of industrial gas turbines upgraded the
instrumentation package on its line of machines. Existing mechanical relays
and switches were replaced with modern electronic devices, such as the
pressure transmitters shown in the photos. The older devices monitored
discrete setpoints like pre-start values, plus low, high, and shutdown
levels.
   At the beginning of the upgrade program, the decision was made to
install such analog monitoring devices as sensors, transducers, and
transmitters on the turbines and link them to a programmable logic
controller (PLC). By switching from mechanical relays to electronic
transmitters, the manufacturer gained the ability to closely monitor and
control its equipment, as well as the convenience of replacing two, three,
and sometimes four switches with one analog device.
   With the electronic transmitter, all alarms, shutdowns, and pre-start
cycles are controlled by the PLC. New setpoints require just a few
keystrokes to update the software--not a hardware switch to new relays. The
pressure transmitters provide analog signals for these parameters: fuel
system, lube-oil system, hydraulic (servo) system, turbine-compressor
discharge, boost-compressor suction and discharge, boost-compressor seal
system.
   The upgrade meets user needs to monitor various functions of the turbine
for performance, safety, sequencing, and troubleshooting. The
microprocessor-based PLC works with the new analog input/output modules to
perform such functions as:
-- Sequencing turbine and auxiliaries.
-- Controlling turbine during startup, loading, and shutdown.
-- Protecting turbine from abnormal internal or external conditions.
-- Monitoring and displaying analog and status outputs.
-- Responding to operator commands.
   Among the options the PLC offers are condition and trend monitoring,
predictive trending, comparative strip charts, and turbine and compressor
performance maps.
   With analog components, savings in inventory and spare parts are
possible. To accomplish this, transmitters are calibrated for a specific
range; PLC software is changed for specific setpoints required for the
application. There's no need to stock a wide variety of pressure switches
with different setpoints for different applications and conditions.--Ametek
Inc, PMT Div.

DETECT HOT SPOTS IN AIR HEATERS BEFORE FIRE OCCURS

By:
Steven Collins


The buildup of combustibles on air-heater elements can lead to disaster.
When enough heat and excess air are available, the deposits undergo
spontaneous oxidation--causing the temperature to rise higher. Once it goes
above 400F, ignition can occur, creating a "hot spot." Left alone, such
areas may grow hot enough for the thin metal elements themselves to
ignite--an extremely dangerous situation.
   Ordinarily, thermocouples are placed at the gas-outlet side of air
heaters to detect fires. However, this method only detects a fire after it
has started and may not be accurate when there is little or no flue-gas
flow through the heater--such as when a unit is put into the hot standby
condition--because it relies on the convective transfer of heat to
thermocouples.
   An infrared heat-detection system, recently developed and tested in
Japan, reportedly has several advantages over the conventional method of
air-heater fire detection, including: (1) Hot spots are detected before a
fire starts, (2) element temperature monitoring is accurate at all times,
regardless of gas flow rate, (3) location and temperature of hot spots can
be depicted graphically on control-room CRT screens, and (4) the system can
be calibrated automatically in-place using a standard heat source.
   The system is a joint development of Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Tokyo, Japan. It was tested at Tepco's
265-MW Yokosuka Unit 1, which includes a combination coal/oil-fired boiler
with a rotating regenerative air heater (figure, above).
   To enhance long-term reliability, the system is located in the air-inlet
section of the air heater where temperatures are relatively low and the
environment is free of dust and corrosive elements found in the flue-gas
stream. The actual infrared sensor itself is located outsideof the heater.
   Here's how the system works: A track-mounted mirror travels back and
forth, scanning the plane of the rotating air heater. When a hot spot
occurs, the infrared rays it emits are reflected by the mirror at a 90-deg
angle into the sensing unit. A local control panel converts the infrared
intensity to a scaled temperature signal and measures the position of the
mirror on its track and the air heater in its rotational path. These data
are then transmitted to the plant's main monitoring system, which sounds an
alarm. Operators can view the exact position and intensity of the hot
spot--represented by color spectrum--on a CRT screen. This visual imaging
system makes it easy to monitor growth of the hot spots and the
effectiveness of preventive or extinguishing measures--such as cutting air
flow, flooding with CO subscript 2, etc.
   During 14 months of testing at Yokosuka, the unit is reported to have
operated without any notable problems. In the event that dust deposits in
the area of the mirror--one consequence of co-firing coal and oil--it is
easily removed by a small air-jet system.

CUT SCRUBBER O&M COSTS BY ACID-CLEANING FILTER SCREENS

By:
Steven Collins

Charles Hoop, Columbus Southern Power Co, devised a simple and inexpensive
method for cleaning grit and particles from FGD slurry separator screens at
the Conesville (Ohio) station. In less than four hours, the FGD system's
4-ft-diameter stainless steel screens are returned to "like-new" condition
by soaking them in a trough containing a muriatic acid solution (photos,
preceding page).
   Before the soaking method was implemented, the plant's four screens
required replacement every two weeks at a cost of $400/screen. According to
Hoop, the screens have thus far required no replacement. The 28 cleanings
performed each year require 110 hours, or about $2200 worth of labor.
Replacing the screens cost $11,200/yr plus labor. Thus, the plant saves
about $9000 annually by cleaning screens rather than replacing them.

USE MODEL PLANE TO RECORD STACK CONDITIONS

By:
Steven Collins

While serving as a shift foreman at a utility generating station in
Illinois, C G Vernon came up with a "topflight" solution to recording wind
and temperature data near the outlet of the plant's stacks. Researchers
needed the data to check if emissions were being adequately dispersed and
to substantiate future stack designs.
   Because the stacks are several hundred feet tall, researchers first
considered using a helicopter. However, this alternative was deemed too
risky and expensive. Eventually, the necessary equipment was carried up
above the stacks by large balloons. These were difficult to control. One
broke free of its anchor line and came down in a nearby lake.
   The research team next considered hiring a private plane, but soon found
out that none could fly low enough or slow enough. Just when the team was
about to abandon the project, Vernon--whose son was a model plane
fanatic--suggested that a remote-controlled plane be used. The research
team quickly found a model plane large enough to carry the payload of
monitoring instruments. Soon after, the "mini research plane" was
successfully maneuvered up above the stacks, collected the data, and
returned safely to ground.

CALCULATE LOSSES CAUSED BY STEAM LEAKS

By:
Steven Collins

Did you ever wonder how much energy --and money--is wasted because of steam
leaks at your plant? The next time you come across one, use the following
example to estimate losses:
   Assume that a steam trap having a 1/4-in. orifice leaks 100-psig steam
72 hr/week.
   -- Look up energy loss per thousand hours of leakage in the table
below.
   -- Annual energy loss (AEL)
AEL = 72 x 52 x 240-million Btu divided by 1000 hr = 864-million Btu/yr
  -- Annual dollar loss (ADL)
ADL = 864 divided by (1.03-million Btu divided by 1000 ft superscript 3)
x (0.65) x ($2 divided by 1000 ft superscript 3) = $2581

COOK ZEBRA MUSSELS BY RECIRCULATING COOLING WATER

By:
Steven Collins

By recirculating condenser cooling water, engineers at a Commonwealth
Edison Co fossil-fired plant were able to double the temperature in the
cooling circuit. Six hours of this treatment killed approximately 75% of
the mussels that were blocking the cooling-water filter screens. The
utility estimates that two such treatments each year can prevent zebra
mussels from posing any problems to operations.

FLOW MODIFIER UPS EFFICIENCY OF GAS-FIRED BOILERS

By:
Steven Collins

Users of packaged boilers and other gas-fired process vessels have reported
significant efficiency increases after installing an in-line device that
changes fuel gas flow from laminar to turbulent (figure, above). These
"turbulators" increase gas temperature closer to the point of combustion by
causing fuel particles to impact each other--and the walls of the supply
pipe-- with greater frequency and force. More important, turbulent flow
results in rapid and complete combustion by ensuring better mixing of gas
and air when the fuel reaches the burner.
   One company, Leader Energy Industries Inc, Chicago, Ill, manufactures
stainless steel turbulators, which reportedly have improved the fuel
efficiency of industrial heating boilers by up to 10% (photo, below). The
device has a more dramatic impact when installed in low-pressure gas-supply
systems--below 20 psig--because high-pressure systems inherently impart
turbulent flow. However, improvements have been documented at higher
pressure levels as well.
   When Duncan Boiler Service Inc, Kenner, La, installed a turbulator in
the 120-psig gas supply line of an 800-hp heating boiler, the device raised
full-load efficiency by over 3%. Improved fuel/air mixing allowed smoother
combustion and reduced the required excess O2 by 27%. As a result,
NO subscript x emissions dropped from 58 ppm to 35 ppm.

HOW SHOULD WE PLAN FOR REPAIRS AFTER FIRE OR STORM?

By:
William O'Keefe

A paper mill near our plant recently had a fire on its turbine floor, with
considerable damage done. I was hired by the management to help with the
repair and return to service of the equipment. The mill management, besides
calling in manufacturers of the major components to assess damage and make
repairs, did much of the work on small equipment and piping. Although the
fire was totally unexpected, starting from electrical troubles, it seemed
to me that the plant lost much time at the start of rehabilitation by not
having any idea of how to proceed. There was no coordinated effort or
guidelines on major decisions. Individual tasks were assigned with no more
than a command to get back on line as fast as possible.
   The effort would have been much more efficient if at least the outline
of a plan of action had been in existence beforehand. This would apply to
many other large-scale interruptions, too, such as floods or storms.
   What experience have Power readers had with preparation of contingency
or disaster plans for steam and electric-power facilities? Have the readers
developed any criteria for evaluating damage and repair-vs-scrap
decisions?--OSR, September Power

SOLUTIONS

Documentation is the first need
In a recent fire restoration in which I was involved, proper documentation
was critical to a quick completion. Lack of available, up-to-date
documentation could have been a problem. Unlimited quantities of repair
personnel, equipment, and supplies will do no good until the engineering
staff figures out what has to be done.
   In our case, we had about 80% of the necessary information within one
day. While the equipment covered by the 80% was being repaired, we had time
to conduct a walkdown and to figure out the other 20% that was
undocumented. All those who are in favor of undocumented modifications or
additions based on sketches tucked away in a file cabinet, take heed--the
upfront time and money saved can be lost several times over.
J Dage, Detroit, Mich

Pre-disaster photos can be vital
One help in restoring conditions is a file of photos taken generally
throughout the plant within, say, a year before the catastrophe. The
photography doesn't have to be studio quality, either. A shot taken from a
vantage point and relating the locations of components to each other and to
any piping, electrical ducts, etc, will prove helpful even if drawings are
available. There will always be add-ons that don't show on any drawing.
Some of the added features may have been very expensive in time and money,
and reconstituting them from memory can be costly. Guards and safety
railing are examples of this.
   Two cautions on photographing the plant:
   -- Keep the photos at a distance from the plant site, so that they will
survive.
   -- Make sure that repeat photography is done at least annually, on a set
date if possible.
   With new high-speed film, even a mid-price camera can get adequate shots
in most plant areas without the trouble of special lighting. Record on the
back of each photo the point from which it was taken, so that the next
year's series can at least start from what were found effective vantage
points in the past.
R J Allison, Sacramento, Calif

First, know the inventory
Of primary importance is an equipment and inventory list which includes
purchase price and date, or current price. The list should cover all
capital costs and assets in the powerplant.
   To evaluate damage, an assessment program by category or discipline of
work--such as mechanical, electrical, instruments and controls, or
civil--should include the following:
   -- Scope of damage.
   -- Labor and material estimate for repair.
   -- Labor and material estimate for replacement.
   -- Age of equipment.
   -- Decision on whether system improvement or upgrade is involved.
   -- Availability of replacement machinery or components.
   Remember to assign a unique sequential-number system for each damage
assessment. Once the plant has finished the damage assessment, categorize
as complete loss, partial loss, or no disaster-related loss. This can be a
percent of replacement cost.
   Accurate and prompt damage assessment is critical. It will make easier
the determination of repair vs scrap status and let cleanup work begin.
Damage assessment will prove valuable even for systems or equipment
adjudged to be a total loss.
   A complete schedule for the work is next. It will give organization,
added cost considerations, and a target for completion of work in timely
manner.
   Repair and replacement work can begin with engineering, contractors,
procurement, invoices, work orders, man-hour records, and all
disaster-repair-related cost-tracking referenced to the appropriate
damage-assessment document number. In many cases, an accounting cost code
system may be desirable for an additional method of
cost-accumulation-summary reporting. As costs accrue, up to the final
resolution, the damage assessment evaluation serves for categorizing the
work.
R Webster, Charlotte, NC

It's an established science now
About 20 years ago, "hazard, fault, and failure analysis" turned into a
formal scientific method of investigating potential problems in the space
program, aircraft manufacture, chemical-processing industries, and several
engineering systems. Simply stated, the method applies analytical
procedures to any system or part of it to find the potential for damage of
physical facilities, the downtime costs, and the lost-production charges.
This method has been developed in-house by many companies and various
government agencies. It is usually taught by a practitioner trained by the
employer and having experience in the field.
   Applying the above-described analysis to the paper mill (considering it
as a failure) would have allowed management to have established procedures
for cleanup, repairs, replacements, and general rehabilitation methods in
advance. Obviously this was not done, as OSR observes. The early efforts
after the mill fire seem to have resembled the oldnavy axiom: "When in
danger or doubt, run in circles, scream, and shout." From my experience, it
is possible not only to analyze potentials for catastrophe at various
levels, but also to find ways to reduce the happenings.
   Damage evaluations and repair-vs-scrap decision criteria are on-the-spot
functions, to be made by the best plant- engineering personnel at the
scene. This includes selection of experienced plant millwright crews.
B B Brown, Greencastle, Pa

Beware of the asbestos threat
One aspect of the rebuilding effort that doesn't draw much attention but
which is looming larger as time goes on is the problem of asbestos
insulation. Many older plants have buildings, components, and piping
insulated with asbestos-containing materials. Although neglect or even
encapsulation may have led to a false sense of security, when a major
disaster hits, there is likely to be considerable loose asbestos on-site,
already released or to be released during repairs.
   Many environmental agencies are now more aware than ever of the
possibilities of health hazards from asbestos released during natural
disasters of the kind that OSR mentions. the disaster itself is bound to
attract attention of the regulatory agencies, and inspectors are very
likely to be on the scene even before the cleanup crews arrive.
   Any disaster program to restore a plant to service has got to take this
into account. Precautions will be necessary during removal of asbestos to
the point where crews can begin work on the major items of plant and
equipment. Any plant preparing plans for recovery from disaster should be
cognizant of what the asbestos situation is now and could be in case of a
disaster.
G V Arcano, Milwaukee, Wis

Don't rush into restoration
OSR is right in thinking that planning ahead of time is crucial for major
events in a plant. From my experience, I can add that over-hasty return to
service can be the start of a long period of trouble.
   In our case, a flood accompanied by a medium-size fire left us with
water-soaked components,fire damage, and a management that wanted instant
return to generation. We didn't realize the hidden damage from sand, silt,
and water when we rushed through perfunctory cleanups and got back on line
as soon as equipment could operate within temperature and vibration
tolerances.
   After about four months, however, we began to pay the price, with damage
to journals, dielectric failures, gasket leaks, and accelerated corrosion.
I never found out exactly what our accelerated and highly praised recovery
effort cost us, but I am sure that the shortcuts were a disaster of their
own.
R A Masniak, Ft Lauderdale, Fla

Your January problem
What's the best way to plan run time of redundant equipment?

Recently, I have been faced with the question of how to handle the run time
of redundant equipment at a generating station. When planning for maximum
availability at acceptable cost, I have wondered what the recommended
procedure is for trading-off standby equipment. Opinions on the advantages
and disadvantages of maintaining equal total-run time vs either staggered
total-run time or a full-time lead and standby situation seem to vary.
   What experience have Power readers had with improving availability by
careful planning of run time for redundant components--such as pumps, fans,
and even turbines or auxiliary drives? Once a total-run-time policy is
established, to what lengths should we go to track total run time to
equipment preventive-maintenance (PM) times or to failure? Have readers had
trouble with excessive running of standby equipment which may not be as new
or equal in quality to firstline equipment? And what is the best way to
keep records on this?--MPC

SETBACK FOR JAPAN'S N-PROGRAMME AFTER MONJU ACCIDENT

Japan's nuclear power programme, the most ambitious in the world, is
facing major repercussions following a major accident at the site of
the country's 280 MW Monju fast-breeder experimental reactor.

While the accident itself was severe - involving the leakage of sodium-
based coolant - and could have led to a near catastrophic series of
events, what is more worrisome was the slow reaction of the operators
and of other officials associated with the FBR programme.

Their subsequent efforts to `cover up' many details of the accident,
which involved the reactor's secondary coolant system, has led the
Japanese news media, the Fukui prefectural government and others to
engage in bitter criticism of the way the national government handles
its comprehensive nuclear energy policy.

For example, Yasuoki Urano, director-general of the Science and
Technology Agency (STA), said he was extremely angry about false
reports given by Monju's operator.

The coverup involved withholding segments of video footage showing the
extensive damage to pipe structures caused by leakage of the sodium
coolant, which itself was the result of an apparent faulty pipe weld.

Located in Tsuruga, Fukui prefecture, Monju is the heart of a
controversy over Japan's use of plutonium and the government's step-by-
step development scheme focusing on eventual construction and use of
commercial fast-breeder reactors.

Indeed, Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, said in a
December 24 editorial: "Outrage and concern over the handling of the
attempted cover up are brought to light. Unless `Donen' (the operator)
changes, it cannot be entrusted with nuclear development in which
safety is most crucial."

The Yomiuri Shimbun is well-known as an advocate of further development
of nuclear power projects, unlike some other Japanese newspapers, so an
editorial on its pages is to be seen as particularly damaging to the
programme.

Because Monju is fuelled by plutonium, the leakage of about three
tonnes of sodium-compound coolant on December 8 could have been much
more severe. The daily coverage in the media in Japan of the accident's
severity (which was only made known in bits and pieces), the falsifying
of details, and the slow response of officials to admit problems, may
in turn result in a drastic re-examination of Japan's policies vis-a-
vis the use of plutonium.

The country had planned to start utilising some plutonium in the form
of mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) in as many as 10 BWRs and PWRs by around 2000-
2002. This is viewed as an effective way to use up some plutonium, so
as to prevent Japan from having an excess amount in storage - which
would make neighbouring countries nervous.

But that plan, which is overseen by the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI), could be delayed considerably because of fresh
concerns over safety.

There are implications too for the long-term nuclear programme. The
Institute of Energy Economics predicts that Japan should have 75-90 GW
of nuclear power by 2020 and 90 GW-110 GW by 2030. This estimate,
regarded as phenomenal in most nuclear circles, stems from a recent
projection study funded by the STA.

At present, Japan has 39.6 GW of nuclear capacity in 50 operating
reactors with another four under construction or near commissioning.
There are already problem of where to site new reactors.  Also
troublesome is the history of Monju with construction delays, cost
overruns, postponements in starting operations due to equipment
problems, and assorted other headaches.

Last March, a problem with a steam control device was found, and in
June a software-related problem cropped up. Monju had been generating
power since late August, and it had been scheduled to begin full power
tests at the end of the year.

The Nuclear Safety Commission, an independent entity affiliated with
the Science and Technology Agency, is now investigating the accident
and the series of events following the detection of the sodium compound
leak.  On the day of the accident, it took eight minutes for the head
operator of the Monju to get in contact with the "division chief" to
ask permission to shut down the plant, which was operating at about 40%
of output.

The Leakage was detected at 7:47 p.m. on December 8 and the shutdown
did not start until 8 p.m. Late last month, after this detail came to
light, Hiroshi Oishi, head of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel
Development Corp (PNC), admitted that the delay in shutting down the
reactor - due to the intricate chain of command hierarchy - was,
indeed, a problem. Oishi also admitted that this delay was itself among
the contributing causes to the lag in reporting the accident to the
local municipality.

Meanwhile, the Fukui prefectural government has issued a report late
last month that prohibits Monju from being restarted.without strict
guarantees that accident safeguards are fully implemented by the PNC.
These safeguards focus mainly on leak detection systems and emergency
procedures. That report came out about the same time that the STA
revised a report on the accident.

The STA had to get the PNC to revise the report because PNC's initial
version contained falsified data. Included in the corrections was a
revised time of the first inspection of the accident site (7 a.m.,
December 9) rather than the earlier stated time (10 p.m. the night
before). PNC dismissed four officials associated with Monju, including
one of the directors in charge of operations. "Dismissed" means they
will still be employed by PNC, though at other sites.

Fukui governor Yukio Kurita went so far as to say that the citizens of
Fukui feel "betrayed because of PNC's deceptions." Fukui prefecture has
a total of 15 nuclear reactors, most of which are operated by Osaka-
based Kansai Electric Power Co.

MITI Vice-Minister Tomio Tsutsumi said that MITI was instructing all
power utilities to enhance their training of operators and inspection
processes as well as speed up reporting of accidents to relevant
authorities. His comments were made in direct response to the Monju
accident.

Monju is slated to serve as the technical foundation for a `pre-
commercial' or `demonstration' FBR, which would be followed by
commercial FBRs, according to the government's long-term nuclear energy
development plan. However, critics contend that the post-Monju plant
will be exceedingly expensive and that electric power utilities are not
interested in building and operating commercial FBRs until sometime
after 2030. The Monju accident will definitely have an impact on this
schedule.

It could also create extensive hardships for planners seeking to find a
construction site for the post-Monju reactor. MITI's Agency of Natural
Resources and Energy (ANRE) and other government groups will do their
best to secure such a site, which requires local approval. But in the
wake of the Monju accident that will be a significant challenge.

Additionally, the accident will affect the outlook on the nuclear fuel
reprocessing facility now under construction at Rokkasho-mura, Aomori
prefecture. The planned measures to ensure the safety of that plant,
which will handle spent fuel and plutonium, will likely have to be
enhanced. And that plant will be subject to greater oversight from
local authorities fearing the possibility of the whitewashing similar
to that occurring after Monju's sodium leakage. Aomori has sent
officials to Fukui to investigate first hand the accident and the
subsequent cover up.

Because the Federation of Electric Power Companies (FERC) decided in
July 1995 to cancel the government-led project to construct a plutonium-
burning advanced thermal reactor (ATR) in Aomori prefecture, mainly due
to escalating cost projections, the FBR programme itself may be subject
to greater cost-related scrutiny and other kinds of analysis. Expanding
pressure on utilities to reduce costs - so as to slash rate structures
- is causing power utility executives to look more closely at all areas
where cost-cutting rationalisation can be applied.

One serious after-effect of the Monju accident is that the Fukui
prefectural government has stated that it will delay making a decision
to allow Japan Atomic Power Co. to build two more reactors in the
Tsuruga area. And, as for the time that will be needed to repair
Monju's equipment, some estimates are in the range of two years, if
extensive redesign work is required.

COMPANIES TURN UP HEAT FOR 3 GORGES FUNDING

Western companies are starting to turn up the heat on their development
agencies to ensure they do not miss out on the a piece of the action in
the world's biggest hydroelectric project at Three Gorges on China's
Yangtze River.

The focal point is in the US where it had been understood, unofficially
at least, that US companies could not count on any support from the
Export-Import Bank in their efforts to win power equipment deals at the
high dam project deep in central China, 1,500 km from Shanghai. This
stemmed largely from the Clinton Administration's long dispute with
China over human rights abuses and the more pertinent issue of the
massive dislocation of people affected by the construction of the
17,500 MW-plus complex and the creation of a huge reservoir downriver
from Chongqing.

It is predicted that well over 1m people will be dislocated by the
project, and it is not thought that Beijing will overly concern itself
with how smooth this exodus will be. The estimated value of the project
is now becoming stratospheric and has been put at around $24bn. The
project, in totality,  could be completed by 2009, but is likely to be
finished sometime in the second decade. First power would come on line
early in the next century.

Recent developments suggest that the Eximbank is now yielding to
congressional and private sector lobby pressure to do what it is
supposed to do - back US exports. It became known recently that a
National Security Council interagency committee had concluded that US
government finance should not be made available to such a controversial
project.

However, the caution to Exim by the administration was carefully
worded. In a letter last September from Samuel Berger, deputy assistant
to the president for national security, the NSC said it would be
"unwise" for the government (of which Exim is an agency) should align
itself with the scheme because of environmental and human rights
concerns and should note the legal problems that might arise from any
decision to provide assistance. But also the government should
"refrain" from publicly condemning the project. "Such a condemnation
would unduly strain bilateral relations." In conclusion, the government
should take a low profile on the Three Gorges project for fear of
harming other US trade and investment interests in China.

The reference to  legal problems appears connected with threats by many
environmental agencies contemplating court action against Exim should
it change its mind.

This will pose a major challenge for Martin Kamark, a Washington
lawyer, named last week to succeed Kenneth Brody as chairman of the
institution. Kamarck's wife, Elaine, is a senior policy advisor to vice-
president Al Gore, which suggests he will be under pressure to tow the
Administration's line rather than that of private sector interests.

Nevertheless, as he prepared for his new position - he is already vice-
chairman - news reports last week from the US indicated that the White
House is putting some distance between itself from its earlier advice
to Exim to stay away from Three Gorges. American companies such as
Caterpillar, Rotec and Voith Hydro have applied for $500m in loans from
Exim. General Electric made clear two years ago that it would
aggressively pursue opportunities to cash in on the project's
requirements for up to 16 foreign-manufactured turbine generators for
the dam's power houses.

The concerns of US industry are real enough for it is mainly the US -
and until a year or so ago Canada - that has allowed itself to moralise
about the project. No such worries as yet bedevil the British, French,
German or Japanese governments, whose companies are now positioning
themselves to chase for business, either through direct negotiation or
in competitive tender. China is still thought to be the big
infrastructure order-book prize in Asia, despite its  inarticulate
foreign investment policies, which are still undergoing revisions.

Analysts do concede, however, that the attempted use of foreign aid by
other countries to support Three Gorges - at least in its early stages
- will arouse similar controversy because of the strength of the
international environmental lobby. The British government was badly
burned by the use of concessional finance to back the Malaysian Pergau
Dam scheme; and the Japanese foot-dragged on supporting the World
Bank's now-aborted backing for the Nepal Arun III project.

US companies have noted Canada's `Damascene' conversion to the the
project. When in opposition, Jean Chretien's Liberal Party condemned
the Tory government's support for Three Gorges, but when in power, it
changed its tune - most notably in November 1993 when Chretien, now
Prime Minister, visited China. Said one observer, "He saw the future,
and it was wet."

Chretien has since given the Canadian Export Development Corp.,
Canada's version of the US Exim Bank, the green light to provide export
credits to back Canadian involvement in Three Gorges. Some of the major
regional utilities, full of hydropower expertise but sensitive to the
resettlement issue, are on record as eschewing support for the scheme,
such as BC Hydro and Ontario Hydro. Indeed, BCH's ex-chief executive,
Maurice Strong, is an environmentalist and is now an adviser to the
World Bank's new president James Wolfensohn.

Significantly,  last year Monenco Agra, an engineering consultant, won
a $34.5m contract to provide a computer system to co-ordinate the
Three Gorges resettlement. EDC support of $12.5m has since been
mobilised; indeed, the EDC had already provided $23.5m in finance and
cover to help Dominion Bridge build a cement plant in China, whose
output will be used on the dam.

The existence of a Canadian option is seen as a benefit to those US
companies - of which there are many - with subsidiaries in Canada.
Rotec has indicated it might look to the EDC if Exim backing is not
available.

Solid opposition to the scheme still lies with the environmental
groups. Probe International in Canada has taken some relish at
lampooning Chretien's volte face on the issue. In the US, Human Rights
Watch/Asia has attacked the Beijing government for its suppression of
open debate or, indeed, any criticism of the project.

It reinforced this with publication of  report detailing a devastating
account of two Chinese dam collapses in August 1975, which took the
lives of at least 85,000 and possibly as many as 230,000, but news of
which was hushed up by the government. US International Rivers Network
has added its weight to the chorus of disapproval for the scheme.

Further critiques in the past few years have come in the form of two
publications, Yangtze! Yangtze! by Dai Qing; and Damming the Three
Gorges, edited by Margaret Barber and Grainne Ryder and issued by
Toronto-based Probe.

Among the multilateral aid agencies, the lobby groups appear to have
had success in garnering fairly cohesive  support for their anti-Three
Gorges stance. The World Bank last year took the circumspect view that,
as it had not been asked by China, it could not support Three Gorges.
Under its new president, James Wolfensohn, who is pushing the Bank to
demand greater accountability and signs of commerciality among borrower
nations, this policy towards Three Gorges is now: `if asked, the answer
is no.' Wolfensohn, it should be noted, is a close friend of President
Clinton.

The Bank's view is shared by the Asian Development Bank. Both the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank (See ADB feature this issue) feel
they are putting plenty of money into China for power projects - some
of them hydro - without getting involved in anything so pregnant with
controversy.

But much schizophrenia still attends the scheme.

In a recent article in Foreign Affairs, the authoritative US bimonthly
publication, writer Audrey Topping noted:

"Estimates of the project's cost range between $17.3bn and $30bn. To
help defray this, the government has been seeking $8bn in foreign
investment. The World Bank, after overseeing a four-year, $8.7m
feasibility study conducted (in the 1980s) by the Canadian
International Development Agency, refused to help with funding.

"Merrill Lynch and other potential investors have also withdrawn
because of the financial and political risks, as well as questions of
human rights violations."

In Hong Kong, Merrill's Robert Graves, senior vice-president for
marketing and communications, last week told Power in Asia: "Merrill
Lynch has never been mandated to work on behalf of or for the Chinese
government regarding the Three Gorges Dam project, nor has any other
foreign bank as far as I know. There have been a lot of rumours in the
past that we were involved, but we never have been approached."

This does not tally with the fact that in 1993 Merrill Lynch,
describing itself as a leading international financial intermediary for
China, published a sponsored statement in the western media providing a
balanced analysis of Three Gorges, explaining the dam's irrigation,
agricultural and power generation benefits while explaining the scope
of the relocation and rehabilitation problem. Said the article:

"Financing for the project, officially estimated at $10bn, will come
from worldwide sources. Merrill Lynch has been working with the Beijing
government to develop the financing plan, which could include bond
offerings.

"Equity financing could account for as much as 50% of the financing in
the early construction stages, and there is also likely to be a
significant amount of strategic partnership investment from
international sources. . . ."

Whatever Merrill's involvement in Three Gorges is, or was, the fact
remain that the project is now  beginning to gear up.

In recent weeks, Shi Dazhen, China's Power Industry Minister, announced
plans for the creation of a nationwide power grid, which could treble
current capacity. This grid was being planned around Three Gorges, and
is aimed at integrating regional and provincial power grids.

Speaking at the annual conference of the country's power industry, Shi
said that the capacity of installed generators, which is now nearly 210
GW, should rise to 300 GW by 2000 and 550 GW-600 GW by 2010, a
breathtaking scenario.

Even more important was the need to boost output. By 2000, he said,
output will have risen to 1.4 trillion kWh, up from 1 trillion kWh in
1995. A total of 170,000 km of power lines capable of handling 220 kV
of power and more will have been installed by then.

Three Gorges will be a centrepiece of the expansion programme. A high
voltage power transmission system will carry power generated by Three
Gorges to other parts of the country. A new company will be set up to
carry out the task.

Added to this will be a nationwide power network to link the grids in
the central and eastern parts of Sichuan province, followed by other
provinces and autonomous regions. Further, a total of 19 major
hydropower schemes and six pumped storage plants will be constructed in
the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and three other rivers.

This all-embracing plan also calls for power grids in 35 key cities to
be rehabilitated and for coal-fired and hydropower generators to be
renovated, and increased use of less toxic fuels such as liquified coal
or gas.

In Beijing last month, China Securities, a business publication, called
on China to issue bonds in overseas markets to meet a shortfall in
funds for the project. They should then use the hard currency raised to
fill part of an expected Yn50bn shortfall. The article said that China
could provide only Yn200bn of the estimated Yn250bn ($30bn).

According to observers in Hong Kong, there are increasing signs that
China is paying attention to international opinion. "They have to if
they want any really helpful foreign finance, be it commercial lending
or export credits," said one banker.  In addition, officials from the
Three Gorges Development Group explained that China planned to set up a
life insurance company to provide policies to those being resettled.

The officials said that an application had been sent to the central
bank, with an approval expected by 1996. The so-called Three Gorges
Life Insurance Co, will be headquartered in Beijing with offices
located closer to the site.

BLACKOUTS HAMMER INDIA'S ECONOMIC OUTPUT

India is reeling under one of the worst onslaughts of power shortages
in living in memory. The current crisis is reaching national
proportions and has been mounting in intensity for about three months.

According to power officials, the source of the problems stems from the
country's failure to reach its power project installation targets,
inadequate rainfall hampering hydropower generation, continued coal
shortages for a variety of reasons and what has been described as
`inter-grid indiscipline.'  The government in the southern state of
Andhra Pradesh has recently increased power cuts to high tension
industrial customers to between 40% and 60% of their sanctioned loads
above 70 kVa. Restrictions on peak hour consumption for industrial
consumers and five-hour supply cuts daily for household consumers are
facets of the acute power crisis in the state.

According to officials, there is a ban on power consumption for booking
or water heating in houses and on the use of neon signs at shops and on
billboards. Street lighting is even being restricted to alternate
poles.

The curtailment has come just at the end of an earlier power
restriction regime, eased briefly with the belated arrival of monsoon
rains which boosted reservoir levels.

The problem in AP state, however, is being greeted with widespread
scepticism, particularly by business consumers who believe the
government is protecting  the agricultural community at their expense.
The rationale is that the rural vote is too delicate to be tampered
with by the Telgu Desam Party, particularly in an election year.
Therefore urban customers are being made to bear the lion's share of
the power cut regime.

For example, the government is maintaining a certain minimum level of
water in Srisailam reservoir for release to the newly constructed Telgu
Ganga canal system to provide irrigation facilities for the farmers in
the Rayalaseema region. This has resulted in the closure of the
Srisailam hydropower station and the loss of 770 MW of capacity.

Indeed, it is to maintain the promised daily nine hours power supply
for irrigation pumpsets that other consumers are having to take it on
the chin. AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu explained to the
legislative assembly that only 4,295 MW power was available in December
against peak demand of 5,219 MW.

In neighbouring Karnataka state, a 50% cut for high tension consumers
and the 30% cut in supply for all low tension commercial, industrial
and non-industrial consumers since late October has led to a power
supply crisis never seen before, say officials.

One stop-gap is a proposal for three barge-mounted generating units
with a total of 400 MW of capacity, which could be delivered within six
months of the issue of letters of intent. If the deal goes through, it
will be some kind of record in a country renowned for its bureaucracy
and slow approvals system - one of the reasons for the power crisis.

Karnataka's problem is that it is 65% reliant on hydropower; this
year's monsoon has been late, leaving Linganamakki, Supta and Mani dam
reservoirs half empty. In Kerala state, the fast depletion of hydro
reservoirs is prompting a similar requirement for belt-tightening.

AP and Karnataka states are also suffering from a long strike by a
majority of workers in the Singareni Colliers Co. (SCCL) coal mines,
which has been going on since mid-October.

The virtual halt of coal supplies from the SCCL mines in AP has hit the
Ramagundam power station operated by the National Thermal Power Corp
(2,000 MW) and Karnataka's only coal-fired unit at Raichur. Generation
dropped to just 600 MW at Ramagundam as daily coal supplies went down
to 20,000 tonnes against 35,000 tonnes normally required.  The NTPC is
being persuaded to pay in advance for the coal in order to generate
between Rs400m-Rs450m required to meet the wage arrears of the striking
workers of the financially-troubled SCCL.

Coal problems are also hitting APSEB. The state utility has called for
offers for 500,000t of imported coal, but has delayed an actual order
placement. The imported coal will cost about Rs2,900 per tonne, very
expensive compared with the Rs700-Rs800 per tonne for domestic coal.
Financially the board is unable to pick up the estimated Rs1.50bn
($42m) bill for the imported coal. The transmission constraints stand
in the way of wheeling surplus power from the eastern region.

The coal authorities, as in the past, hardly admit any supply shortages
by its enterprises, despite the outcry but its customers. Two 250 MW
units at Dahanu power station, operated by the private sector BSES
Ltd., are operating much below capacity due to low supplies from
domestic mines controlled by government enterprises.

But Coal Minister Jagdish Tyler explained to the parliament last month
that the coal companies had supplied 115.8mt of coal to the power
stations in the April-November period, achieving 99.45% of the target.

The reason, then, for the low stocks at the power stations could be
excess consumption of coal by them, constraints in unloading coal from
railway wagons at the power houses and constraints in the movement of
coal. not to mention the perennial problem of non-delivery because of
non-payment of bills by power generators.

As for transmission problems, three major grid disturbances in the
western region in the past few months have led to blackouts and have
prompted much doubting about whether the region is any better off than
other regions of the country. More rude shocks are expected.

For example,  R. Chandramuli, Tata Electric Companies V-P, has warned
that the Bombay metropolis is facing a virtual grid collapse on a daily
basis. Bombay is accustomed to uninterrupted power supplies but
supplies were hit on December 9.

N.A. Joshi, Maharashtra State Electricity Board member/technical,
thinks the state will have power shortages and breakdowns until a new
500 MW unit at Chandrapur goes on line in mid-1997. With peak demand at
8,300 MW and availability at 7,700 MW, the state is at present
witnessing about 600 MW shortage.

At the same time, the perpetual overdraw by the Madhya Pradesh state by
200 MW-500 MW from central power stations at Korba and Vindhyachal has
deepened the shortages in Maharashtra.

This is an example of grid indiscipline, and has led to a dip in the
minimum level of frequency of power resulting in tripping of power
generating stations all over the region.

Factories in Gujarat in northwest India have recorded up to 80
trippings a month since the end of summer. Even continuous process
industries in the state are reeling under a 25% cut in power supply.

"These cuts and supply shortfall will undermine our efforts to make
Gujarat the premier state in the country for industrial investment,"
rues Grish Dani, the president of the Gujarat chamber of commerce, in
reference to some 20% investment injection attracted by the state since
1991. The current shortfall has been estimated by industrialists at
1,500 MW.

ADB NEPAL DEAL SETS OUT POWER PRIORITIES

A $125m loan that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was due to approve
in 1997 for a hydro project in Kali Gandaki, Nepal, will now be brought
before ADB's board this year, Arun Adarkar, Director of ADB's recently
inaugurated North American Office told Power in Asia in the course of
an interview.

The decision to "accelerate" the Kali Gandaki project was taken because
of Nepal's "new circumstances", explains Adarkar - notably, last year's
cancellation of Nepal's biggest ever hydro scheme - the 210 MW Arun III
run-of-river scheme - when the World Bank withdrew its $175m support
for the scheme.

Adarkar, an Indian national, who was ADB secretary in Manila from 1985-
1991, and a senior advisor in the Southeast Asia and Pacific Department
of the International Monetary Fund before assuming his present post in
Washington DC in May, denies that ADB's decision means ADB is taking up
the slack in power lending in Nepal, or indeed, anywhere else in Asia,
because the World Bank is reducing its support for the sector, or, in
the case of Arun III, completely pulling out.

The Kali Gandaki project is not "a replacement" for Arun III, and nor
is it in "the same geographical area", says Adarkar.

Notwithstanding World Bank lending for power in South Asia is
shrinking.  Between 1986 and 1990 such lending averaged $999m a year.
But between 1991-1995 it had almost halved to $474m a year average.

On the other hand, World Bank lending for power in East Asia and the
Pacific - a region that now includes six economies in transition:
Cambodia, China, Laos, Mongolia, Mynamar and Vietnam - is increasing.
World Bank loans for the power sector in this region averaged $662m a
year from 1986 to 1990 but they almost doubled to $1bn a year average
from 1991 to 1995.

As for the ADB at December 31 1994 it had lent a total of $10.2bn for
power generation, distribution and transmission projects, and over $60m
for related technical assistance/advice.  ADB's borrowing countries
comprise the developing countries of South and East Asia and the
Pacific and some of the newly independent states of the former Soviet
Union, such as Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.

Adarkar says ADB's projected lending for energy projects generally (oil
and gas as well as for power) will average $4.8bn a year from January 1
1995 to December 31 1997, which is a big increase compared with ADB's
lending in the sector during the previous three years.  Roughly two-
thirds of this projected lending will be for the power sector.

The ADB Director noted that the biggest borrower by far now and in the
foreseeable future is China, a relatively new ADB client.  ADB loans to
China for power over the 1995-1997 period will total $1.8bn, says
Adarkar.  In second place, comes Indonesia ($787m total projected power
sector lending), followed by the Phillipines ($544m).

The ADB is also just beginning to do business or is renewing business
with many other countries in the region.  For instance loans for power
projects amounting to $100m, $35m and $25m are due to be disbursed to
Mongolia, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic respectively during the
1995-1997 period, while loans to Vietnam to rehabilitate its power
sector are projected to total $140m during the period, ADB only renewed
lending to Vietnam in 1993.

Among ADB's traditional borrowers, Pakistan will continue to be an
important client, says Adarkar, with projected loans for the power
sector between 1995 and 1997 of $300m.

However, India which used to be a big power sector borrower in the
past, now borrows more from ADB for gas.  Total gas sector lending by
ADB to India was $560m in 1993, for instance.  Adarkar reckons, even if
ADB, the World Bank and other development institutions pooled all their
power sector loans for southern and eastern Asia and the Pacific, these
would still not be nearly enough to satisfy the region's massive
estimated $45bn a year sector requirements during the 1990s.

The massive investment needs reflect both specific and general factors.
 Specific failings are that all too often too close a relationship
exists between the functions of power utilities and government in the
region, with the result that the financial management and structuring
of utilities is often not transparent; accounting is inefficient; and
due to unrealistic pricing, and tariffs not matching the real costs of
supply, the utilities' debt servicing is now so onerous that the
utilities cannot go on expanding to meet forecast demand in the 1990s
in the way they did in the 1980s.

Nor can the State bail the utilities out at a time when budget cutting,
controlling inflation and other public investments, for instance in
health and education, are priorities.  As a result, electricity
shortages, power outages and brownouts are common across the region.

Indeed, according to ADB, per capita electricity consumption in Asian
developing countries in now just 500 kWh compared with 6,600 kWh in
OECD countries, and per capita installed capacity is 0.1 KW compared
with 1.9 KW in the OECD.

On top of this, inefficiencies in the generation, delivery and use of
electricity causes serious losses.  Total system losses among ADB
borrowing countries range from 25% to 35% compared with what ADB
considers acceptable loss levels of 15% to 18%.Furthermore, much of the
expansion carried out in the power sector in the 1980s in the region
was done without considering the environmental impact.

The general reasons for the huge capital investment requirements at
least in East Asia are due to under-investment in the past, acute
problem in Vietnam, Laos, Mongolia, Cambodia and the Philippines; rapid
urbanisation (even if the current urban growth rate of 4% a year in the
region slows down more than 1bn people will be living in towns in the
next generation); rising global competition; and dramatically high
economic growth.

East Asia has been the fastest growing region in the world for 25
years.  During the next decade the region is projected to grow at 7% -
8% a year.  One consequence of this huge growth is that the demand for
power has also greatly increased, raising investment requirements.

The need to promote private sector investment is vital.  The gap
between the demand for large-scale financing in the 1990s in the
sector, and what governments and development banks can provide, may
only be bridged by private investment.

So a top priority of ADB's work says Adarkar is helping countries
create the conditions that make private investors participation in the
sector appealing.

The countries ADB lends to are far from homogeneous.  They include
newly industrialised, industrialising, developing and land-locked or
island economies.  Not surprisingly, different nations apply different
sets of reforms in the sector , and are more successful in some areas
than others.

Consider reforms that are indispensable for attracting private
investment in the sector - establishing an appropriate legal and
regulatory framework; putting an end to monopolistic practices by
allowing competition in the generation, transmission and/or
distribution ends of the business; and laying the basis for sound
management in public utilities by restructuring them into autonomous
corporate entities.

Such reforms have been successfully implemented in Malaysia, Indonesia,
Korea, and Thailand in particular, says Adarkar.  In Thailand the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority of Bangkok, and the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) are "models" of government-
owned utilities that are "efficiently managed, enjoy considerable
autonomy, and have a good credit rating", he says.

In many other countries in the region, pending institutional reforms
and/or the privatisation of state-owned power companies, governments
have invited the private sector to invest in independent power projects
often under build-own-transfer (BOT) arrangements.

According to these, the private sponsor finances the building and
operating of power plants while the state-owned public utility
undertakes to buy the electricity under take or pay contracts.

The best example of this approach says the ADB Director, is the
Philippines.  Most electricity distribution was already privately-owned
in the Philippines when the country introduced laws allowing the
private sector to participate in power generation as well as under BOO
and BOT options.

As a result, Japanese, Hong Kong, American and European investors are
currently developing more than 6,000 MW of new generation capacity,
which has relieved Manila of t he daily eight hour brownouts it used to
endure.  Multilateral institutions estimate by 1998 as much as 80% of
national generating capacity could be in private hands in the
Philippines compared to none in 1991.  Meanwhile establishing sound
management in public utilities - essential if the utilities are to
attract private investment - may start with small reforms like selling
a minority of the utilities' stock to the public, (so that they become
more independent from the government), or farming out tasks like
maintenance, and the billing of customers, to the private sector.
Eventually, public utilities need to be allowed to issue bonds and
shares on capital markets to raise long-term finance.

"But most important of all", emphasises the ADB Director," the public
utilities should be allowed to introduce appropriate pricing policies
so that the prices or tariffs they charge reflect the real costs of
supply".  Inappropriate pricing policies for electricity supplies is "a
major problem" among ADB borrowers, Adarkar adds.  "In India, Pakistan
and China, pricing distortions are the  biggest.  Thailand is an
exception".

As for subsidies to the power sector, ADB is pushing borrowers to phase
them out, and to minimise any cross-subsidisation that may exist, of
rural/agricultural consumers by urban/industrial consumers.

A second priority is to make the system work more efficiently by
reducing supply side losses, and encouraging governments to introduce
demand-side management programmes.  The latter is expedient, says
Adarkar.  Studies in the US and Europe conclusively show that it costs
far less to reduce demand by a KW of electricity than it does to add a
KW of generation.

The third power sector priority is making sure the system does not
damage the environment.  For example, ADB has not ever been involved in
the financing of nuclear power plants.  However when it comes to having
a preference for run-of-river over dam-cum reservoir projects, or for
hydro projects over retrofitting of thermal plants to improve the
efficiency of power delivery and reduce pollution, Adarkar says," for
the Bank these options are not contrasting".

"We may do both", he adds.  "It might be necessary in order to expand
capacity to invest in a hydro project.  But at the same time and in the
same country we might help finance retrofitting of a thermal scheme".

All projects financed by ADB are assessed for their environmental
impact and may be redesigned or even discarded if the environmental
impact is found to be too adverse, or cannot be mitigated.  It also
actively encourages borrowers to use clean coal technologies (when
economically viable).

Coal is the primary source of energy in countries that are ADB's
biggest borrowers (eg: China).  And the Bank also provides technical
assistance to countries to help them evaluate the economic
possibilities of developing solar, mini hydro and wind energy options
to meet the demand for electricity in remote/rural areas.

RUSSIAN GROUP LOI FOR TEHRI HYDROPOWER EQUIPMENT

A letter of intent (LOI) has been issued to the Ukrainian-Russian
Energomach consortium for the supply of electro-mechanical equipment
for the phase one segment of the 1,000 MW hydropower project in Uttar
Pradesh.

The deal has an estimated value of Rs3bn ($85.7m), but has been in
limbo for a long time as the Tehri Hydro Development Corp (THDC)
insisted on a performance guarantee from an international bank which
the consortium could not arrange. The corporation now has agreed to
accept the guarantee from the Russian government, and the guarantee
terms are now being drafted.

The consortium includes Russian companies Energomach, Leningrad Metal
Works and Hydro Project Institute, as well as the Ukrainian groups of
Turbatom and Usal Electrotyzamash. The Tehri dam project was to be
funded earlier by the former Soviet Union.

The 4 x 250 MW first phase Tehri project is now scheduled for
completion in 2000 if the THDC does not get entangled in any more
rehabilitation and resettlement (R&R) problems, which have caused
delays.

Time overruns have increased the per-megawatt cost to Rs33m from a mere
Rs330,000 as originally planned in the 1970s. The THDC had announced in
late November a new R&R package for those being uprooted from old Tehri
town by the construction of the dam.

The big increase in compensation for loss of agriculture lands,
financial help in house construction at resettlement sites and cash
incentives for an early shift from the building site by locals are some
of the main features of the project package - and also a reason why the
cost has escalated so precipitately from the 1970s.

Environmental lobbyists opposing the project have been pressing people
to hang on to their lands. The THDC authorities hope all residents of
the town will have shifted to resettlement sites before June, when the
waters brought in by the monsoon rains are impounded by the dam.

A 4 x 250 MW pumped storage plant at Tehri and a 4 x 100 MW hydropower
plant, with a 103 metre high concrete dam at Koteshwar, 22 km
downstream of Tehri, have been planned for the second stage of the
project.

SCHEMES FREED FROM DELHI RED TAPE DELAYS

Power projects with a value of up to Rs4bn ($114m) have been set free
from the time-consuming scrutiny of the Central Electricity Authority
in a move to speed up approvals and hasten construction of smaller
power schemes.

A government notification has specified that only projects allotted
through competitive bidding below this threshold level will be spared
the rigours of CEA techno-economic scrutiny. All other projects will
continue to be governed by the existing guidelines, which provide an
exemption from the CEA clearance only if the capital expenditure is
less than Rs1bn ($28.5m).

The four-fold increase in the exemption limit is targeted at taking the
edge off the official scrutiny process, which is a source of ire to
nearly all project sponsors. Few projects have been cleared by the CEA
in the past five years.

The Power Minister feels that competitive bidding cane take care of the
cost and other factors which the CEA usually examines; therefore the
projects selected through open tender system need not be submitted for
the CEA scrutiny.

CEPA POWER PURCHASE DEAL APPEARS `ALL SET'

A project proposal in which CEPA of Hong Kong, part of Gordon Wu's
Hopewell Holdings empire, would secure agreement to build coal-fired
power stations in India, has moved forward with what are described as
`preliminary agreements' for a power purchase agreement.

CEPA is seeking to set up 10,560 MW of thermal capacity in the country,
probably using a series of 660 MW off-the-shelf base load power units.
The deal, when finalised, would be a record-breaker for India (and for
Wu), given that it would be the largest private sector scheme of its
kind for Asia's second most populous country after China. Negotiations
for the project began in 1993.

Under the agreement, which involves both the central government and
various state authorities, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana
states are committed to lift 1,300 MW, 1,200 MW, 800 MW and 700 MW
respectively from the 6 x 660 MW first phase of the 16-unit scheme. The
units would be installed at Hirma in Orissa State.

The first unit will be commissioned within 36 months of the financial
closure, and one unit is to be added at each subsequent three-month
interval. Power from the first two units will be wheeled to Gujarat.

A significant aspect of the preliminary deals is that the state
governments will establish "an appropriate payment guarantee structure"
for power purchases from the Hirma project. CEPA also wants to tap into
World Bank guarantees, but this will be no easy task given the Bank's
increasing requirements for a more transparently commercial approach to
power generation by the heavily subsidised and money-losing state power
boards.

World Bank financing, or support by other national aid agencies or
multilaterals, will be important for CEPA which, like other private
power sponsors, recognises the need to create a multinational
`cocktail' of financing arrangements to make infrastructure projects in
high risk developing countries work.

Another signatory to the preliminary agreements is Power Grid Corp of
India, which will develop the transmission system necessary to wheel
the power.

PRESSURE ON FOR FURTHER DABHOL TARIFF TRADE OFF

Last-minute jockeying between Enron and its partners in the Dabhol
project consortium and the Maharashtra government was taking place as
Power in Asia went to press, suggesting that Enron Development Corp. of
the US may yield further concessions for lower tariffs for India's
first private sector LNG power project.

The talks have been under way for months between the two warring
parties to revive the two-phase, $2.5bn power project at Dabhol, which
was ordered by the new state government to be suspended last summer
after construction was under way and financial close had been arranged
with the state's previous government.

Enron in Houston was tight-lipped Friday, saying only that "we are
waiting for Saturday" -  by which time a special cabinet meeting of the
Maharashtra state government will have taken place to consider the
latest Enron/government position.

If there is much more delay, arbitration proceedings against the state
brought by Enron and its partners Bechtel and GE Capital, will be got
under way in London. They are scheduled for January 15.

One aspect of the latest speculative offer is a marginal reduction by
Enron in the tariff, at which the 2,015 MW project will sell
electricity to the state power board, to Rs1.89 levelised tariff agreed
earlier in return for which the power board will lift power at more
than the 90% plant load factor mentioned in the original power purchase
agreement.

KERALA FAST-TRACK SHORTLIST

Nine project developers have been selected for small, fast-track
projects as part of the emergency plan of Kerala state to overcome a
400 MW power shortage which is hurting the economy. The projects would
range in size between 15 MW and 30 MW.

Proposals for the projects, to go up in the next year, were called by
the state-owned Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and the Kerala
State Industrial Development Corp. (KSIDC).

The developers with project locations in brackets selected by the KSIDC
include the following:

* Lok Housing with EDL of Australia (Bekaal, Malappuram and Chavara).

* IPCO-AGVL (Balusseir, Walayar and Kanjikode).

* BSES (Kakkanad and Technopark).

* Kings International Squa Marine Exports/Steag (Koothuparamba).

* Dalmia Bros. (Kanidkode).

These power stations are to come near industrial clusters suffering
from chronic power shortages. The developers have quoted tariff levels
of between Rs2.09 and 2.13/kWh.

The power sales tariff quoted by proposed sponsors picked up by the
KSEB varies from Rs2.10 to Rs2.63. Its choice of developers includes:

* Euro Capital (Vizhinjam, Kuttikatur, Mudakkayam, Nilambur and
Perinthalmanna).

* ABG (Kasargod and Kanhangad).

* Balaji Industries (Kodungaloor).

* Contake Abadi (Veli).

IFC BACKS AES WITH $79M LOAN FOR MUZZAFARGARH

The International Finance Corp (IFC) has signed an investment agreement
with AES Pak Generation (Private) Co. (AESPG) to provide a $79.5m
finance and equity package to help finance the $350m power plant
planned for Muzzafargarh in southern Punjab.

The IFC said the amount will be split into $39m equity and the
remaining will be raised through a syndicated loan.

The AESPG is the second IFC-financed tie-up with AES in Pakistan. The
project calls for construction of a 360 MW oil-fired power complex,
which will be equipped with a flue gas desulphurisation facility, the
first such plant of this type in the country.

Additional financing will come from a variety of sources, with
commercial funding coming from ING, Dresdner Bank, Natwest  and Korea
Merchant Banking Corp. In addition, the Japanese Export-Import Bank
will provide a loan of $148m.

Singapore-based AES Transport, a subsidiary of AES Corp of the US, will
be turnkey contractor for the project. AES will have an equity stake of
$85m, according to Shahzad Qasim, director of AESPG.

He said that AES expects to start generating 720 MW from both its
Pakistan operations by December 1997 - the other unit is under
construction at Lal Pir in Punjab and it reached financial close
earlier this year.

WAPDA, the state power utility, will lift the electricity under a 30-
year agreement, while another government, Pakistan State Oil (PSO),
will supply fuel oil under a 30-year agreement.

Vijay Chaudhry, IFC power division manager, said the agreement brings
to $280m the corporation's investments in the private power sector.

* The privatisation commission has appointed the IFC as financial
adviser to the privatisation of the Faisalabad Electric Area
Electricity Board. The IFC will help lay out a framework for the
separation of the FAEB from WAPDA so that it can operate as a privately
owned and regulated power distribution company.

The regulatory framework will establish rules for the rate-setting
mechanism, FAEB's interaction with WAPDA, the National Electric Power
Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) and private power generators. The success
of unbundling FAEB from WAPDA should provide a guideline for the
privatisation of seven other distribution boards.

NEW DATES FOR SRI PRIVATISATION

The Sri Lanka government has set new dates for starting to privatise
the power sector by calling for a strategic partner for Lanka
Electricity Co, Officials said.

"We have extended the date for submitting expressions of interest to
January 16, 1996 from December 1, 1995," an official of the Public
Enterprise Reform Commission, which oversees privatisations, said.  The
new agenda is the result of requests made by power operators, asking
for more time, the official said.

The commission first advertised locally and overseas in late October,
asking for power operators interested in taking a 51% in LECO, to
express interest by December 1.

"We got over 10 expressions of interest and a host of requests on
December 1, asking for more time," the official said.  According to the
new timeframe, the short-list of operators pre-qualified to bid will be
made available not later than January 23, the official added.

LECO, the second largest power distributor in Sri Lanka, handles nearly
20% of electricity generated in the country.  The balance is
distributed by Ceylon Electricity Board, the state-owned monopoly power
generator.

WB, JAPANESE LOCK DOWN FINANCING FOR GHAZI BAROTHA

The World Bank and the Japanese government have announced their
respective contributions towards the Ghazi Barotha dam. The Bank
announced just before Christmas that it would provide a $350m loan
towards the cost of the $2.25bn scheme. The Bank's financing will
account for 15.6% of the project's requirements.

The Bank's commitment to the scheme shows that it is still backing
large hydropower projects - this was in doubt because of its withdrawal
from the Arun III hydropower scheme in Nepal earlier this year (See ADB
feature).

The  scheme will involve works near the village of Ghazi, a 52 km long
power channel, a power complex near Barotha village to generate about
6,600 GWh of energy annually, transmission facilities and environmental
management and resettlement plans. The forecast of Pakistan's
unconstrained commercial energy demand calls for an annual increase of
about 6.7% up to 2008.

According to Zoubeida Ladhibi-Belk, power engineer at the Bank's South
Asia Department, the project will reduce the high cost of electricity
and will boost access to power in the country's rural areas.

The Bank has been careful to ensure that all environmental pitfalls
associated with such projects have been taken into account before
committing itself to backing the scheme.

According to the Bank, a total of 22,360 people will be affected by the
project, mostly only to a limited extent. Of these, some 900 living in
110 housing units will need to be resettled. An integrated regional
development plan has been developed to provide health and education
programmes.

Meanwhile, Japan's OECF said it will provide $350m towards the scheme.
It will provide the funds in two phases. The first will consist of
$200m and will be offered during the current financial year, while the
second tranche of $150m will be released after the utilisation of funds
for the first phase. The decision to provide funding in two phases
followed detailed OECF analysis. A Japanese delegation declared itself
"satisfied: that the project was economically viable.

WU PROJECT GROUNDBREAKING

Prime Minister Bhutto will perform the ground-breaking ceremony at the
site of the 5,280 MW coal-fired power plant earmarked for Keti Bander
in Sind province. The project is being undertaken by Consolidated
Electric Power Asia, part of Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings of Hong
Kong.

The move is a strategic breakthrough, not only because of its
ceremonial value but because it further confirms the momentum that has
gathered behind what promises to be Pakistan's largest thermal power
project, proposed by the entrepreneurial Wu in 1993.

The invitation to the groundbreaking was made by Agha Tariq Khan, the
Sind Mineral Development Minister.

The project's cost, including all the associated infrastructure,
including a coal terminal to handle imported coal and roads to handle
domestic coal at the project's later phases, is put at $8bn. Initially
this will be much less as the project will be built in a series of
single 600 MW units.

The plants would ultimately require 30mt-35mt of coal annually.
Officials close to the government said CEPA had already provided $5m to
the Sind government to carry out a feasibility study of Ket Bander,
where eight units will eventually be installed, providing financing can
be raised for a private power scheme of such a scale.

NEA, NPC BENEFIT FROM CASH ADVANCES

The National Electrification Administration and the National Power
Corp. are among the biggest recipients of cash advances from the
government, which an inter-agency committee wants to stop to lessen
money claims on the Treasury.

Of the Ps44.4bn ($1.8bn) of such advances as of last October, Ps5.6bn
went to the NEA and Ps4.50bn to NPC.

One way in which NPC's dependency on government handouts will be
reduced will be signposted this year when NPC starts offering
hydropower projects to the private sector, to be built on a BOT basis.

The offers will apply to projects planned for completion between 2000
and 2005. This is something of an experiment as the government's and
NPC's privatisation programme has revolved around thermal power
projects, not the more capital-intensive hydropower schemes.

Excluded in the bidding are the construction of two hydros with a
combined capacity of 300 MW in Kalayaan in Laguna, south of Manila, and
the rehabilitation of the 350 MW hydro scheme in Caliraya-Botocan-
Kalayaan, also in Laguna.

Contracts in both are already in the final stages of negotiations with
Argentina's Industrias Metalurgicas Pescamera Sociedad Anonima. NPC is
trying to persuade the Board of Investments to grant tax exemptions and
other fiscal perquisites to hydro schemes.

To lure private investments, NPC itself is thinking of shouldering the
costs of putting up access roads and transmission lines as well as in
obtaining rights of way to and from each project.

Among those to be the subject of bidding are the 29 MW Timbaban scheme
in Visayas in the Central Philippines; and the 32 MW Villasiga unit in
Antique, a 150 MW complex in Bulanog-Batang in Bukidnon in Mindanao;
the 300 MW Pulangi project in Bukidnon and the 224 MW Agus III in Lanao
del Sur.

* The Board of Investments has approved tax breaks for two geothermal
power projects to be built by PNOC-Energy Development Corp. One is a
PS6.04bn geothermal steam field and a 120 MW power plant in Mount Labo
in Camarines, south of Manila. The other project is a PS2.5bn
geothermal steam field and power plant in Negros in the central
Philippines. It has a capacity of 40 MW.

W'HOUSE SETTLEMENT STILL FACES SUPREME COURT CHALLENGE

The infamous saga of the Westinghouse-built Bataan nuclear power
station dispute may be 99% over but there remains a niggling 1% that is
still to be resolved before the case can truly be said to be settled.

The legality of the recent out-of-court settlement of the dispute
between Manila and the US company (over bribe allegations stemming from
the 1976 contract award by the Marcos government to Westinghouse) is
still under challenge in the Supreme Court.

Some senators insist the settlement has to be ratified by them, but the
National Power Corp. has formally lifted the ban on power equipment
manufactured or licenced by Westinghouse.

The lifting of the ban was jointly agreed by the two sides. It paves
the way for a second bidding at a still-unspecified date for a BOT
contract covering a gas-fired project in Ilijan in Batangas.

The first bidding for what was then a 1,200 MW gas-fired power contract
went to Hong Kong's CEPA in venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
(MHI).

The bid award was cancelled because of allegations that MHI was using
Westinghouse technology in its turbine equipment. Another bidder, AES
Transpower Corp., was also cited as a user of the offending technology.

PLN ALLOCATES $94M FOR SOUTH SULAWESI HYDRO PLANT

State-owned electricity company PT PLN plans to spend $94m on the
construction of a 74.8 MW hydro-electric power plant near Palu, Central
Sulawesi.

Construction of the plant is due to commence in 1999 and to be
completed in 2003, the official Indonesian news agency Antara reported
in late December.  To be known as Palu-3, the plant will use water from
Lake Lindu, located 40km south of Palu at an altitude of 960m above sea
level.  The lake has a surface area of 35.4 square kilometres, with a
normal debit of 16.5 cubic metres.

Palu-3 will be Central Sulawesi's largest hydro-power plant to date.

Evidently anxious to avoid the civil unrest that has accompanied
previous dam projects, PLN abandoned an earlier plan for Palu-3, which
would have seen the lake's water level rise by 2m, submerging 274.5ha
of cultivated land and 164 houses.

The head of PLN's Palu office was quoted as saying that the project
would not take any land from the local population nor damage the
environment in any way, notwithstanding is location with the Lore-
Kalamanta National Park.

A 983m pipeline with a diameter of 2.6m will channel the lake's waters
to 373m drop at which the turbines will be located.

The primary recipient of the electricity generated will be a cement
plant in the town of Donggala, which lies in the hills to the west of
Palu.  The cement plant will require at least 90 MW.  The difference is
to be made up by electricity from a diesel-powered plant in Silae, West
Palu.

The Silae plant currently has a capacity of 32.7 MW, which is scheduled
to be raised by 100 MW in the course of this year.

PLN's cost estimate for the project does not include a 46.5 km 150 kVa
transmission line linking the power station with Palu.

Central Sulawesi's electricity demand is projected to reach 148.2 MW by
2003.

PGN SIGNS $1.3BN DEAL WITH BRIGHTON LTD

State-owned gas company PT Gas Negara has signed a $1.3bn contract with
Brighton Ltd for the supply of gas to the latter's planned 600 MW
combined cycle power plant on Batam Island in Riau province.

Under the contract, Gas Negara will supply 60,000 standard cubic feet
per day to the Brighton plant for a period of 20 years.  The gas is to
be delivered through the Asmera-Duri-Batam pipeline, currently being
tendered.

The pipeline project is to be funded jointly by the Asian Development
Bank, the Japan Export-Import Bank, the European Development Bank and
Gas Negara.

Construction of the Brighton plant is due to commence in 1998.  It is
scheduled to begin commercial operations in 1999, with an initial
capacity of 150 MW.  To that stage, the project is said to involve an
investment of $100m.  The plant's capacity is to be expanded later to
600 MW, at an estimated additional investment of $500m.

Brighton, which is 55% owned by President Suharto's second son Bambang
Trihatmojo, is registered in Western Samoa.  The Batam power station is
being constructed together with Indonesian company PT Kresna Tara,
which is also 55% owned by Mr Trihatmojo.

Other partners in the project are Johanes Kotjo, Bambang Riyadi Soegama
and Wisma Suhardono.

Located 20 km south of Singapore, Batam Island is growing rapidly as an
export-oriented industrial zone.  As of June 1995 investment on Batam
had reached $5.3bn.  Exports from the island between January and June
1995 were worth $1.055bn, as compared with $1.339bn for the whole of
1994.

TENAGA HOPES FOR TARIFFS DECISION BY EARLY SPRING

Tenaga Nasional, the state-owned power utility, said it is optimistic
that the government will decide on its proposed restructuring of power
tariffs by the first quarter.

Ani bin Arope, the executive chairman, said the utility had submitted a
"rebalancing proposal" on tariff rates but declined to give details.
The move, first announced months ago, follows a government decision
earlier to turn thumbs down to a request for tariff hikes. The move
raised questions about Tenaga's freedom to implement tariff formulas
which affect its earnings and profits.

Ani said the new proposal takes into consideration the ration of power
consumer groups. "Domestic users now accounts for 40% of our customers
and the manufacturing sector 60%. It was the other way round
previously, he said.

The government had earlier suggested to Tenaga that it raise the
minimum rate charged for residential users under its tariff
restructuring proposal. Tariff hikes are important as Tenaga has signed
contracts to buy power from Malaysia's five private power producers;
without higher rates the state group will have to absorb the costs
instead of being able to pass them on the consumers.

Ani said Tenaga spent up to M$1bn for buying power last year and the
amount would rise to an estimated M$1bn in 1996. Tenaga reported a
pretax profit of M$1.64bn for the year-ended August 31, down 17% from
M$1.98bn the year before. This year's result, while nothing to write
home about, should be "no worse" than that recorded in 1995.

In the last financial year, Ani said Tenaga spent some M$3.4bn on
infrastructure. "We will spend M$4bn a year up to 2000 on
infrastructure." He said the country's power demand was growing at 12%-
15% a year.

Ani said Tenaga had signed an agreement to take a 20% stake in a $200m
power project in Pakistan. It was also in final negotiations for its
proposed 25% equity stake in a power project in Karnataka, India.

Tenaga also was considering an offer to take up a 15% stake in the
M$15bn Bakun hydropower project in Sarawak, a scheme, because of its
deforestation implications, which promises to be one of the most
controversial power schemes in Asia, and which has raised a chorus of
international disapproval and opprobrium.

TENDERS IMMINENT FOR BAKUN MEGA HYDROPOWER SCHEME

The Bakun Hydroelectric Corp. (BHC), the brainchild of Ting Pek Khiing,
the Sarawak timber baron, says it will issue its first tenders for the
M$15bn ($5.9bn) Bakun hydropower dam this month. The project will have
a capacity of more than 2,000 MW, including a 650 km subsea
transmission line from Sarawak to the Malaysia peninsula.

The company says it has already awarded a M$247m ($97m) contract to
Dong Ah Construction of South Korea to divert a river at the dam site
keep in the Borneo rainforests. Lahmeyer of Germany has been awarded
the engineering consultancy contract. Sixteen companies are claimed to
be positioning themselves to bid for the main engineering and
construction contracts.

The company says that construction will start in May, pending approval
of an Environmental Impact Assessment from a pro-dam Sarawak state
government, which will be a stakeholder in the project. The key player
is Ting's Ekran Bhd, which owns a controlling stake in BHC. It said
that a rights (new shares for old) and bond issue were still under
preparation and were not yet ready for shareholder approval.

The project has been roundly criticised by virtually every
environmental group looking into it because of the damaging effects of
the massive deforestation, the impracticality of the scheme being so
far from major population centres and the dislocation of local
tribespeople. It is estimated that the dislocation could affect 10,000
people.

Nevertheless, the scheme is going ahead, not least because of the
support of the government, which, through Tenaga Nasional, the state-
owned utility, will be a part shareholder, as will the national pension
fund. Ting and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad are also close friends.

Ekran spokesman Sunny Khoo said recently that the company hoped to
raise M$400m from the sale of 8m cu. m of logs. Last August, the
company sold the rights to 3m cu. m of timber to a company called
Ultimate Strategies Bhd for M$405m. Khoo said at the time that if the
company could not get the price it wanted for the timber "then we will
log it ourselves." The sam site, and the timber on it, covers 80,000
hectares.

But according to a Kuala Lumpur-based foreign broker, "It is difficult
to see exactly who will want to put their money into Bakun. Local
investors who enjoy a gamble might be interested but then they want
their money back fast. The payback from Bakun could stretch well into
the next century."

Nevertheless, the government deems the project essential because of
anticipated electricity shortfalls in the next century. The government
recently stated it would not review or reschedule mega projects it
considered critical for continued economic development.

PROTESTS FORCE SHIFT OF WASTE POWER SITE

The cabinet has decided to relocate the controversial waste-to-energy
power plant in the northern province of Chiang Mal in a move to end the
year-long protest by locals.

The decision was made on December 26 as protest against the garbage-
lignite fired power house seemed to peak as some 300 villagers from
Hang Dong district, where the 20 MW facility was to be built, staged a
rally at Government House in Bangkok.

The decision is a defeat for the Government, and the Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA), who failed to convince the local people,
after a public relations stint, that the project was environmentally
friendly.

Speaking after the Cabinet meeting, Technology and Environment Minister
Yingphan Manasikarn insisted the cabinet's resolution does not mean the
scrapping of the project, sponsored by PEA.

He said the cabinet has taken a view that the project should remain
because it would help solve Chiang Mai city's mounting garbage problems
while contributing to the provision of electric power.  It would be
relocated to other districts in the province provided that locals
agree, Yingphan said.

Deputy Interior Minister Kiatchai Chalchawarat, who oversees PEA said
certain areas in San Sai and San Pa Tong districts of Chiang Mai may be
alternative sites for the facility.

At one point four months ago, Kiatchai, who was sent to brief some
5,000 residents about the project at Hang Dong, narrowly escaped an
attack by a mob of villagers angered by the government's refusal to
scrap the scheme.

Villagers feared that their backyard would be turned into a dumping
site of garbage and the combustion of rubbish and the lignite would
create adverse environmental impact to their neighbourhood.

For the time being, it is not known the extent of effect the Cabinet's
resolution has on the $57.2m contract PEA awarded last March to
Kvaerner EnviroPower AB of Sweden to build the plant (PiA 173, Apr 3).

Yingphan only said that PEA would need to negotiate with Swedish
offshoot of Norwegian Kvaerner industrial group about the new operating
environment.

The scheme was earlier set to come on line on December 5, 1996.  But
opposition has delayed construction for nearly a year, making it
impossible to achieve that date.

DSM TO GET $40M

Thailand will earmark 1bn baht ($40m) budget for its demand side
management (DSM) project in 1996 as part of the continuation of its
energy conservation programme.  According to Sithiporn Ratanopas, EGAT
DSM director, 300m baht will go towards advertisement to promote public
awareness on energy conservation.  The advertising effort will focus on
promoting energy-efficient electrical appliance like refrigerators, air-
conditioners, ballasts and compact fluorescent bulbs.  The remaining
700m baht fund will for efficiency testing of air conditioners and
refrigerators, and developing a thermal storage and efficient motor
programmes.

EGAT is attempting to replace 20m typical ballasts in hotels and large
buildings nationwide with those which can save up to 40% of electricity
consumption.  EGAT will also use an energy saving label campaign with
7,00-27,000-BTU air conditioners in 1996.  The degree of energy-saving
capacity indication will vary from one to five.  In 1996, EGAT will
begin to import 20 watt compact fluorescent tubes, which will replace
conventional 100 watt bulb.   They will be sold 20% below import price.
 The volume of import will be 1.6m units, worth 306m baht.

The power authority has spend 87m baht to promote "slim" fluorescent
and energy-saving label campaigns in 1995.  The success of the two
campaign is a booster for EGAT to go further with its energy
conservation campaign in 1996.  Sithiporn said the DSM project would
help reduce Thailand's power consumption by 10%, or 100bn units per
year.

OLD HYDRO SCHEME GETS NEW UNIT

EGAT marked the completion of a 2.71 baht *$108.4m) scheme that further
maximises the hydro benefits derived from Thailand's first
hydroelectric dam.

The opening of the Lower Mae Ping project, an extension of the 31-year-
old Bhumibol dam in the northwestern province of Tak, was officiated by
HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on December 28.

An additional turbine generating unit, the eighth of Bhumibol and of a
pumped storage type, will beef up Bhumibol's combined installed
generating capacity by 32% to 720.8 MW, starting this month to augment
peak power supplies.

The Lower Mae Ping dam was built across the Mae Ping river some 5 km
downstream of the Bhumibol dam in the province's Sam Ngao district.  It
is 200 metres wide and eight metres high.  Construction began in June
1991, but the cost inflated from 2.35bn baht to 2.71bn baht.

The secondary dam helps to hold back the stream flowed through Bhumibol
and the pumps divert part of the water back to the main dam by a pump
which will be operated during the off-peak period.

EGAT director Somboon Manenava said the Lower Mae Ping dam could helps
to conserve about 450m cubic metres of water annually which would other
be drained out from the system.  The project is capable of pumping back
3.5m cubic metres of water each day back to the main Bhumibol dam for
irrigation and power generation.

Lower Mae Ping turbine generator was supplied by a consortium of
Kvaerner Energy AS and ABB Power Generation Ltd.  The civil works were
undertaken by Vianini Lavori SpA.

Meanwhile, as additional sites for developing new hydro have either run
out or have been restricted by environmentalists' opposition, the Thai
power authority is turing to pumped storage to maximise benefits from
existing dams.

EGAT is now assessing he economic proposition of installing pumped
storage systems at the Khirithan dam in Chanthaburi, the Chulabhorn dam
in the northeastern province of Chaiyaphum and Ta Tung Na dam in the
western province Kanchanaburi.

EGAT g-m Preecha Chungwatana said these possible pumped storage sites
are in various stages of study.  That of the Khirithan seems to be in
the most advanced phase with reports are mostly completed and a public
relation campaign is being exercised to win approval from villagers.

It is too early to say how EGAT would proceed with possible pumped
storage projects nor to detail how much more electrical power they can
render, according to the EGAT chief.  The current installed generating
capacity of Khirithan is 12.70 MW, 40 MW at Chulabhorn 40 MW and 38 MW
at Ta Tung Na.

EGAT has already completed two pumped storage projects, one at the Sri
Nakarin dam in Kanchanaburi with installed capacity of 720 MW and more
recently at Bhumibol.

A third pumped storage scheme now under construction is the Lam
Takhong, rated 1,000 MW, in Nakhon Ratchasima, some 200 km northeast of
Bangkok.  The initial phase of the scheme with is slated to come on
line in stages beginning in the year 2000 (PiA 191, Dec 11).

According to Preecha said the pumped storage hydroelectric projects are
viewed generally as the best method to fully utilise the country's
limited hydro resources both for the purpose of power generation and
irrigation.  EGAT has no firm plan to start any new dam projects.  As
at the end of November EGAT was operating 53 hydro generation units
with a combined installed capacity of 2,690 MW, representing about 18%
of EGAT's total installed capacity of 14,595 MW.

SETBACK FOR MALAY POWER EXPORTS

Malaysia's bid to export electricity to Thailand has initially met with
rejection from its potential Thai buyer, and the prospects for
establishing an agreement now seem remote.

Preecha Chungwatana, EGAT's g-m said the basic power tariff and supply
terms offered by Tenaga Technology Perlis (TTG), part of Malaysia's
Tenaga Nasional Bhd, are unacceptable.

TTG proposed a base tariff of 6 cents/kWh at the delivery point on the
Thailand-Malaysia border as well as requiring EGAT to take delivery of
the entire proposed load of 300 MW on a "fully despatchable" basis, on
a firm and full continuous basis for the entire life of the long-term
supply contract.

The EGAT chief said the proposed price is simply too high as it exceeds
the rate on which EGAT pays for electricity purchased from other
sources such as Laos or for power generated from EGAT's own power
plants in Thailand.  The current base price of power EGAT buys from
Laos is around 4 cents/kWh.

Furthermore, EGAT is only prepared to take the full proposed load
during Thailand's peak afternoon/early evening power demand with a
provision to guarantee a minimum offtake of 50% - 60% of the total
proposed capacity at any time of the day.

EGAT's reaction to the terms proposed by TTG could spell doom of the
large natural gas-fired combined-cycle plant being planned by Tenaga in
northern Malaysian peninsula state of Perils near the Thai border.

EGAT has already made its stance known to TTG and asked the Malaysian
outfit to sweeten its proposal and come up with a new offer later.  But
the EGAT chief expressed doubts if TTG could reduce the offered power
tariff further because the cost of power generation in Malaysia is
high.

According to Preecha, Malaysia initially wanted to sell its indigenous
natural gas to Thailand, but later opted to sell electricity generated
from its natural gas as this energy form provides greater
profitability.  (PiA 178, June 12).

The EGAT chief noted that Thailand, especially its southern region, may
not need to rely on the proposed power sales from Malaysia in the short
term because of EGAT's surplus generating capacity in the region.  EGAT
presently has a combined installed generating capacity of about 1,200
MW in the region while demand is about 1,000 MW, therefore, he added.

Meanwhile, Laos has continued to make new offers to sell electricity
from several of its hydro electric power stations to EGAT.  Lately,
Laos and groups of international companies have presented details of
Nam Thuen I and Nam Ngum projects to EGAT officials, said Preecha.

LAMPANG LIGNITE SCHEME MAY BE BACK ON AGAIN

EGAT is eyeing opportunities to revive a plan to build a huge power
house using indigenous lignite reserves in the northern province of
Lampang.

EGAT Chief Preecha Chungwatana pointed to the possibilities of reviving
the 2,400 MW project, now on the "indefinite" waiting list after being
shelved in 1924.  The process of reviving this multi-billion-dollar
scheme could start as soon as EGAT succeeded in convincing authorities
and the public that the lignite-fired power plant was indeed
environmentally acceptable.

EGAT's existing lignite-fuelled Mae Moh power station in this province,
700 km north of Bangkok, has been in the centre of public criticism and
protests for causing pollution to its neighbourhood due to its emission
of sulphur dioxide and dust for several years.

Over the past two years, EGAT has started to equip sulphur dioxide
control systems to six of the newer generating units at the plant.

For the time being, there seems to be a good chance of proving that the
lignite-fired power station can be environmentally friendly, given that
the desulphurising systems installed in some generating units at Mae
Moh have worked well in effectively curbing sulphur dioxide emission.

The revival of the Lampang project is basically aimed at serving two
purposes.  First, to utilise the remaining lignite reserves at Mae Moh,
estimated at some 600mt in the "mineable" reserve category.  Secondly,
the additional generating capacity would enable EGAT to respond to the
country's fast-growing electricity demand in the future.

NEW ADB PLEDGE TO BACK CHINESE HYDRO AT TING RIVER

A total of 600 MW of peak power generating capacity, capable of
generating an average of 1,520 GWh of electricity a year, will be added
onto a major hydro scheme planned for the Ting River, in the Mianhuatan
Valley in Fujiian Province, China, with the help of a $170m loan from
the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

The project, costing a total $721m, all of which - apart from the ADB
loan - will be financed by Chinese loans and funds, is going to involve
the construction of: a 111-metre high, 302-metre long, roller-compacted-
concrete gravity dam and gated spillway; an underground power station
with four 150 MW turbine generator units and related tunnels; a ship
hoist to enable barges of up to 500t capacity to pass safely over the
currents at the dam site; and two single-circuit, and one double-
circuit 220 kV transmission lines, with a total length of 360 km and
substation facilities, connecting the new power station to the Fujiian
grid.

According to Arun Adarkar, the ADB's US chief direct beneficiaries of
the project will be industrial, residential and agricultural consumers
who now endure power shortages during peak hours, as a consequence of
the province's rapid economic growth.  The latter averaged 13.8% a year
from 1985-1994.

During the same period electricity generation in the province increased
almost fourfold.  However this expansion failed to keep pace with
demand, and the Fujiian Province's Electric Power Bureau estimated
supply shortages in 1994 of over 1,100 GWh, or 7.2% of annual sales.
ADB reckons this may be an under-estimate.

Meanwhile, indirect beneficiaries will be residents, and industrial and
agricultural enterprises situated downstream on the Ting River.  These
stand to gain because a reservoir is going to be created at the hydro
site, 64 square metres in size with a flow regulating storage capacity
of 1,122m cubic metres.  However at the dam site itself an estimated
36,000 people out of 41,000 living in the area will be displaced by
flooding, and will have to be re-located.

The project will help develop hydropower, a renewable resource, and
reduce Fujiian's reliance on coal, which causes pollution and is mainly
imported.  At the end of 1994 the installed capacity of the Fujiian
Power Grid was 5,261 MW; 3,261 MW of this was provided by hydro plants
(62%), and 2,000 MW by thermal plants (38%).  Only about 30% of
Fujiian's hydro potential has been developed so far.

As well as the $170m loan, ADB is providing $300,000 in technical
assistance to implement institutional reforms.  The underlying aim of
these is to separate the management of the Fujiian Province's Electric
Power Bureau from the management of the Fujiian Province's government.
In addition the technical assistance will be used to overhaul the
structure and levels of the Province's electricity tariffs.  ADB
sources say this is an area where a lot of work has to be done as
China's electricity pricing system in general is still extremely
distorted and often relies on subsidies.

The Mianhuatan Valley project will be the biggest of five-cascade hydro
schemes on the Ting River.  The other four are: a 140 MW Qingxi plant
in Guangdong Province, which has been commissioned; a 40 MW Jinshan
project which is under construction; and a 51 MW Huilong project and a
30 MW Shang Hang project which will be constructed after 2000.

The project confirms ADB's commitment to China.  Though a relatively
new borrower of the Bank, China is now the Bank's "biggest borrower"
for power projects, ahead of all of ADB's other clients.

WEAK HK ECONOMY FORCES CLP TO TRIM OUTLAY

China Light and Power has revised down its capital expenditure forecast
for 1992-1999 from HK$54bn to HK$52bn.

It is the second time within two years that CLP has had to revise down
its capital expenditure.  In 1994 the company trimmed capital
expenditure from HK$60bn to HK$54bn.

The reason for the current revision is the same as that given two years
ago, a drop in consumer demand for electricity, according to the
company.  The announcement was made recently at CLP's annual general
meeting in Hong Kong.

The fall in demand has meant that CLP has had to delay the
commissioning of the last four units of the Black Point Power station
until 2002.

The first four units of the 2,500 MW power station will start being
phased in this year.

CLP chairman Sir Sidney Gordon told the AGM that because of the drop in
demand the company had decide not to take part in the Daya Bay two
nuclear power plant at Ling Ao in Guangdong province.  Sir Sidney CLP
has had to react to the economic changes now taking place in Hong Kong.

He said that over the past 12 months Hong Kong had experienced an
unemployment rate of 3.6%, the highest in nine years; a slowing growth
of gross domestic product to 4.8% and flat retail sales.

"From our information some 30 factories either relocated to China or
shut down during the first six months of 1995, due to high operating
costs in Hong Kong, especially wages and rental costs," Sir Sidney
said, "and the trend is likely to continue."

"All these point to the urgent need for Hong Kong to lower its cost
structure in order to make it an affordable place in which to conduct
manufacturing and commercial business," he said.

"Our core business in Hong Kong, a barometer of the local economy, is
showing signs of change.  Sales to the manufacturing sector, for
instance, which used to form the backbone of our business and
contributing more than a third of our total sales, has dropped to half
that figure and is likely to go down even further over the next few
years."

He said that annual growth in overall sales is expected to hover
between 3% and 5.5% in line with GDP forecasts.

Sir Sidney said CLP acknowledged there was a problem, and the company's
senior management had spent the last 18 months carrying out a
comprehensive review of the company's position.  The result has been a
`macro-strategic plan' and a detailed' change plan.'

"The plans will focus on improving the utilisation of assets and
resources, streamlining procedures and setting and achieving a
performance target benchmarked to world's best practices," he said.

"At the same time we are leveraging our core skills in the engineering
and finance streams to develop new businesses in China and other parts
of Asia.

"In essence the strategic plans calls for the company's management to
take active steps to ensure the continued success of the core business
in Hong Kong and to explore investment opportunities elsewhere."

Sir Sidney said that due to the slowing down in local demand the
company had decided to reduce the size or defer the commissioning dates
of various power generating and transmission projects which should
result in large savings.

The delaying in commissioning of the last four units of the gas-fired
Black Point is part of the cost-saving exercise.

Sir Sidney said CLP intended to stretch the transmission and
distribution system by making it "work harder".  In doing so, he
admitted that there would be an "element of risk which, whilst
manageable for a short period, should not be either overlooked or
forgotten."

"In addition, management has imposed stringent control on manpower and
other operational expenses which we believe will bring about
significant savings by the end of the decade," he said.

On tariff increases, Sir Sidney said that "over the next few years
tariff increases will be below the prevailing inflation rate.  This is
no small commitment in view of the fact that in the past 10 years our
basic tariff has lagged behind inflation by nearly 80%," he said.

CHINA PIPING NATURAL GAS TO HONG KONG

China has begun piping natural gas to Hong Kong under a 20-year term
contract to feed the territory's power industry starting January 1,
officials from state-owned China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC)
said.  The gas is sourced from the Yacheng 13-1 field, located in the
South China Sea.  The field has an annual production of about 3.4bn
cubic metres of gas.  A total of 2.9m will be piped to Hong Kong via a
790 km pipeline, completed in June last year.  The remaining 0.5bn of
gas will be supplied to China's Hainan power station and chemical
plants via another 91 km pipeline.  Yacheng 13-1 development project is
51% owned by CNOOC, 14.3% by Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Corp
and 34.7% by Arco China.  The term supply into Hong Kong was signed
with Castle Peak Power Corp, a 50-50 joint venture between China Light
and Power and Exxon.  The piped gas will be used to feed the CLPs Black
Point Power station in Hong Kong.

MAJOR POWER SECTOR SHAKEUP

The Chinese government is to establish a National Power Corp to
supervise the supply of electricity throughout the country.

According to a report in the China Daily recently, the Ministry of
Power Industry is to be dissolved within the next few months and its
functions transferred to the corporation.

Power Industry Minister, Shi Dazhen made the announcement at a recent
conference in Beijing on China's power industry.

Although details are not clear, it is understood that the government
wants to separate the functions of enterprise from that of government.

According to the China Daily report the supervision of the industry
will be handled by the State Planning Commission and the State Economic
and Trade Commission while the China Electricity Council will act in an
advisory capacity between government, industry and enterprises.  The
National Power Corp will be the first step in the restructuring
process.

According to the report the National Power Corp will be the umbrella,
or parent, with regional companies as its subsidiaries.  Regional
companies will be responsible for provincial power companies who in
turn will be responsible for local power plants.

Science research and design institutes and colleges will become parts
of the National Power Corp and relations between them will be
established on the basis of property ownership.

Shi said China had installed power generators with a capacity of 75,000
MW over the past five years, including hydropower machines with 13,000
MW capacity.  Production of electricity has increased on an average
growth of 9.8% in the last five years, compared with 8.8% during 1986-
1990.

N-PROBLEMS AT JAPC, TOHOKU

Japan Atomic Power Co (JAPC) and Tohoku Electric Power Co have
encountered problems that required the shutting down of reactors late
last month.  JAPC's Tokai reactor was shut down following a seawater
leakage; Tohoku Electric's Onagawa-2 BWR in Miyagi was shut down due to
a water leak.

The 825 MW Onagawa reactor is new and started commercial operations
last summer. Although the problems were minor, the closures were caught
(See Feature) in the wake of publicity connected with the shutdown of
the Monju prototype FBR .

SUMITOMO METAL PLANS TO MOVE INTO POWER SECTOR

Sumitomo Metal Industries, based in Osaka, intends to enter the
electric power wholesaling business by selling excess power that it
generates at its steel mills in Ibaraki, Osaka and Kansai prefectures.

The Kachima facility, Ibaraki, would sell power to Tepco, while the
other two facilities would sell to Kansai Electric if the company
submits successful bids to supply power.

Other steelmakers that are interested in the business are Kawasaki
Steel, Nippon Steel and Kobe Steel. Energy-related companies
considering moves to enter the power wholesale sector include Tomen
Corp., Japan Energy Corp. and Nippon Oil Co.

Moreover, Mitsubishi Materials Corp. is the first Japanese nonferrous
metal company to announce a plan to venture into the business. It hopes
to construct a coal-burning plant as large as 100 MW to sell power to
Nagoya-based Chubu Electric. Another option for Mitsubishi Materials is
to construct a coal burning facility that would supply Kyushu Electric,
which is headquartered in Fukuoka. In either case, the facility would
be constructed at an existing nonferrous metal or cement factory site.

DEMAND TO GROW 0.8%

Japan's electricity demand for this fiscal year ending March 31 is
expected to grow by a mere 0.8% from the previous year to 723.79bn
kilowatt hours, an industry research institute said.  Demand from large
industrial users is low in 1995/96, as a sluggishness domestic economy
has forced them to cut production because of growing inventories, the
Research Institute of Electric Power Industry said in a report.

Electricity demand in fiscal 1996/97 is forecast to rise by 1.9% to
737.41bn kWh.  An anticipated slight economic recovery in 1996/97 is
expected to drive up demand from large industrial users, the report
said.

If Japan goes through an exceptionally hot summer in 1996/97, as in
1994/95, electricity demand will surge by 4.4% from the previous year,
it said.  In electricity demand soared 7.4% from a year earlier.

Power generation in November rose 3.9% year-on-year to 65bn kWh, the
Federation of Electric Power Companies reported.

The federation said the increase in November electricity generation was
due to lower temperatures compared with a year earlier, which pushed up
heating demand.

Of the total electricity generation in November, nuclear power
generation by Japan's nine major electric power companies gained 13.8%
from the same period last year to 21.6bn kWh.

Hydropower generation surged 20.5% year-on-year to 3.5bn kWh.  The jump
reflects extremely low hydropower generation last November because of
water shortages.

Thermal power generation fell 4.7% due to the increase in nuclear power
generation, to 32.3bn kWh.

Japan's power utilities burnt 1.30m kilolitres (kl) of heavy fuel oil
for electricity during November, 1.47m kl of crude oil, 2.33m kl of
liquefied natural gas and 47,669 kl of naphtha, the federation said.

The companies consumed a total of 1.85mt of coal in November.

ENTERGY LOCKS UP CITIPOWER

Entergy Corp. of the US has completed its takeover for Citipower, the
last of five power distributors sold off by the Victoria government.

The deal had been expected. Entergy had been named as the preferred
buyer and will pay a total of A$1.75bn, which includes a capital
payment of A$1.58bn and franchise fees with a present value of A$173m.

Despite the apparent `sell out' to foreign interests - all five
distributors were sold to US companies - the deal is regarded as a
success for Victoria state. It has raised A$9bn, more than domestic
analysts had predicted. A total of $1.3bn of the Citipower sale will go
towards paying off the state's debts.

WHOLESALE PRICING CLAIMED TO BE `ANTI-COMPETITIVE'

Major power users who make up 30% of New Zealand demand believe interim
wholesale pricing arrangements are "highly anti-competitive." They say
there are better ways to provide a learning environment until full
wholesale competition comes in later in 1996.

Competition watchdog, the Commerce Commission, on the other hand has
formed a preliminary view that the benefits to the public from the
interim rules will outweigh any lessening of competition. However, it
will not issue a final opinion until after public hearings on January
18-19.

The rules govern the relationship between Electricity Corp. of New
Zealand (ECNZ), and Contact Energy, the new state-owned power firm
being created by splitting ECNZ. The market will be run by EMCO, the
Electricity Market Company, at present a joint venture of ECNZ,
TransPower (which operates the grid) and the Electricity Supply
Association of New Zealand. Contact is expected to buy part of ECNZ's
EMCO stake.

In a submission put to the Commission before it issued its preliminary
view, the Major Electricity Users Group (MEUG) says it is particularly
concerned that the anti-competitive aspects of the interim arrangements
will carry over into the final rules for the wholesale electricity
market. This group argues that the interim supply agreement and the
asset sale and purchase agreement between ECNZ and Contact preserve
ECNZ's existing level of dominance in the market.

MEUG disagrees that six months of trial is necessary. As there is no
certainty that these rates will flow through to become the final rules,
it suggests the market could invest time and skills in managing the
interim, only to find that experience had become redundant. It suggests
paper trials should be looked at as an alternative.

A different view has been put by the country's largest company,
Fletcher Challenge, which is both a user and a utilities investor. It
sees the proposed rules As a "practical method of moving forward" on an
interim basis. Like others, however, it insists they should only be
interim. It wants a "drop dead" clause before the date at which the
electricity from an independent power plant is due to be dispatched
because the rules provide no incentive for third party generation.

The Commerce Commission is considering the bridging pricing rules to
apply to two interim phases. The first runs to April 6 from the date of
settlement (probably February 1) at the sale of generating plant by the
ECNZ to Contact Energy. The major change during this period will be the
development of competition between Contact and ECNZ to run whichever is
the marginal power station.

In the second phase to end-September, the notified change in ECNZ's
energy supply contracts will be set on a day-ahead rather than a week-
ahead basis, the charge will be calculated using actual rather than
forecast demand and the actual price paid by power purchasers will be
calculated from the marginal cost of the last station used to meet
actual demand.

Arrangements for full competition after that have not yet been
finalised. Key features are expected to be that rather than ECNZ
forming contracts with its customers, generators and purchasers will
contract with a pool; purchasers will be for electricity; that day-
ahead price will reflect the market clearing price based on bids to buy
and offers to sell; that the cap on the price of electricity in force
up to end-September will disappear; and that generators and purchasers
will be able to contract outside the pool and to trade their position.

BP TO DEVELOP GAS RESERVES IN THE SAHARA

BP has struck a $3.5bn gas deal with Sonatrach and the Algerian
government to develop reserves deep in the Sahara. The deal will boost
BP's worldwide gas production by 30%. The site of the development is
near In Salah, deep in central Algeria and far distant from the civil
war. The joint venture will give BP access to the European gas market.
The venture will sell some 10bn cu. m of gas per year into southern
Europe via the Transmed pipeline into Italy and the under-construction
pipeline between Morocco and Spain. Sonatrach already exports 30bn cu.
m of gas, mainly via Italy.

John Browne, BP Exploration Director, said the deal was the first of
its type signed with Sonatrach, the sole gas producer in Algeria, for
the last 30 years. Under the deal BP will take 30% of the net after
expenses of the gas to be sold. Under a typical production-sharing
contract, the foreign oil company is likely to earn 15% of the net.
BP's favourable terms stems from Algeria's prolonged civil strife And
the high political risk.

Other companies are gathering round too. Exxon is starting talks on a
similar gas development deal. Ammar Makhloufi, the Energy Minister,
said the government would like to see two or three major projects
emerge in the In Salah area. Algeria is said to be anxious for US and
British involvement in the sector, now dominated by French and Italian
companies.  Other companies, such as Total and Repsol of France were
said to be in `negociation avancee' to develop a field, known as TFT
(Tin Fouye Tabankort), close to the Libyan border and several hundred
kilometres from the BP field., according to Al-Hayat newspaper. This
field is said to contain commercial quantities of natural gas (144bn
cu. m); LPG (15.6m tonnes) and condensates (16.6mt).

PetroBangla's subsidiary Bapex has made a `very significant' gas
discovery in the southern islands on the tip of the Bay of Bengal, the
first gas fiend in the area. The site is at Bhola, and the field will
increase the country's known reserves by 10%. Reserves at present are
10,000bn standard cubic feet, says Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, the
Energy Minister. The field will be Bangladesh's 18th commercial field

As part of its liberalisation, the government in 1993 offered several
of the country's 23 blocks for production-sharing. Domestic demand is
expected to rise eight-fold by 2020 to 5.5m cu. f/d. Among exploration
groups are Occidental, Cairns Energy and Holland Sea Search and Rexwood
Okland of the US.  Some 43% of the country's gas is used for the power
sector, 88% of which are gas-fired; 34% is used as feedstock to the
fertiliser industry.

VIETNAM OIL PRODUCTS IMPORT QUOTA

Vietnam's Ministry of Trade has set the oil products import quota for
1996 at 4.7mt, up from 4.5mt in 1995. The quota for crude and
condensates with a low paraffin content was set at 200,000t. The
ministry has allocated imports for diesel at 2.3mt, up from 1.04mt last
year; gasoline at 960,000t, up from 680,000t, fuel oil at 890,000t,
kerosene at 300,000t and aviation fuel at 250,000t. Vietnam's main
importer is Petrolimex, which was given a 3.1mt quota for oil products,
up from 2.8mt in 1995. Petrolimex's diesel quota was set at 1.47mt,
gasoline at 700,000t, fuel oil at 680,000t, kerosene at 150,000t and
jet fuel at 100,000t.

Last December, Petrolimex signed an annual term contract with Kuwait
Petroleum Corp to lift 500,000t of 1% sulphur diesel and 80,000t of jet
fuel starting this month. Petrolimex's remaining requirements will be
met through quarterly tender invitations and spot purchases. The
balance of imports will be handled by other companies, such as Petex,
Vietnam Airline Petroleum Co., and a new oil marketing firm,
PetroVietnam Oil Processing, Distribution and Marketing Co. (PVPDC).

PHILIPPINES OIL PRICE STABILISATION FUND

PNOC plans to inject Ps8.6bn in the depleted oil price stabilisation
fund, says Energy Secretary Francisco Viray. He said Ps5bn will be
released for the oil fund soon, but state-owned PNOC will have to find
other sources for the remaining balance of Ps3.6bn. The fund was set up
by the government in the 1980s to protect consumers from wild swings in
world oil prices and forex problems. Oil companies give money to the
fund if world oil prices are soft and if the peso is strong versus the
dollar, then draw against it if the opposite occurs.

With the rise in crude prices and a weakening of the peso, the fund has
been dwindling and a deficit of Ps7.6bn was reached by year-end. To
shore it up, the country's three main oil groups, Petron Corp,
Pilipinas Shell Petroleum; and Caltex Philippines have asked the
government to hike the price of oil products, which it did so last week
by three centavos per litre.

MALAYSIAN CONTROVERSY OVER OIL DISCOVERIES

Malaysia is embroiled in controversy as to whether it is preventing
foreign companies from bringing new oil discoveries into commercial
production. Petronas chairman Azizan Zainul Abidin denies that this is
so. "They (foreign oil majors) paid the risk money for exploration and
if they make a discovery and that discovery is commercial, there is no
way we can stop that." Petronas president Hassan Marican added that it
was not possible for Petronas to turn away development plans once a
contractor declares commerciality. But there is much grousing abroad,
with foreign oil company managers saying Petronas stalls the process by
bureaucratic foot dragging over approvals for budgets and field
development plans, including types of platforms, pipelines and other
technical issues. "Technically they are right, you can declare a field
commercial," said one manager. "And once you do that the clock starts
ticking on the lease."

Over the past decade, foreign oil groups have found 2.4bn bbl of oil
and equivalent gas in Malaysia, 20% of Malaysia's remaining recoverable
reserves,but none has been put into production, says Wood Mackenzie.
The 2.4bn bbl of new petroleum finds were discovered by 16 companies.
But since Malaysia offered its first production-sharing contracts to
foreign groups in the 1970s, only Shell and Esso, the original two
contractors, are in production. Of the 16, ten have closed their
offices in Malaysia. Under a standard production-sharing contract,
Petronas is entitled to 85% of all the oil produced, once the foreign
partner recovers costs. The terms are considered among the most
unfavourable to foreign partners. But analysts point out that
production costs are cheap, which is what makes the market reasonably
attractive.

CLO CONCEDES ALL TO ENEL

Italy's industry minister Alberto Clo gave a year-end present to the
state electricity corporation. By putting his signature to the
controversial concession which licenses ENEL to operate, Clo has not
only taken the corporation a further step down the path to an initial
public offering of its shares, but also appears to have ensured that
privatisation will not significantly effect the comfortable status quo.

Clo's decision to sign the concession has not won universal approval,
however. Indeed some wonder whether a hidden agenda lies behind the
move of a non-elected minister in a technocrat government that seems to
be rapidly approaching the end of its time.

The haste with which Clo has despatched ENEL's operating concession
from his desk has not been well received by the anti-trust authority.
The competition watchdog's firmly held view is that Clo has put the
cart way ahead of the horse. How Italy's electricity sector should be
reorganised should have been settled before drafting and signing the
concession. But a new structure for the electricity industry requires
parliamentary approval and the industry minister, who may not be much
longer in that job, was not prepared to wait for the politicians to
have their say.

UNAPACE, the autoproducers' association chaired by Giuseppe Gatti, the
former energy director general at the ministry of industry who was
replaced last February shortly after Clo became minister, was wholly
opposed to the minister's precipitate action. In a note sent to the
minister in the week before Christmas, the association wrote,
"UNAPACE's fundamental position is that this concession should not be
signed, but that attention should be directed towards the necessary
legislative reforms".

According to the autoproducers, the concession that Clo has given to
ENEL introduces incurable contradictions with possible new structures
for the Italian electricity industry. The present system will remain a
straitjacket in which ENEL will continue to operate "not only in
monopoly conditions, but substantially as a government offshoot, with a
public-type role incompatible with real privatisation".

In its note, UNAPACE raised various objections to Clo's concession for
ENEL and suggested that:

* the exchange and transmission of electricity produced by other
companies must be made possible to all operators on equitable and non-
discriminatory conditions, on the basis of prices approved and
regulated by the regulatory authority;

* cogeneration should be encouraged as well as renewable sources;

* sub-concessions of ENEL's activities should not be limited to wholly-
owned ENEL subsidiaries or to companies owned jointly by ENEL and
public local utilities;

* the planning of plant capacity needed to satisfy national
requirements should be entrusted to a government body or the regulatory
authority, not to ENEL;

* competitive bidding for new generating plant should apply only for
capacity aimed at supplying the tied, mass market, while simple
authorisation should apply to capacity needed for supplying large,
'qualified' customers, distributors and consortia.

UNAPACE expressed particular concern over ownership and control of
Italy's grid. The autoproducers' association considers that, regardless
of EU decisions or recommendations, a separate grid company should be
established in order to ensure that the costs of transmission and
related activities should be made transparent and to reduce the
possibility of cross-subsidies between production and distribution.
"This company should be made completely autonomous and independent of
every other operator in production and distribution, particularly
ENEL", stated UNAPACE.

The association's note to Clo expressed concern that control of
activities so important to the system's functioning by a private
company could heavily condition access. This would "risk prejudicing to
a substantial extent the effect of liberalising sales to large
'qualified' consumers". UNAPACE told the minister that an alternative
to an independent grid company would be one in which independent
producers and distributors, public utilities and ENEL would have equity
stakes. "However, none should have a controlling interest in the
company."

On the question of grid access tariffs, UNAPACE said that these should
be detailed by type of service and directly correlated to relevant
costs. To guarantee transparency, the regulatory authority should be
responsible for tariff setting.

Clearly, while the operating concession may have brought some seasonal
good cheer to ENEL, Clo's signature on the document has disappointed
UNAPACE, and runs contrary to the ideas of Italy's competition
regulator.

The anti-trust authority gave its opinion in December, though this has
not yet been published, because, it says, it would be improper to make
known its opinion before the concession has appeared in the official
gazette. This is expected in mid-January. The anti-trust authority is,
however, unlikely to let go of an issue on which it has on several
occasions taken a stand wholly divergent from the line Clo has
followed. Italy's competition watchdog is, however, able to bark rather
than bite.

* The year has opened with speculation about who will be appointed to
the chairmanship of the regulatory authority for the electricity
industry. Among the names that have been mentioned is that of industry
minister himself, Alberto Clo.

If the technocrat government headed by Lamberto Dini is replaced or
reshuffled, Clo could be looking for a job. Being able to show a CV
that contains placing the law establishing the regulatory authority on
the statute book and the drafting and signing of ENEL's operating
concession might make him seem the right man for regulator. And, having
been regarded by some as ENEL's man at the ministry, he could then be
known as its man at the authority.

COMMISSION STRENGTHENS IEM RESOLVE

In an unprecedented move at the end of 1995, the European Commission
put forward its first white paper on energy. Basing its document on
three broad objectives - overall competitiveness, supply security and
environmental protection - the Commission said it will use all the laws
at its disposal to liberalise the EU's internal market for electricity
and gas. But it warned that new constitutional powers may be necessary
to reach that goal.

Unveiling the document, Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutis said: "If
we are to achieve all these objectives, the Commission must raise the
question of whether a modification of the Treaty of Rome is necessary,
as Community action I believe is now limited by the absence of clear
provisions."

He said a sound and sustainable energy policy "is critical for our
future economic development. This white paper will be our blueprint for
action into the 21st century."

The 40-page document lays down a programme for the next three years,
covering everything from vehicle emissions to promotion of
cogeneration. It also singles out completion of the EU's internal power
market and achievement of a level playing field for economic operators
in the sector as fundamental objectives.

For example, the paper says the EU needs a set of coherent criteria in
order to apply the Treaty's competition rules more effectively in cases
where public service supply obligations are involved. It also insists
that all forms of energy, including fossil and nuclear fuels, should
have a fair chance to compete, meaning more transparency in their
pricing and taxation is necessary.

"Energy prices, especially electricity prices, should not be used as
parafiscal instruments to support specific forms of energy, since this
will create distortions of competition unless such measures reflect
external factors", says the paper. However, it makes allowances for
support measures in favour of renewables. The Community's range of
instruments that govern the reporting of fuel prices "will be further
developed with a view to including taxation transparency," it observes.

At the same time, the Commission wants a more transparent business
environment for investments in the EU's energy sector and says it will
use the "appropriate tools" such as energy-impact analysis to assess
national regulatory measures in the environmental, social and tax
fields.

Of particular concern, it said, is a need to ensure that procurement
procedures for infrastructure projects "respect key criteria in terms
of transparency and objectivity." Brussels said it will push for
establishment of a new "Energy Consultative Committee" under its
auspices (consisting of representatives from industry and labour
unions) to ensure "as much transparency as possible on the development
of Community initiatives" in energy policy.

Creation of the EU's internal energy market and a multiplicity of
players within it is necessary, says the white paper, for further
diversification of the Union's domestic fuel base, particularly for
electricity production: "Electricity producers should be able to choose
the most appropriate and cost-effective fuel within a competitive
framework as long as it does not undermine diversification "

Thus, according to the white paper, it is difficult to justify a
continued application of the EU's Directive 75/404, which forbids use
of fuel oil under certain conditions for electricity production.
Overturning the directive, it says, "would give electricity producers
increased flexibility, [while] an adjustment of indirect taxation to
ensure equality of opportunity between substitutable fuels would favour
future flexibility in power generation".

In the same vein, the Commission will wage battle against the trend to
encourage intensive energy use across the union. "The evidence suggests
that there remains a substantial potential for improvement," observes
Brussels in its paper. It said EU bodies will have to "mobilise all
their instruments" to support energy efficiency. The Commission plans
to issue a communication later this year analysing how fiscal tools can
be used to promote energy efficiency and renewables.

The Commission will also issue proposals in 1996 to ensure that energy
efficiency is incorporated as an industrial requirement when European
technical standards are drawn up for energy-consuming equipment. It
wants the EU's technical standardisation bodies located in Brussels -
CEN and CENELEC - to create an energy working group to ensure that
their draft technical standards promote energy efficiency, renewable
energies and energy transportation. This could run into problems
however: such an approach will have to reconcile efficiency objectives
with trade freedom and sufficient flexibility for industrial
innovation.

Tipping its hat to the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission says
less direct intervention in the energy market will be the rule of the
day. But it argues that more efficient monitoring tools will be needed
to analyse the sector and ensure that its structural and technical
changes do not conflict with the EU's energy policy goals.

A reinforced monitoring capability is needed, says the paper, to:

* ensure the proper functioning of the internal energy market;

* verify that new production capacity enjoys freedom of establishment,
especially for independent electricity producers;

* enforce fair competitive conditions for independent electricity
producers;

* confirm that different network-access systems yield comparable market
opening and market access in member states;

* establish cooperation on interconnected systems between national
regulatory authorities in both the gas and electricity sectors.

The paper notes that the instruments currently at the Commission's
disposal for ensuring transparency of investments, prices and energy
imports and exports "are unsatisfactory because the administrative
burden is not offset by an operational usefulness."

Such ineffectiveness, it said, is linked to delays in the publication
of data and poor coordination between member states. To correct the
situation, Brussels is proposing to provide national administrations
with a new energy data bank as well as an information network that
processes data more quickly. At the same time, it will lobby for a more
"complete, reliable and harmonised statistical system" at Community
level in the field of energy.

How national capitals will react to such a broad range of initiatives
is still unclear. Most have fought tooth-and-nail against any
intrusion, direct or otherwise, by the Commission on the territory of
taxation. While Brussels can justifiably argue in favour of more
transparency in energy prices, it will probably meet resistance to
"improved monitoring tools" that peek too much into national taxation
regimes and decisions.

Moreover, its call for yet more consultative committees and working
groups may fall on unresponsive ears, considering that the Belgian
capital is already groaning under the weight of endless such
committees.

Perhaps in anticipation of the opposition that its energy policy paper
is sure to spark, the Commission ends its document with a bow to the
need for a proper division of work between EU and national authorities
- subsidiarity - but hedges its position nevertheless. The white paper
places energy policy "within the existing institutional framework" of
the EU. But it concludes saying the Commission will make proposals "on
the question of whether a modification of the Treaty in the 1996
intergovernmental conference is necessary" via a report to be released
in the coming months.

Do not expect any bold move, though. The Commission made a stab at
inscribing energy policy in the Rome Treaty during the previous
intergovernmental conference in Maastricht, and got a resolute slap on
the wrist.

WIJERS PROPOSES DRIVE TO PRIVATISE

The publication at the end of December of the Dutch government's long-
awaited energy policy document confirmed many of the details leaked
through the month (PiE 212/18). The main thrust of the Energie Nota is
that the government is to privatise 35% of the electricity market and
40% of the natural gas market "in the very near future". Within five
years, two-thirds of the country's energy market will be privatised.
The energy infrastructure, however, will remain in public ownership to
safeguard supply and optimal central production.

The policy paper was formally presented by economic affairs minister
Hans Wijers at the end of last month.

The other two goals highlighted in the document - which sets out the
government's vision for the energy sector for the coming 25 years - are
to increase energy efficiency by one-third by 2020 and boost the share
of electricity production from renewable sources from the current 1% to
10%.

The aim, said Wijers, is to stabilise CO2 emissions rather than strive
for a reduction. The minister said that although this was a departure
from existing policy (and contradicts statements by the environment
minister) it is more realistic approach.

He said it was meaningless for the Netherlands to impose stricter norms
unless these were adopted by the EU as a whole. And he added that the
stabilisation of emissions in itself calls for considerable effort
particularly as the country's economy is expected to grow at a rate of
2%/yr in the next 25 years. Unless measures outlined in his policy
document are implemented, energy consumption and CO2 emissions could
actually rise, he warned.

The government's plans concerning privatisation were, to a large
extent, unveiled in advance of the energy policy paper. The document
now outlines the timetable as follows: in the immediate future,
consumers who use more than 10 GWh of electricity or 10 MMcm of gas
will be free to choose their supplier.

They will be followed within five years by users of 50 MWh of
electricity or 170 Mcm gas. In fact, companies in this category will be
able to apply for so-called "non-binding" status before the legislation
is in place although they will have to give a period of notice to their
existing supplier.

Users falling under the specified volumes will remain tied to one
supplier with regulated tariffs. It remains to be seen when this
category of smaller (non-domestic) consumer will enjoy the same freedom
of choice as other commercial users, says Wijers.

The electricity market will also be open to new distributors, both
Dutch and foreign. But the grid will, says Wijers, remain in the hands
of the current owners (the central electricity generating board SEP).
This is the best way to safeguard supplies and ensure optimal central
production, insists the minister. But he adds that an appeal procedure
will be available for electricity suppliers who feel they are unfairly
handled. This "natural monopoly" will also have an independent
watchdog.

Wijers claims that his proposals will place the Netherlands at the
forefront of energy market liberalisation in Europe, along with Britain
and the Scandinavian countries.

Concessions

According to major users, however, the plans fail to meet conditions
for increased competition in the market. Vereniging Krachtwerktuigen,
the association of large-scale users, which account for 80% of
commercial consumption, has urged economic affairs minister Hans Wijers
to focus more on opening up distribution to provide a counterweight to
his proposals to concentrate production.

Wijers' estimate that the reforms will deliver a cost saving of Dfl 500-
600m ($312-375m) is fine, but electricity users can only be sure they
are getting the lowest possible price when there are sufficient
alternative sources of power, a spokesman for the association said.

He said there are too few guarantees that new suppliers would have
access to the national grid under the same conditions as the central
electricity board producers and distributors.

Wijers' plan for an independent watchdog to ensure that every producer
will be treated equally is too vague and open-ended, the association
says, adding that free trade outside the sector will be obstructed by
established players.

Distributors could charge such high fees that it becomes impossible for
independent producers to make money from supplying customers via the
national grid.

While acknowledging the need for a powerful producer to enable the
Dutch energy sector to compete in a liberalised European market, the
association doubts that the plans will stimulate competition from
abroad and from independent producers as envisaged by Wijers. The only
way to achieve this is to give the electricity sector a fully
independent legal and economic status, it concluded.

The proposals contained in the policy document also indicate a
significant concession on the part of the minister on two points. The
first concerns his plans to merge the four existing producers (UNA,
EPZ, EPON, EZH) to create a single electricity production company with
distributors as shareholders. Wijers said this was necessary because
conflict between regional and national interests has led to over
capacity and operational inefficiencies.

The merger proposal caused an uproar (PiE 213/1) and the wording in the
policy document now calls for "one large-scale production company"
which leaves the option open for one or more breakaway production
companies to operate.

This could be the case in the south where the regional producer EPZ and
three local distributors PNEM, NUON and Deltan are already involved in
a far-reaching co-operation agreement. They have calculated that the
formation of a national electricity giant would result in extra costs
of Dfl 265m ($164.4m) for consumers in one province (Noord Brabant)
alone. Larger users would have to pay 25% more for electricity while
smaller customers would see a rise of 13%, they claim.

In the east, distributor NUON also prefers regional integration and
opposes the idea of "its" producer EPON being swallowed up by a
"bureaucratic monopoly".

Nevertheless, the move towards the integration of the production sector
will, says the policy document, have priority and energy director-
general Dessens has since said the outline of the new company will be
completed this year. A merger of all four producers would create a
concern with an annual turnover of Dfl 6bn.

Wijers has warned that reluctant shareholders may be forced to co-
operate with the government's merger plans, although he would prefer to
reach agreements with the parties involved.

Wijers argues that a large production company would benefit from
economies of scale, ensure more compatibility in terms of supply and
demand and - perhaps most importantly - would put the Netherlands in a
better position to compete with foreign producers once the EU
liberalises the electricity sector.

The second concession relates to the shareholding of the new production
company and is aimed specifically at appeasing Amsterdam city council.
The council is currently a shareholder (33%) in its regional production
company UNA but would have to sell its stake to a distributor under the
original proposals, something which it objects strongly to. Now Wijers
has said local authorities can also be direct shareholders in the
national producer.

Wijers' policy paper allocates Dfl 6m a year for a wide package of
energy efficiency measures for electricity generated by fossil-fired
plants. These include more long-term agreements with industrial sectors
and stricter standards for new buildings. Investment is needed because
"simple solutions will be exhausted by 2000" said the minister.

TAXING TIMES FOR NORWAY

The minority Labour government's plan to change the way generating
utilities are taxed is facing mounting hostility from some of the
affected interests.

The keenest criticism is being voiced by the so-called "hydro power
kommunes", local authorities which derive much of their tax revenues
from hydro plants located within their borders. LVK, the national
association of hydro power kommunes, called an extraordinary meeting on
January 10 to discuss the proposals, which it claims will undermine
local authority taxation rights and hit the country's sparsely
populated rural districts. A day earlier the opposition Centre
(Farmers') Party, which traditionally stands up for rural areas, held a
seminar on the tax reform. One of its conclusions was that the measure
was an "attack" on these areas. Media reports predict that LVK will
mobilise "massive opposition" to its approval by the Storting
(parliament).

The draft bill containing the proposed changes was tabled by the
finance ministry on December 15 (PiE 214/21). Initial reactions to it -
by all concerned - were moderate. This was mainly because the ministry
forecast, in the text of the bill, that the hydro power kommunes would
actually see their revenues from the sector rise under the new regime.
Since then, however, LVK has been doing its own sums to see how
specific local authorities would be affected. It claims that these
contradict the official figures.

In a letter to the ministry, LVK director Arvid Lillehauge says that
"... so far [our calculations] indicate that it is impossible to reach
the result indicated by the draft bill. On the contrary our
calculations show a fall in local authority tax revenues of such
magnitude that it does not accord ... with the intentions of the bill".

Lillehauge's request for the background material on which the official
calculations were based has been refused by the ministry, which says
that this material was collected on the understanding that details
would remain confidential.

The main changes proposed by the draft bill are:

* abolition of wealth tax on publicly-owned power utilities (private
companies - including privately owned power plants - have been exempted
from paying wealth tax since the general tax reform of 1992. Treating
publicly and privately-owned power companies in the same way, the
ministry points out, will have the advantage of eliminating an
incentive to privatise publicly-owned power undertakings for tax
reasons.)

* a switch from assessment on the basis of estimated value to
assessment on the basis of [annual] accounts, where publicly-owned
power utilities are concerned. That means, says the ministry, that the
latter will pay tax on profit, like other enterprises, and not tax on
the basis of estimated value as at present.

* abolition of tax exemption for power utilities in the kommunes which
own them. This will effect, inter alia, local authority-owned
distributing activity, which, recalls the ministry, is "to a great
extent ... exempt from tax at present".

* introduction of a 30% tax on the "ground rent" arising from power
production, with the central government and the counties receiving,
respectively, 95% and 5% of the take from this tax. Ground rent is
defined by the ministry as "the return on a natural resource over and
above a normal return... it is proposed to protect the normal return by
calculating an annual free income, which may be deducted from the
ground rent income".

* abolition of the present state production tax, which will be replaced
by the tax on the ground rent.

* the fixing of a minimum level for income tax [payable] to local
authorities (tax on hydro power income). "Hydro power income", says the
ministry, "is to be calculated separately for each individual power
plant for both publicly and privately [owned plants] as a proportion of
an estimated gross income. The aim of hydro power income is to ensure a
minimum level of stability in the income tax [take] of the hydro power
kommunes. It is proposed that hydro power income should be set at 35%
of the estimated gross income."

FOOTING THE NUCLEAR BILL

City lore has it that if the price is right you can sell anything.
Apply this to the UK's viable nuclear industry stripped of its Magnox
park, and the right price is obtained by prudently discounting a number
of factors - liabilities first, political and regulatory instability
next, perhaps public antipathy last. You are left with a business worth
considerably less than its newest, most prized asset, Sizewell B, which
cost #2.5bn.

Crudely put, this is the message coming from analysts, unions and
academics studying the government's plans to privatise Nuclear Electric
and Scottish Nuclear's merged AGR/PWR business as British Energy.
Public enthusiasm for the proposal, never high, has been diminished by
a perceived volte face by the government on its pledge to abolish the
Nuclear Levy on privatisation. The government's position is far from
stable; defections to opposing parties and a shrinking majority may yet
force it to take a more circumspect line on potentially divisive policy
decisions. Nevertheless, privatisation of nuclear and the railways
remain on the agenda.

With this as background, the Commons Trade and Industry Select
Committee investigating the nuclear proposal (PiE 213/4) is due to
report its findings on February 1. Among the most significant
contributions to the committee is a report* commissioned by Friends of
the Earth and the anti-nuclear local authority grouping COLA. It
suggests the government will be tempted to retain the #3bn ($4.658bn)
cost of reprocessing spent AGR fuel presently residing in the cooling
ponds of Sellafield to ensure the AGR/PWR business fetches something
like the #2.6bn value it has placed on it.

The report's authors, Gordon MacKerron of the Science Policy Research
Unit (SPRU) at Sussex University and Mike Sadnicki, a consultant, state
that such a scheme, while superficially attractive, is unsatisfactory
and possibly illegal under European Commission state aid rules.

Provisions in BE assets

The argument that the reprocessing costs constitute a historical legacy
and have nothing to do with the operation of a new company is
fallacious, the report says; "There are provisions in the accounts of
NE and SN of some #3.5bn to cover these liabilities for reprocessing
AGR fuel irradiated to 1995, and these provisions have in principle
been invested in the assets which British Energy will acquire. In other
words the assets contain the provisions for paying for the inherited
spent fuel. To exempt BE from the need to pay for them would be to
allow the company to enjoy the future incomes from the assets while
escaping a major liability which those assets are designed to pay for."

Exemption would result in the total public sector fund necessary to
assure payment of all liabilities growing from #7.8bn (the report's
estimated figure for a Magnox decom fund) to #10.35bn. This possibility
comes on top of regulator Stephen Littlechild's disclosure on December
19 that, despite perceived government promises to the contrary, the
Nuclear Levy will continue after privatisation in order to recover
around #450m of revenue arrears.

The announcement caused outcry from the Labour party, which branded the
government's promise of an 8% reduction in electricity bills "an
extravagance the government clearly can't afford to pay for".
Littlechild said the government had stated the levy would cease on
privatisation "subject to the recovery of outstanding arrears". The
Levy will remain at 10% on English and Welsh electricity bills from
April 1 1996 until privatisation, when a reduction in the rate is
anticipated. Energy minister Tim Eggar said power bills should fall by
6% by autumn 1996.

#809 million o.n.o.

So what value does the report put on BE's worth with all liabilities
factored in? MacKerron and Sadnicki's conventional base case using a 2%
discount rate on liabilities (the rate which the industry itself has
applied in the past) and a 13% discount rate on operational costs
values the company at -#2.6bn. Using a 13% discount rate on liabilities
and present costs - nearer the rate private investors are likely to use
when evaluating costs - the sale value is #809m.

The above cases have of necessity been partly based on statistical
assumptions given the shortage of operational data in the public
domain. BE itself is unable to comment in detail under the Financial
Services Act but was quoted as saying it would rather be judged on its
track record; indeed the report acknowledges the improvement in AGR
performance and Sizewell B's consistent operation at full power.
Neither is the report anti-privatisation per se; it concludes that if
it works well, the electricity market would be completed, some
liabilities would be transferred to the private sector and some cash
raised for the taxpayer. Analysts welcomed the attempt to detail the
industry's value but observers conceded there is as yet not enough core
data for the prudent investor.

If the approximations are at all accurate, the maximisation of the sale
value for nuclear power will almost certainly not correspond to the
division between Magnox and AGRs/PWR, the report continues. Assuming a
price of 2.5p/kWh, Heysham 2's estimated cash cost of 2.07p/kWh makes
it eminently privatisable. AGRs at Dungeness B and Hunterston B
(2.79p/kWh estimate) are not. "Quite probably a combination of Heysham
1 and 2, Torness, Sizewell B (and possibly Wylfa among the Magnox)
could all make money in the private sector, whereas Dungeness B,
Hartlepool, Hinkley Power B and Hunterston B might not", the report
says.

Add in the report's estimated 0.29p/kWh contribution to the independent
trust fund covering AGR decommissioning (PiE 213/5), and British Energy
is left with even fewer viable power stations. Of course, MacKerron and
Sadnicki could be wildly off the mark. After all, the report was partly
paid for by anti-nuclear pressure groups, as BE points out. SPRU,
however, has been near the mark in the past on the viability of new PWR
build and the desirability of a segregated decom fund.

AUSTRIAN ENERGY TAXES

The sudden change in finance ministers will delay but not derail plans
to introduce an energy (CO2) tax on electricity, gas and coal.
Regardless of the government's make up after the mid-December
elections, both the social democrats and conservative Volkspartei
favour extending the energy levy beyond motor fuels, taxed since last
May.

No one pretends any longer than the resultant funds would be applied to
CO2 reduction as originally intended; rather, the income would help
overcome a drastic budget deficit. Arguments have been flying over the
amount of tax to be levied (PiE 210/10) and this will be an ongoing
debate between the two parties as they attempt to reform the coalition
which came undone over budget issues last October. The conservatives
can be counted upon to hold back social democratic moves for a tax at
the higher end of the proposed scale, to avoid making Austria less
attractive for industry.

Coalition negotiations come first, but the energy tax could be a part
of the ultimate package. Nevertheless, given that formation of a new
government is not expected until the end of at least February,
introduction of the tax on electricity probably will not occur before
mid-year at the earliest.

OKA TO BE PARTIALLY PRIVATISED

Oberosterreich Kraftwerke AG (OKA) will be partially privatised this
year, according to the Upper Austrian provincial governor. Currently
the utility - which supplies the industrial centres of Linz and Steyr
as well as substantial agricultural areas with its own as well as
Verbund power - is wholly-owned by the province and, in addition, has a
36% holding in the Salzburg regional utility Salzburger AG fur
Energiewirtschaft (SAFE; PiE 192/12).

No date or procedure has been set for OKA privatisation, but any
arrangement is likely to include a condition which would avoid
shareholding by a German electricity utility: earlier moves to
partially privatise the Salzburg regional and municipal utilities
stumbled when a German purchase was feared. German utilities such as
Bayernwerk have made no secret of their interest in obtaining
transmission right-of-way across Austria, which would enable cheaper
electricity exchange between Germany and Italy.

Meanwhile, OKA has set major rationalisation and investment programmes
for the short-term future. Following a study by consultant AT Kearney,
OKA will reduce personnel from 2,410 to 2,000 through attrition.

Administration will be cut sharply, departments reduced from 60 to 38
and, local offices from 75 to 40. Savings in personnel costs over the
next six years are estimated in the "three figure millions", according
to management, with a Sch800m ($79.1m) cost reduction by 2001.

Growth, meanwhile, is expected from new business areas. The utility
will invest some Sch1.5bn in 1996, Sch1.1bn in plant and equipment, the
remainder in participation investments. The current major plant
investment is in the disputed Lambach generating facility (PiE 213/12).

REGULATION OF ELECTRICITY TARIFFS

The time-consuming procedures for altering electricity tariffs have
been simplified as of the start of this year. The new arrangement (PiE
211/12) allows utilities to institute tariff changes following
notification of the ministry for the economy. Detailed figures
supporting the change must be publicised and the adjustment justified.

The new regulation puts a cap on the amount of any increase and still
allows intervention by interest groups in Austria's "social
partnership" (labour, industry, agriculture) if the adjustments are
judged unwarranted. A 12% "deduction" from the gross increase is
required on the grounds that this amount must be achieved by the
utilities themselves through rationalisation. No increase may exceed
half of the then-current inflation rate.

For the arrangement to apply, individual utilities must agree to abide
by the new regulations. All nine of the country's regional utilities
plus the major municipal utilities have subscribed to the rules
governing the new procedure, but the responses of about 180 small
privately-owned electricity suppliers remains open.

The new arrangement has been criticised by the country's greens,
amongst others, who say the procedure gives utilities no more
initiative to introduce real cost-cutting or efficiencies, nor does it
subject tariff increases to the same scrutiny as did the previous
system.

RESULTS FROM THE FEDERAL VERBUND

High water flows through hydro plants and a 3% increase in electricity
consumption have assured a good year in 1995 for the federal Verbund.
The authority nevertheless has noted the impact of two major
cogeneration plants which have come on-line, measurably trimming
industrial electricity usage.

On the financial side, the Verbund last year experienced unbudgeted
costs of some Sch400m-500m ($39.6m-49.4m) when its long-term borrowings
in Swiss francs had to be revalued to reflect exchange rate
differences. About a fifth of Verbund bonds or Sch10bn are denominated
in francs. Notwithstanding, the Verbund will again pay its (49%)
private shareholders a 16% dividend based on the nominal Sch100 share
face value: this amounts to a 2.6% return relative to the year-end
market price of Sch606 per share. The government as 51% shareholder
will receive an 8% dividend on its stake, or half the private
shareholders' return.

No detailed export-import figures have been released, but the Verbund
notes an export surplus in its electricity trading for 1995. Higher
sales to Germany, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary have been registered,
although in part these have been achieved at below-cost prices in order
to reduce untenable coal stockpiles (PiE 214/14). Exports to Eastern
Europe made a profit of Sch500m last year, according to management.

Faced with a surplus of electricity as well as generating capacity, the
Verbund has succeeded in cancelling import contracts with the Ukraine,
postponing for another year an exchange contract with Russia and
suspending for five years a 500 GWh contract with Bayernwerk which was
to have come into effect last October. Verbund director Johannes
Sereinig estimates that these moves will save the federal authority
some Sch300-350m annually. At the same time, however, the Verbund has
been unsuccessful in negotiating changes to its 20-year 1,200 GWh
supply contract with Hungary (PiE 213/12) and has begun importing
unwanted and expensive electricity under the terms of the 1986 deal.

VERBUND PARTICIPATION IN RETAIL MARKETS

Regional utilities which have opposed federal Verbund participation in
their retail markets will not be comforted by recent statements by
Verbund director Hans Haider.

"Our direction heads toward heavier participation in the regional
utilities", Haider stated, underlining that the Verbund will "seek to
secure the market" rather than allow intrusion by powerful German
utilities.

"Were Bayernwerk last year to have acquired a holding in Kelag
[regional utility], we'd also now have them in [the generating utility]
Drauwerke", Haider argues. Kelag has a 49% holding in Drauwerke;
intervention by the Verbund last year pre-empted a bid by Bayernwerk
for a controlling holding in Kelag (PiE 185/11).

Next on the Verbund shopping list is STEWEAG, the regional utility
sharing supply to Styria, which could be partially privatised once
ownership in the provincially-owned concern is transferred to a holding
group. The Verbund already controls STEG, the other utility serving the
province, which it acquired in 1992 from Swiss owners (PiE 138/9) in
the face of strong protest from STEWEAG and other regional utilities.

While the Verbund sees greater involvement in Styria as bringing
considerable potential for efficiency, other regional utilities fear
that the federal organisation is seeking to ensure its future at their
expense while protecting itself against divestiture under EU rules of
its import-export and transmission grid monopolies. Haider has
justified wider Verbund shareholding in regional utilities on grounds
that this assures Austrian control over energy polices.

SALE OF SHARES IN VIW CHALLENGED

The sale of shares in Vorarlberger Illwerke (VIW) by the federal
government to the province of Vorarlberg has been challenged by Swiss
minority (4.5%) shareholder Finelectra. The Swiss concern asserts that
the deal between Vorarlberg and the Ministry of Finance for transfer of
user rights to VIW's high-voltage transmission lines (PiE 207/11) is
illegal as it was not put to shareholders.

Vorarlberg officials have registered surprise at the suit since talks
were held with Finelectra shortly before conclusion of the purchase
deal. Details of the Swiss charge are not known, but the challenge has
been dismissed by Vorarlberg's provincial governor as having no
significance.

AUSTRIAN UTILITIES TO ESTABLISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK

Austrian electricity utilities have pledged to band together to
establish a ground-based telecommunications network. The decision
follows the failure of either of the consortia in which they had an
interest (PiE 213/12) to win the single mobile telecoms license award.

Both Energieversorgung Niederosterreich (EVN) and the federal Verbund
had been reasonably certain that consortia in which they were
participants would gain the mobile telephone license. Both lost, with
the franchise going instead to a group supported mainly by the German
DeTe Mobil concern, Siemens Austria and the Austrian bank BAWAG.

The electricity utilities now plan to concentrate on development of
their fixed-based facilities with transmission via glass fibre cables
suspended from their high-voltage distribution pylons, in anticipation
of the anticipated telecoms liberalisation in 1998.

SLUMP IN POWER CONSUMPTION IN BELGIUM

Preliminary figures released by the Belgian federation of electricity
producers and distributors (FEB) show a slump in power consumption in
Belgium in 1995 from September, reflecting the wider cooling in
Europe's economy. Net power consumption in the country grew by an
estimated 2.9% last year compared to growth of 4.9% in 1994, said FEB.
In volume terms, net consumption in 1995 was 69,821 GWh versus 67,822
GWh in 1994.

Most of the slowdown was attributed to plunging demand from industry.
Though demand for energy from the sector remained strong during the
first half of the year (5.4%), it tapered off sharply after the summer,
leading to growth in industrial consumption for the year as a whole of
3.7%, or slightly less than in 1994. Demand from Belgium's domestic
sector grew by a moderate 2.0% last year, while its tertiary (services)
sector saw consumption grow by 2.4%.

Net production rose by 3%, from 68,563 GWh in 1994 to 70,605 GWh last
year, according to FEB. As usual, Belgium's private sector accounted
for the overwhelming share of production: 64,943 GWh or nearly 92% of
the total. Public utilities accounted for 4.2%, while the balance of
3.8% came from auto-producers.

Nuclear energy was the largest fuel source, generating 39,063 GWh last
year or 55.3% of total power production. This was followed by solid
fuels (22.9%), natural gas and gas derivatives (17.8%), liquid fuels
(1.5%), hydro-power (1.8%) and recovered steam (0.7%).

Belgium's fuel mix for electricity produced in 1995 saw the greatest
changes in the natural gas and liquid fuel categories. Use of natural
gas and derivatives last year to produce electricity, for example, shot
up by 19.4% compared to 1994. Indeed, according to the country's gas
federation, sales of natural gas to Belgium's power sector ballooned by
20.9% from 70,151 TJ in 1994 to 84,800 TJ last year.

Though its absolute share is minuscule, power derived from recovered
steam rose 18.9% compared to 1994 (523 GWh vs 440 GWh). Nuclear energy
saw its share in total production rise slightly by 1.4%, reversing the
trend of recent years. Liquid fuels and wind power fell sharply (22.6%
and 11.1%, respectively).

Separately, FEB said the sector imported a total of 9,416 GWh from
France, Luxembourg and Holland last year and exported a total of 5,307
GWh, leaving a net balance of imported power of 4,109 GWh. Belgium had
a net balance of imports of 3,983 GWh in 1994.

One gas-fired co-generation unit of 51 MW was put into service at Ham,
near Ghent, in 1995 while a scattering of small steam-power units went
into service at Brugges (0.44 MW), Bressoux (3 0.9 MW units), Deurne
(0.76 MW), Harelbeke (0.165 MW) Middelkerke (0.165 MW) and at Wanze
(0.23 MW and 0.31 MW). As part of Belgium's current ten year (1988-
1998) plan, two 350 MW gas-fired co-generation stations will be put
into service at Ghent and Brugges in 1997.

The country's next equipment plan for the 1995-2005 period, which was
given final government approval on December 20, places even greater
accent on natural gas-fired stations. It also calls for a reduction in
the growth of demand for electricity of 0.9% for the coming year and
lower tariffs, starting in the second trimester of 1996.

FEB said Belgium's electricity grid expanded modestly in most
categories: 0.5 km for 220 kV lines, 3.3 km for 150 kV lines and 15.8
km for 70 kV lines, including 13.8 km of cable. Total capital
investments in production, transport and distribution activities was
Bfr 35.6bn($1.205bn) or nearly 17% more than in 1994 (Bfr 30.5bn).
Electricity prices during the year rose with inflation, or by
approximately 1.5%.

DANISH CHP REPORT

Elsam's recent report to the Danish Energy Council - Integrated
Resource Planning - struck a far from sanguine note. It claims Denmark
is heading towards a major imbalance between electricity production and
consumption. Elsam reckons that 40% of the power produced by wind
turbines and CHP units in 1998 will be superfluous to local consumer
requirements. The company predicts that Danish electricity oversupply
will reach a massive 1,000 GW in four year's time.

Elsam lays the blame with what it calls a "too rapid and uncontrolled
development of CHP" in Denmark. After a heated and very public argument
between the Danish energy minister, Svend Auken, and Elsam in the weeks
leading up to Christmas, Elsam agreed to accept power from 64 new small
decentralised CHP units. When completed, they will have a combined
capacity of 1,225 MW, or about one-fourth of Elsam's entire capacity at
present.

The Danish Energy Council (controlled by the energy ministry) believes
there is scope for 1,500 MW of CHP-produced electricity in the region.
Elsam insists there is no need to build a single new CHP unit before
2003 at the earliest, and says that state operating support for CHP -
Dkr 0.10/kWh ($0.018) and 30% capital construction grants - has
encouraged far too many investors.

Politicians and Elsam have been at odds about the small decentralised
power plants since parliament first decided to promote them vigorously
towards the end of the 1980s. The decision was made on the basis of
several reports which suggested that CHP and biofuel formed the most
eco-friendly solution to Denmark's electricity needs. However, their
opponents now claim that a major disadvantage with CHP is that there is
no central dispatch system co-ordinating them. Electricity production
by CHP is dictated by the need for heat and this means they produce at
full capacity in the winter months while the larger centrally-placed
power plants are forced to cut back on production.

One result of the CHP argument is the resumption of the debate on
connecting Denmark's two separate East and West grids. In 1992
parliament urged Elsam and its Eastern Denmark counterpart, Elkraft, to
work towards establishing a cable to join their grids. As yet, however,
the plan has come to nothing. New calculations on the economic
viability of the plan show that income derived from inter-regional
electricity sales would only meet the ordinary operating costs of a new
cable.

Income would thus be insufficient to pay the estimated Dkr90m interest
associated with the capital costs of the project. However, energy
minister Svend Auken has requested the Energy Council to undertake an
additional assessment of the project. He accepts that the capital costs
would be high, but "it would be a once-off investment which would give
us a great advantage in the coming European energy market", he
concluded. On a more up-beat note, the Elsam reports says it expects to
achieve its targeted CO2 emission reduction five years earlier than the
government had anticipated.

According to the government's energy policy law Energy 2000, Danish
power producers must cut total CO2 emissions to a maximum of 24m tons
per annum by 2005. Elsam claims western Denmark's targeted 14m tons can
be achieved as early as 2000.

ELECTRICITY INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN ITALY AND GREECE

The European Commission is setting aside more than Ecu 75m ($98.1m) to
improve electricity interconnections between Italy and Greece. The
grant, approved on January 11, will be financed from the EU's Regional
Funds and forms part of the "INTERREG II" programme.

The lion's share of the money - Ecu55.772m - goes to Greece, with the
balance of Ecu20m for Italy. It will be used to strengthen power
distribution links between the two countries, notably between the 400
kW electricity supply networks that link Arachthos in Greece to
Galatina in Italy.

Two AC to DC conversion stations will be built, along with a line to
carry direct current to connect the two stations. The money will also
fund the installation of a 160 km underwater cable to carry 600 MW
between Oporto Badisco in Italy and the Greek town of Aetos.

ENERGY TAXES

The Commission approved on December 20 a set of Dutch fiscal measures
designed to encourage energy savings and a reduction of CO2 emissions.
The centrepiece of the legislation is an energy tax on small-scale
energy consumers.

The tax will be levied on consumption of the first 50,000 kWh of
electricity and the first 170,000 cubic metres of natural gas. Only
small-scale energy consumers - mainly households and small businesses -
are subject to the tax.

The revenues will be channelled back to taxpayers via a reduction in
direct taxes on capital and labour income, thus constituting a "tax
neutral" mechanism. Large-scale electricity users are exempt from the
tax, as other measures apply to them. Similarly, Holland's
"horticulture under glass" - ie, its sizeable agricultural and flower-
growing sector - is exempt from the tax on gas consumption in order to
maintain its competitive footing internationally.

The Dutch government says its will amend its legislation if a common,
EU-wide CO2/energy tax is introduced.

CGT CALLS FOR FRESH ACTION

The French CGT (Confederation Generale du Travail) trade union called
on its members at Electricite de France (EdF)-Gaz de France (GdF) to
undertake fresh action on January 9 and 11. The latest protests were
aimed at the decision to hold back salary increases this year to 0.7%.

The government has issued instructions to all state-owned firms, as
well as official bodies to hold salaries back in line with an official
target of 2% for inflation. All that EdF-GdF has so far promised its
workforce is an end of year bonus which will increase pay by 0.7% from
1995 levels.

Earlier this year, the CGT was trying to relaunch general protests
aimed at preserving "public service" and the state employees' slightly
privileged pension systems, which were interrupted by a truce over
Christmas. This met with very little support. According to management
figures, no more than 1% or 2% of the utilities' employees backed them;
the four other main unions - FO, CFDT, CGC, and CFTC - did not support
the protests. They were content with the pension guarantees that they
had obtained, and with the delay that had been imposed on liberalising
Europe's power supply system.

* EdF is to pay the state a dividend of Ffr1.5bn for 1995, while Gaz de
France is to pay Ffr970m, according to figures published in the
official journal.

FRENCH WINDPOWER PILOT PROGRAMME

A working group on renewable energy sources has proposed that the
French government buy between 250 MW-500 MW of wind turbine generators
to connect to the grid.  The proposal is being considered by the
government.

Director of energy and raw materials at the industry ministry, Claude
Mandil, noted that ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise
de l'Energie), as well as the turbine manufacturers wanted to install
500 MW by 2005, while Electricite de France would prefer 250 MW with a
first tranche of 50 MW.

He added that wind turbines had made considerable technical progress in
recent years and were becoming increasingly competitive.

A committee of experts would supervise the proposed pilot programme.
Tenders would be carried out in stages, allowing the project managers
to benefit from experience in the preceding rounds. Operators would
probably be asked to tender on the basis of the electricity purchase
price that EdF would have to offer to make their proposal viable.

LA MANCHE NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP

France's environment ministry has confirmed that an independent
scientific commission is being set up to supervise the La Manche
nuclear waste dump near La Hague.

Activity at the centre has been in abeyance since November 30, when the
appeal court in Caen ruled that it must be stopped. The court was faced
with a plea by ecological groups arguing that the site was not
functioning properly. The court is due to rule on January 31 whether on
work at the centre can resume.

ANDRA, the nuclear waste agency which manages the site, stopped
stocking additional materials in 1994, and had almost finished covering
the site - with a view to monitoring it for 300 years - when the court
order to stop intervened.

FUEL CONSUMPTION IN ITALIAN POWER STATIONS

Figures for fuel consumption in Italian power stations in the first
nine months of last year show increased gross thermal production, 8.9%
higher at 143,203 GWh than in the comparable 1994 period, compensating
for the 12.0% fall in hydro production to 31,920 GWh.

While gross production from coal increased sharply by 30.7% to 17,444
GWh, it, nevertheless, only provided 12.2% of total gross thermal
production. Fuel oil continued to dominate the Italian scene. Although
gross production from fuel oil increased by a modest 2.3%, from 83,341
GWh in the first nine months of 1994 to 85,265 GWh in the same period
last year, it accounted for 59.5% of gross thermal production.

Natural gas maintained its clear second place, recording an advance of
15.8% in gross production to 33,917 GWh, equivalent to 23.7% of total
gross thermal production. Other fuels used in Italy's thermal power
plant provided gross production of 6,577 GWh during January to
September last year, an increase of 19.2% on 1994 and equivalent to
4.6% of the total.

In terms of consumption, Italy's thermal power plants burnt 18.38mt of
fuel oil between January and September last year (up 2.8% on the same
period of 1994), 8.27 Bcm of natural gas (plus 19.1%) and 5.95mt of
imported coal (plus 28.8%). The statistics show that there was no
consumption of indigenous coal.

ENEL RAISES INTERNATIONAL PROFILE

State corporation ENEL raised its international profile over Christmas
by providing 300 kW illumination modules for lighting the holy places
in Bethlehem.

Following an approach from the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO),
ENEL decided that equipment from its 'Luce per l'Arte' programme should
be made available to light up the Basilica of the Nativity, the grotto
and the walls of Bethlehem's square. The illumination project ran from
Christmas Eve until January 8, the date of the Islamic new year. In the
season of goodwill, ENEL hopes that its Bethlehem illumination project
will help to bring some business to its international project workload.

The corporation has had discussions with the PLO about electrification
work in the former Israeli occupied territories, and will try to use
the presence of its 'Luce per l'Arte' modules in Bethlehem as a lever
to keep the door open for a successful Palestinian crusade by its
engineering division.

The marketing possibilities of other 'Luce per l'Arte' initiatives
undertaken by ENEL over Christmas and the new year are less obvious.
Since the autumn, the Vittorio Emanuele monument in the capital's
Piazza Venezia has been floodlit by ENEL's modules, and at the other
end of the Via del Corso, the Piazza del Popolo was specially
illuminated for New Year's eve festivities. At the beginning December,
a tailor-made 35 kW fixed but programmable lighting system comprising
259 lamps was switched on in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere.
Thanks to ENEL's intervention, visitors are now better able to
appreciate the basilica's XIIIth century mosaics and XVIIth century
ceiling.

Earlier this week, the buildings in the Campidoglio capitoline hill
area of the capital and the nearby Roman fori were illuminated by ENEL
for ceremonies inaugurating the start of Italy's European Union
presidency. Perhaps ENEL, whose privatisation plans have earnt
criticism from the Brussels competition authorities, wanted to cock a
snook at the Commission's chairman Jacques Santer and his commissioner
colleagues who were in Rome. Or, by bringing a sparkle to the capital,
the state electricity corporation may have been offering thanks to
Lamberto Dini's government which has allowed ENEL to avoid the
privatisation upheavals that would have been likely under a less
complaisant government.

EDF WITH EDISON PURCHASE 75% OF ISE

Continuing its international acquisitions, Electricite de France (EdF)
has completed the purchase of 75% of the Italian electricity producer
Ilva Servizi Energie (ISE), in partnership with Edison. The two firms
paid L370bn ($233m) for their stake, which will be held through a joint
company called Finel, in which Edison has 60% and EdF 40%. The deal was
agreed conditionally at the beginning of 1995, but the conditions were
not met until towards the end of last year.

EdF commented that this was an important step in developing
collaborations with other power generators in countries which wanted to
encourage independent electricity producers.

ISE already has capacity of some 600 MW, including a thermal power
station at Taranto (in Puglia), two at Piombino (in Tuscany), and a
hydro power plant at Terni (in Umbria). In addition, ISE is building a
500 MW thermal power station at Taranto, which will be fired with gases
from the blast furnaces of the local steelworks.  It will use combined
cycles to generate both electricity, which will be sold to ENEL, and
steam, which will be used by the steelworks. The project is due to come
into operation in the second half of 1996.

DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY IN THE NETHERLANDS

Demand for electricity in the Netherlands peaked at an all time high of
11,160 MW on December 20 last year, but overall demand of 70 TWh was
down 0.4% or 300 GWh on 1994, according to provisional figures from
SEP, the Dutch central electricity generating board.

SEP said the 1995 peak was 3.3% higher than the previous year's figure
and the first time demand passed the 11 GW mark.

SEP supplied 90% of the power provided through the national grid, with
the remaining 10% coming from combined heat/power plants owned by
industry and energy distributors.

SEP generators produced 2% less electricity last year, reflecting a
rise in power imports, which accounted for 17% of SEP's output compared
to 15% in 1994. At the same time, SEP exports increased four-fold to
320 GWh in 1995 from 75 GWh in 1994.

The steady advance in the share of power generated from coal continued
last year, climbing to 45% from 42% in 1994 and 37% in 1993, SEP said.
The share of natural gas declined further, to 49% from 525 in 1994 and
57% in 1993. Nuclear power accounted for 6% of production, the same as
in previous years.

SEP's total production capacity fell to 14,44 MW last year, 590 MW down
on 1994. Heat supplies from power stations expanded by 1% to 13,997 TJ
in 1995 from 13,773 TJ a year earlier.

SEP said the fuel component in the national basic tariff (LBT) had been
fixed at DFl 0.052 ($0.032) per kWh for daytime production and DFl
0.044 for night-time production for the first quarter of this year. The
night-time tariff is DFl 0.001 lower than in the last quarter of 1995,
while the daytime rate is unchanged.

PNEM SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH WINDFARMERS

Southern Dutch energy distributor PNEM has signed a ten-year agreement
with Windfarmers BV in Moerdijk for the supply of electricity for its
Green Power scheme under which customers can opt to buy electricity
generated from renewable sources (PiE 201/15). Windfarmers will build
four wind turbines, each with a capacity of 1 MW, which will deliver a
total of around 6 GWh of power annually, starting in March next year.

PNEM was the first company to introduce the Green Power programme in
the Netherlands and has won 2,500 clients since the scheme was launched
in June. The company hopes to increase this to 10,000 by the end of
next year.

Customers currently pay Dfl 0.085 ($0.053) more per kWh for
electricity, but this will drop to around Dfl 0.05 when the new eco tax
is introduced on January 1 according to the government's proposals.

* PNEM has announced a Dfl 0.0024 price rise for its conventional
electricity to Dfl 0.1912 (up Dfl0.0047 to Dfl 0.2382 for peak periods
ie 07.00-21.00).

NORWEGIAN-SWEDISH POWER BOURSE

The difference between Norwegian and Swedish power prices has been
shrinking since the Norwegian-Swedish power bourse began functioning on
January 1 - creating what is claimed to be the world's first
international power bourse (PiE 212/20).

From that day, Swedish traders have been able to buy and sell on the
market - operated by Statnett Marked and located at Lysaker, on the
outskirts of Oslo - regardless of whether their companies have the
physical infrastructure needed to import and export electricity between
the two countries. Previously, this was a condition of their being
allowed to do business there.

On January 2, the first working day of the year, 20 Swedish players
traded on the market, according to Hans Randen, a director of Statnett
Marked. This compared to only nine before the new year. January 1,
moreover, saw the abolition of border tariffs charged on power
exchanges between the two countries. Power exchanges between Norway and
Finland and Norway and Denmark are still subject to these tariffs;
apart from this, however, Finnish and Danish traders can operate on the
bourse under the same terms as the Swedes and Norwegians. "We expect
that most of the trade will take place in the day market, and that this
will lead to increased liquidity", Randen told the Oslo business daily
Dagens Naeringsliv.

He predicted that by the end of the year there would be some 40-50
Swedish players dealing on the joint bourse, in addition to the
approximately 100 Norwegians already using it. According to Per Hjorth,
managing director of Statnett Marked, the latter include around 40
generating utilities, 40 distributing utilities, eight to ten
industrial companies and ten brokers.

Power volumes traded via Statnett Marked rose to some 38 TWh in 1995,
from 28 TWh in 1994. Average annual output capacity in Norway is 112
TWh.

"I believe we shall reach 50 TWh this year, and much of the volume
growth will of course be due to the new joint market with Sweden", said
Randen.

PRIVATISATION OF ELECTRICIDADE DE PORTUGAL

Officials of Portugal's new Socialist government have indicated changes
in the way Electricidade de Portugal (EdP) is to be privatised. But
apparent contradictions in their announcements remain to be clarified.
Economics Minister Daniel Bessa told a Lisbon newspaper the first step
in privatising the group would involve finding major institutional
investors willing to buy up to 50% of an initial offer.

Secretary of State for Energy Jose Penedos was quoted as saying the
government plans a gradual privatisation of the group as a whole,
rather than in parts, and intends to disperse the capital widely. He
said this would help stimulate capital markets and make the purchase of
shares more accessible to Portuguese investors.

The previous centre-right government had planned to privatise up to 49%
of Companhia Portuguesa de Producao Electrica (CPPE), the production
arm of the EdP group, and subsequently sell up to 49% of the country's
four regional distribution companies. Penedos said the limit would
remain at 49%. More details are expected when the government presents
its overall privatisation programme, due towards the end of January.

The new government also plans to change the regulatory system for the
power sector approved in mid-1995, making the regulatory body set up
for the industry responsible for energy issues as a whole, not just for
the electricity sector. Penedos said the scope for government
intervention in the regulation of the energy sector would also be
reduced but gave no further details. In particular, the new government
wants the regulatory body to cover natural gas, due to be introduced in
Portugal by 1997.

Meanwhile, EdP has announced price cuts for industrial and commercial
users of 5%-8% in nominal terms in 1996. Taking account of expected
inflation, this represents a reduction in real terms of 8.5%-11.5%,
says EDP. Prices are to be 5% lower during peak hours and 8% lower at
other times. Prices for domestic consumers will be held flat in nominal
terms in 1996. EdP also forecasts its 1995 profits will double from
1994's Es30.5bn ($203.9m).

HEAVY RAIN FILLS PORTUGAL'S HYDRO-ELECTRIC DAMS

Weeks of heavy rain after five years of drought have filled Portugal's
hydro-electric dams to the extent that production has had to be halted
at several plants. All five hydro units on the Douro river in the
north, the country's most important source of hydro power, were shut
down in mid-January because the dams were too full to produce the
required fall of water to drive the turbines that produce energy.
However, annual production was expected to be above average in 1996
after current high water levels subsided.

More than half of Portugal's 64 dams were reported full and some were
discharging water to reduce excess capacity. All but four of the 24
hydroelectric dams belonging to Rede Electrica Nacional, the state-
owned national power grid operator, were full.

Three people died in accidents as parts of Lisbon and other regions
were flooded in the second week of January. The Tagus river overflowed
its banks in the area of Santarem 80 kms north of Lisbon. Portuguese
authorities were monitoring the river upstream in Spain, concerned that
the heavy rains could force Spanish reservoirs to discharge water,
aggravating Portugal's difficulties.

Officials said Portugal's five years of drought were over but the
ability to meet irrigation requirements fully next spring would depend
on rainfall in January and February. Rainfall in the southern Alentejo
region over the past two months was more than in the previous four
years and risks of flooding continued in several regions of Portugal.

SPAIN'S 1996 ELECTRICITY TARIFFS FROZEN

Spain's 1996 electricity tariffs have been frozen for the first time
since 1973. The utilities' association Unesa said the tariff freeze was
"the electricity sector's contribution to the stability of the economy
and the general price index," although Unesa chairman Martin Gonzalez
del Valle said that the tariff had fallen 10.7% in real terms since the
Stable Legal Framework (MLE) was first approved in 1984.

The MLE allows the utilities to factor certain costs - such as asset
costs, some overheads and hydroelectric generation costs - into their
tariff rates.

The December 28 decree which set the 1996 tariff also modified the MLE
in order to cut the utilities' income by Pta29.2bn ($241.3m), or 1.42%
of the tariff, but this will be made up by making other adjustments
according to interest and exchange rates.

The industry ministry's MLE modifications are broadly in line with
those proposed in November by the regulatory body, the National
Electricity Commission (CSEN), which wants to see more competition in
the sector.

The tariff increase has been below inflation for the past five years -
in 1995 it rose an average of 1.48% on inflation an estimated 3.5%.
this year's inflation forecast is also 3.5%. Unesa said on January 5
that between 1959 and 1995 the average price of electricity had fallen
by 39% in comparison with the consumer price index rise over the same
35 year period.

Days earlier, European commissioner for competition Karel van Miert had
told the European Parliament's Foreign Economic Relations Commission
that Spain's electricity tariffs were the highest in the EU.

The industry ministry has also bowed to consumer groups' pressure and
agreed to a new electricity bill which for the first time will contain
information on the client's consumption over the past 12 months, the
average cost per day in that period, as well as the percentage paid
from the bill for domestic coal subsidies, and to subsidise the
utilities' nuclear moratorium debt.

The latter two, being fixed rates, penalise higher consumption. The
1996 percentages, based on the estimated 1995 tariff turnover of Pta2
trillion and a forecast 1996 growth of 3.65% are the same as in 1995 -
3.54% or Pta72.6bn in nuclear moratorium debt, and 4.86% or Pta99.8bn
in coal subsidies.

Unesa said the new invoice model is designed to separate the direct
production costs - supply, generation and maintenance - from the
external and political costs such as the nuclear debt and subsidies.

Announcing the MLE changes, industry minister Juan Manuel Eguiagaray
said the electricity sector would not have to make investments in new
generation until at least 2000. But he said some fuel oil-fired power
stations would be converted to gas. "By February we shall authorise the
conversion to gas of fuel-oil stations with a capacity of 1,400 MW."

ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IN SPAIN

Industry association Unesa's provisional figures show that electricity
consumption increased by 3.8% in 1995. High-tension industrial
consumption grew by almost 6%, consumption in services and commerce was
up by 2%, while domestic demand fell by 1.5%.

Total consumption last year was 149,834 GWh, while generation was up
2.6% at 168,686 GWh. The fourth year of the century's worst drought
meant that hydroelectric generation fell by 16.8% at 23,968 GWh,
although it shot up in the last two weeks of the year as Spain
experienced almost constant rain from November. Unesa estimates that
the drought resulted in hydro generation at 30% lower than in normal
conditions, costing the utilities more than Pta50bn ($413.2m) in lost
production.

Thermal generation rose by 11.1% over 1994 to reach 89,276 GWh, which
Unesa said was an all-time high, while nuclear generation was up by
0.2% at 55,442 GWh. Spain increased its imports from France by 250%,
and total imports stood at 7,623 GWh, while exports were 3,145 GWh.
Together, imports and exports rose by 143.6%.

BASQUE PLANS TO ACHIEVE ENERGY SELF-SUFFICIENCY

The Basque regional government in northern Spain has warned that it is
"very seriously" studying plans to develop an independent gas-fired
electricity system if the industry ministry in Madrid continues to
block its plan to achieve energy self-sufficiency.

In an interview with the financial daily Expansion, Basque industry
minister Javier Retegi reminded Madrid that the existence of
independent operators outside the integrated electricity system is
enshrined in the government's own year-old Electricity Sector Law
(Losen), even though certain regulatory norms have not been fully
developed.

Retegi's comments are bound to increase tension between the Basque
capital Vitoria and Madrid, which opposes much of the Basque project
such as the conversion of the unfinished Lemoniz nuclear power station
into a combined cycle plant on the grounds that Spain does not
currently need new energy sources.

Euskadi (Basque Country) retorts that it wants self-sufficiency because
it feels that it is at the end of the 'energy line' in the far north,
and it wants to diversify its sources of primary energy, mainly gas. It
is no secret that the Basque nationalists who control the regional
government want energy autonomy as well as political autonomy.

Ironically, the development of independent operations outside the
integrated system is very much in line with the government's plans to
introduce greater liberalisation and competition in the sector. The
problem is that the Basque energy plan is in contrast with the industry
ministry's national plans.

Under the Basque government's Estrategia Energetica de Euskadi, or Plan
3E, the Basque Country would generate 42% of its own electricity by
2000. At the moment, it 'imports' 85% of this energy from outside the
region. Retegi claims that 10% of electricity is lost in transport.

"Our goal of electricity self-sufficiency is quite reasonable", he
says. "We are already negotiating with various foreign companies who
specialise in gas, electricity and independent systems, such as Enron
and Mitsubishi."

Basque energy independence would be based on four gas-fired electricity
generation stations, only one of which is currently on-line. This is
the 360 MW Santurtzi fuel-oil plant which would be converted to
combined cycle operation.

The uncompleted Lemoniz nuclear plant would be converted into a 300 MW
combined cycle plant. Construction was halted in 1982 after ETA
separatist gunmen killed two engineers at the plant, two years before
Spain's nuclear construction moratorium came into effect.

A further two gas-fired generators are to be built - Zabalgarbi, two 90
MW units, and Zergarbi, with a single 90 MW unit.

Retegi said natural gas consumption would rise from the current 15% to
29% of total primary energy use by 2000, which would mean building a
regasification plant in Bilbao port and connection to the French gas
network. "the interconnection between gas and electricity obliges us to
develop a global energy scenario", he says.

"If we had a good understanding with central Administration to achieve
greater self-sufficiency, to use Lemoniz and to guarantee [alternative]
gas supplies, everything would be in order and it would not be
necessary to seek alternatives to the integrated system", concluded
Retegi.

acquisition of Hidruna with the purchase of 30% from Iberdrola, 15
months ahead of schedule. The Grupo Enher, which with Hidruna includes
Termicos del Besos, is now complete and in 1995 had a combined turnover
in excess of Pta200bn ($1.7bn).

Iberdrola agreed to sell Hidruna to Endesa through Enher in a 1993
asset-swap, but the remaining 30% was to have been acquired in two
stages by March 1997. The Pta21.7bn deal was brought forward because of
the healthy situation of both Enher and Hidruna.

THIRD WIND FARM AT TARIFA

A third wind farm has been commissioned at Spain's wind power capital
of Tarifa in the far south. The Pta1bn ($8.3m) farm was built by Planta
Eolica Europea (Peesa), a group led by Danish company Nordtank (44%),
Danish engineering firm Elsam Project (44%), and Spain's Sevillana de
Electricidad (12%). The farm's 12 x 500 kW air turbines have a combined
installed capacity of 6 MW.

Sevillana is active in all three wind farms, which have a combined
capacity of 66 MW. It holds 23% of Sociedad Eolica de Andalucia, and 9%
of kW Tarifa.

Spain could be the world's second wind power producer by 2000,
according to energy secretary general Alberta Lafuente who was
presenting the four-year Pta16bn energy research Plan Estela, which
will investigate all areas of energy generation.

The industry ministry announced that the capacity of all renewable
energies had increased by 80% in the past five years in Spain and
stands at 407 MW. Including hydro generation, renewable energies
accounted for 5% of the national total. Oil accounts for 54%, coal for
19%, nuclear power 15%, and gas 7%. Although wind power has increased
tenfold since 1990, it still accounts for only 0.2% of renewable energy
and 0.01% of all energy generated.

SPAIN'S NUCLEAR MORATORIUM DEBT

The government has finally approved a Royal Decree that will solve the
problem of the Pta729bn ($6.02bn) nuclear moratorium debt. The debt has
been borne by three utilities since construction was frozen in 1984 on
five nuclear power stations in Spain, one year after the Electricity
Sector Law (Losen) incorporated the means to clear the debt.

Losen enshrined the right of Iberdrola (Pta540bn), Sevillana de
Electricidad (Pta178bn) and Union Fenosa (Pta11bn) to receive
compensation for their investments in the plants either through a 3.54%
share of the tariff, with the debt paid off within 25 years, or the
right to pass on to investors the chance to gain the compensation in
the form of securities.

The decree ensures that the State gives a triple guarantee to the
utilities or, in their place, the investors. First, a minimum annual
compensation is guaranteed via the utilities' turnover; second, the
state will make up any difference remaining after 25 years; and third,
the state guarantees to cover the interests incurred by the debts.

* Union Fenosa has reduced its financial debt by Pta30.7bn to
Pta507.4bn. Some 19.3% of this is in foreign reserves, lower than the
average for the sector.

Spain's third largest telephone paging company, Compania Europea de
Radiobusqueda (Cersa), in which each holds a 9% stake.

Endesa and Sevillana have also broken ranks with Spain's largest
private utility Iberdrola by leaving the telecommunications holding
company Secomtel that they formed in the late 1980s. Iberdrola, which
holds 16% of Cersa signalled its intention to stay in the
telecommunications sector by announcing plans to purchase 40-50% of the
Internet connection company Servicom.

The three utilities have operated in telephone paging since 1992
through the consortium Servicio de Radiotelefonia Movil (SRM), which
holds 96% of Cersa. Secomtel's shares will be divided between SRM and
another mobile telephone company, Teletrunk.

The main reasons for the break-up are the different strategies being
undertaken by Endesa - which has joined forces with Banco Santander and
Banco Central Hispano - and Iberdrola, which appears to be moving
toward an alliance with semi-public telecommunications giant
Telefonica.

Endesa and Sevillana are also moving out of SRM/Cersa for economic
reasons. The late arrival of the paging service in Spain meant that
three large operators with important investors emerged in 1992 just as
the more successful mobile telephone sector was taking off.

This meant that Cersa, with 25,000 clients, lost Pta420m ($3.5m) last
year. A leading contender to purchase the 27% of SRM shares on offer is
Sistelcom-Telemensaje, a consortium which includes two other utilities,
Union Fenosa and Fecsa.

ENDESA TO BUILD SPAIN'S BIGGEST DESALINATION PLANT

Public utility Endesa is heading a consortium that is to build Spain's
biggest desalination plant on the southern Costa del Sol at Marbella.
The Pta7bn plant will be able to desalinate 60,000 cm of seawater a day
and it is scheduled to begin operating this summer.

The consortium consists of Endesa with 25%, its affiliate Sevillana de
Electricidad (25%), Aguas de Barcelona (10%), and construction company
Lain (40%). The project is part of Endesa's diversification plans, and
will not serve for cogeneration purposes.

IBERDROLA TO PURCHASE STAKE IN EUSKALTEL

Iberdrola is to purchase a 10% stake in the Basque telecommunications
and cable television company Euskaltel before the end of the year.
Euskaltel is currently owned 40% by the Basque regional government,
with the rest in the hands of the three Basque savings banks.
Iberdrola, based in the Basque city of Bilbao, is Spain's second-
biggest utility.

AUTOPRODUCTION IN SWITZERLAND

Autoproducers in Switzerland will continue to benefit from federal
tariff recommendations until end-1998. These have been in force since
mid-1993, have now been extended until the end of 1998. As Switzerland
has few industrial autoproducers, the scheme mainly benefits small
hydro producers and gas-fired CHP plant in buildings.

According to an Evaluation Report just published, 80% of small hydro
plant (less than 300 kW) surveyed have seen the prices paid for their
energy rise and profitability improve since the recommendations took
effect. The federal recommendations are applied "almost entirely" by
electricity companies in eight cantons, but are followed only partly in
nine cantons, and entirely ignored in the principal hydro-producing
cantons of Graubunden, Ticino and Valais.

Here the difference between the production cost of about Sfr0.04/kWh
($0.035/kWh) and the Sfr0.16/kWh recommended for autoproducers is just
too great. The authors of the report claim that a promotion of
decentralised energy production is a national objective, which does not
justify forcing the three "hydro cantons" to accept conditions which
would result in unfair local tariff increases.

The five remaining cantons (Geneva, Neuchatel, St Gallen, Schwyz and
Aargau) provided no information to the evaluators.

The report noted that participating cantons have asked for the creation
of a national fund to finance the extra cost of the scheme to
distribution companies. The report recommended increasing tariffs paid
to CHP operators by 20-50% (solar producers have long been campaigning
for such a rate increase). It noted that in cases where more than 30%
of the energy produced by a CHP unit was consumed on the premises, the
reward for supplying excess energy to the grid was not sufficient to
make CHP attractive to investors. This meant that while the trend to
multiplication of CHP in buildings and heating grids continued, it
received no extra boost from the tariff recommendations.

The report also pointed to disputes over whether or not the
recommendations should apply to an independent autoproducer's total
output or just amounts in excess of own needs. Finally, it recommended
renaming the recommendations as federal "directives" to make them seem
more consequential.

Responding to the report, Martin Renggli, who heads the Federal Energy
Office (FEO) policy service, told PiE that:

Efforts will continue to be made to use the tariffs to promote small
hydro plant, even though technically many are not "autoproducers". He
said there is unlikely to be any question of increasing the tariffs
paid to CHP operators producing from fossil fuel (gas), in view of
parliament's insistence that such measures target renewables, and not
fossil fuels.

He noted that the legislation clearly intends that the special tariff
applies only to excess production. Thus, to avoid unfair profiteering,
independent producers must use the energy themselves as far as
technically possible. A leaflet is currently being prepared to make
this absolutely clear.

Despite another of the report's recommendations, he said there will be
no change in the "5% rule" which requires the REC to pay when
autoproducer input exceeds 5% of a local distributor's total energy
supply.

On the financial points, he noted the Sfr0.16 average tariff paid to
autoproducers who use renewable energy sources is the equivalent of the
long-term marginal production cost. Meanwhile, as the idea of a tariff
fund was broadly opposed during an earlier consultation period for the
new Energy Law, it is unlikely to be considered now.

Switzerland is virtually the only country to apply such a tariff and
the biggest electric companies have not really embraced the
recommendation. According to the report, the amount they "reinject"
from autoproducers is a "minute" 0.2-1.3% of total energy turnover, or
just 0.5-0.7% of costs.

SWISS REGIONAL ELECTRIC COMPANIES TO FREEZE TARIFFS

Five major regional electric companies have agreed to freeze tariffs
for the next three years. The five companies are BKW, NOK, Atel, CKW
and EOS. Announcing the agreement, the ombudsman's office in Berne said
it was made possible by the RECs' "good, and in some cases very good,
1994 results".

Joseph Deiss, one of the members of the ombudsman's team, told PiE that
the announcement was not really the result of a general "agreement" but
rather of separate negotiations with each REC. It was the ombudsman who
had taken the initiative, on the assumption that the excellent 1994-95
results announced by these companies, and the very good hydro
conditions, should benefit the consumer.

Deiss pointed out that as there are over 1,200 electricity companies in
Switzerland, the office had chosen to deal only with the big players on
the assumption that the effect will trickle down. "Our objective is to
reverse the trend of the many recent tariff increase, in excess of the
rate of inflation and at a time when there is an abundance of energy on
the market. We are pleased with our success."

RESULTS FROM CKW GROUP

Switzerland's CKW Group had total energy turnover of Sfr480m ($417m),
an increase of Sfr33.6m improving the Group net profit by Sfr6.3m to
Sfr25m. This was obtained with the help of a 5% tariff increase in
October of 1994, a demand increase in the CKW distribution grid of
5.2%, and to a slight improvement in prices for energy sold on the
international spot market.

Carl Mugglin, chairman of the board of directors, told a January press
conference that CKW would not increase tariffs in 1996, thus giving
"voluntary support to the price ombudsman's efforts to stabilise
tariffs".

Mugglin repeated warnings about the danger of further increases in the
production cost of Swiss electricity, and particularly
hydroelectricity, due to various new taxes. CKW and other Swiss
electric companies have decided to abandon any major new hydro projects
in the near future, such as the Mauvoisin dam.

CKW's profit-and-loss account for 1994/95 amounted to Sfr551.4m.
Operating expenditure was Sfr428.1m. Total investments, in plant and
for drawing rights, were Sfr81.7m. The dividend will be unchanged at 8%
(Sfr40 per Sfr500 share).

Production increased 7.3% and energy from increased use of drawing
rights by 45%. The Leibstadt and Gosgen nuclear reactors supplied 7.6%
more power, due to greater efficiency. CKW's own nuclear production
amounted to 874 GWh, with another 466 GWh from drawing rights.

Nuclear generation accounted for two thirds of the energy supplied to
CKW's grid. The total cost of production increased almost Sfr23m to
Sfr270m. Total demand in the CKW Group distribution grids to 2,400 GWh,
up 4.8%. Total CKW Group energy turnover was 4,300 GWh, up 7.1%.

Demand in the CKW company's distribution grid increased 5.2%, thanks
mainly to a 13.7% increase in demand by three major accounts, and a
4.3% increase in demand by "general industry", indicating a strong
recovery in the Lucerne region's economy. The household/trade/
agriculture/services sector showed a demand increase of just 1.1%.

TURKEY NEEDS 183 POWER STATIONS TO MEET PROJECTED DEMAND

Turkey will have to build a total of 183 power stations over the next
15 years costing around $16bn to meet projected soaring demand,
according to a report compiled by the country's Energy & Natural
Resources Ministry. The report says generating capacity must increase
at around 8% over the period to 43,590 MW from 15,235 MW at end-1995 to
serve a rise in demand to 271,450 GWh from 94,605 GWh at present.

In particular, the report says that a power bottleneck could emerge in
1997, unless existing projects are completed on schedule, no existing
power plants are closed down for environmental reasons, and there is no
shortage in gas supply or upgraded lignite.

To prevent shortages, construction work should also start on planned
build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes as soon as possible, the report
adds. And state-owned Turkish Electricity Generation & Transmission
Corp (TEAS) should install a sufficient amount of shunt capacitors in
all power distribution systems operating at ratings of 34.5 kV or
below.

The demand forecast is based on rapid population growth, rising living
standards and industrial expansion. Per capital consumption is
projected to rise to 3,267 kWh in 2010 from 1,978 kWh, for example.

The power stations required break down into 106 hydro-electric
stations, 16 thermal plants and two nuclear stations. Further thermal
stations will also be required: 33 lignite or hard coal fired stations,
14 natural-gas fuelled plants and 12 stations fuelled by imported steam
coal.

The present nominal capacity is 20,857 MW, but due to ageing, effective
capacity is only 73% of this figure. The report therefore also says
rehabilitation and modernisation of existing plants will also be
essential.

Because of the high investment costs, foreign financing and capital
investment will be essential, according to the report. The government
will look to the private sector franchise, BOT method as one answer, as
well as the privatisation of existing units requiring updating and
expansion, the report adds.

Contracts so far signed on a BOT basis involve projects with a total
capacity of around 3,710 MW, including two gas-fired plants of around
500 MW each at Eregli on the Sea of Marmara, and a 180 MW plant at
Esenyurt in an Istanbul suburb. Also included is the 672 MW Birecik dam
scheme on the Euphrates river in the southeast, says the report.

Bids were also invited by the ministry for the BOT implementation of
the following plants: Beysehir-Konya (2 x 170 MW); Saray-Tekirdag (2 x
150 MW), Afsin Elbistan (4 x 340 MW), Tufanbeyli (2 x 150 MW, or 1 x
300 MW).

Generally, the report foresees:

* commissioning of the first natural gas-fired plant with a rating of
680 MW in 1996;

* start-up of the fifth and sixth units at the Afsin-Elbistan lignite
plant, each with a rating of 340 MW;

* start-up of the first hydro-electric plant in 2000;

* commissioning of the first nuclear plant with a rating of 1,000 MW in
2005;

* start-up of the first imported coal fired station with a rating of 2
x 500 MW as well in 2005.

* In a separate development, the ministry reckons there is a potential
in Turkey for 30% energy savings annually amounting to 13.2m toe
equivalent or $2.6bn, based on 1994 production and consumption figures.
Had electricity been generated and consumed in the most productive way,
savings would have amounted in the construction sectors and industry
generally to 5.3m toe, or around $1.2bn each; and in the transportation
sector, 2.8m toe, or $262m.

MISSION ENERGY ACQUIRES FIRST HYDRO

Mission Energy of the US has joined Eastern Group at the head of the
independent generator league after its #652.5m ($1.01bn) acquisition on
December 21 of First Hydro, the National Grid's former pumped storage
business.

First Hydro's two plants in North Wales have a combined capacity of
2,088 MW, adding to Mission's 80% holding in the 220 MW Roosecote CCGT
in the northwest and a 33% interest in Derwent Cogeneration Limited, a
214 MW plant in Derby. The final price was considerably in excess of
the #450m value put on the business in NGC's flotation prospectus.

The two stations give Mission a key role in ensuring the security of
supply in England and Wales, particularly in winter when Dinorwic and
Ffestiniog frequently set the pool price. Mission has indicated the
size of the bid - #325/kW - was made possible by its favourable tax
position; it will also have taken into account increasing price
differentials in recent price spikes (PiE 214/28). Its bid topped those
of two others, Scottish Hydro-Electric and Dominion Energy of the US.

Mission and Eastern Group, along with Enron and Applied Power Systems,
are bidding for National Power's (NP's) 4 GW of capacity (PiE 212/24).
James Iaco, Mission's senior vice-president, said the First Hydro deal
made the company keener to win the auction for the three NP coal-fired
stations.

The 12 regional electricity companies who owned First Hydro after it
had demerged from the Grid stated on December 28 that they would retain
the proceeds from the sale. They will, however, have to pay capital
gains tax on their profits.

LITTLECHILD PUBLISHES MODIFICATIONS TO LICENCES

Regulator Stephen Littlechild has published his proposed modifications
to the licences of South Western Electricity (SWEB) and Eastern Group
following their respective takeovers by Southern Electric International
and Hanson.

The modifications, already agreed by Southern and Hanson, deal with
financial ring-fencing of the electricity businesses, restrictions on
activities, availability of resources, disposal of assets and provision
of information to the regulator. The modifications will be applied to
other merged companies in due course.

Littlechild said: "the merged companies will continue to have to meet
their existing obligations under the Electricity Act and licences.
These additional licence modifications will allow me to continue to
regulate effectively and to ensure that customers continue to be fully
protected."

Meanwhile, Ian Lang, President of the Board of Trade, in early January
cleared the proposed #1.6bn southeastern distributor Seeboard by Dallas
utility Central & South West (CSW; PiE 212/25). The bid will not now be
referred to the Monopolies & Mergers Commission, as were the bids by
local generators National Power for Southern Electric and PowerGen for
Midlands (PiE 213/9).

CSW's offer went unconditional the day after the clearance. Unusually,
all executive directors of Seeboard will retain their positions, while
chairman Keith Stuart and six non-executive directors resigned. Jim
Ellis will combine the role of chairman with his current position of
chief executive.

The clearance of Welsh Water's #880m agreed bid for South Wales
Electricity (SWALEC; PiE 214/28), meanwhile, is not proving quite as
smooth. The Office of Fair Trading has delayed its ruling on the bid -
the second by a privatised UK water firm for a privatised UK
distributor - until January 25.

The bid prospects clouded further in early January as Welsh Water
rejected a proposal by the water regulator Ian Byatt that it maintain a
separate stock market listing for the companies following any takeover.
This proposal was believed to be the main condition in a clearance of
the deal by both water and electricity regulators, both of whom are
concerned to retain sufficient comparators to regulate their respective
industries.

However, Welsh Water, noting that North West Water (NWW) was not
required to maintain separate listing prior to clearance of its bid for
Norweb (PiE 211/25), claimed a separate listing would make efficient
management of the new group difficult. The company is continuing
discussions and says it will seek alternative ways to meet Byatt's
objectives.

* The merged NWW and Norweb were merged into a new holding company,
United Utilities, on January 1. The combined group will have a turnover
of over #2.5bn and is capitalised at over #3bn. The companies will
continue to trade under their former names.

NATIONAL POWER TO CUT 400 JOBS

National Power (NP) has announced it is to cut 400 jobs in a cost-
cutting exercise that is expected to save #100m ($155.3m) over two
years from its #1.4bn annual costs. The redundancies will come from
support divisions  in its Swindon headquarters, and equate to about a
third of its headquarters staff and almost 10% of its total 4,900.

Most of the cost savings, however, are expected to come from reviews of
business processes, with some #35m as a result of property
rationalisation.

NP said the review was sparked by the increasing competition in the
electricity market, and was the result partly of its enforced sale of
4,000 MW of coal plant, which is expected to be agreed by March (PiE
209/2).

NP has already cut its workforce by over two-thirds from the 16,000
staff it had at privatisation in 1991.

The move follows the company's mid-December buy back of a further 57m
shares, or 4.4% of its issued capital. The buyback, at a cost of #243m,
would increase gearing by 9 percentage points, said the company, but
would boost earnings per share by 2-3% in a full year.

* The company's finances may also be assisted by a surprising #300m
loan awarded in late December by the European Investment Bank for the
installation of flue gas desulphurisation equipment at its 3,750 MW
Drax coal-fired plant in Yorkshire.

NP, which applied for the loan several years ago, is due to complete
the so far self-financed #750m work on Drax this year.

VENEZUELAN FLOTATIONS EXPECTED BY SUMMER

The Venezuelan government has set out target dates for the
privatisation of its electricity sector, which it plans to start this
summer and extend through 1997.

Potential investors looking for a widely-spread flotation with the
potential for a large shareholding by the investing public will be
disappointed because the government's intention, at least at this
stage, is to place the bulk of power generation in the hands of a
single private sector investor or joint venture. Indications are that a
minority portion of shares will be more widely sold.

The initial piece of the sector to be placed on the market will be the
Margarita Island utility, which comprises a 146 MW power plant and a
100 MW submarine cable, as well as transmission and distribution
networks.

The regional utility has 90,000 subscribers, a high, 92% bill
collection ratio, and forecasts a demand rise of 8%-10% per year. The
utility, serving a resort area, is 15 miles off the coast.

The privatisation programme, disclosed by officials in Caracas, was
further explained in statements by Luis Xavier Grisanti, Director of
the Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela (FIV), the state holding company
that is overseeing the unbundling process. FIV has $10bn of assets,
half of which are in the power sector (Enelven-Enelco and Enelbar).

According to officials, the state plans to sell Enelbar (Energia
Electrica de Barquisimeto), Enelven (Energia Electrica de Venezuela)
and Enelco (Energia Electrica de la Costa Oriental), and to follow this
- at an as-yet undisclosed date - by the sale of the Planto Centro
thermal power generator. FIV owns 99% of the shares in these three
companies. Planto Central is more problematical, being the country's
largest power generator with 2,000 MW of capacity. Its preparation for
sale will take longer, said Grisanti.

One generation operation definitely not set for privatisation is the
massive Guri hydroelectric complex which is responsible for 10,000 MW
of electricity, more than half of all the country's capacity. The
government has said it will never privatise the hydropower complex;
most analysts concur that it would probably be impossible to do so.

According to Grisanti, the flotations are part of a large privatisation
programme involving tax reforms, establishment of a market-related
foreign exchange rate for the bolivar, a lifting or exchange controls,
price hikes for gasoline/petrol, the opening of the oil sector to
foreign investment (already under way), and an agreement with the World
Bank to supervise the privatisation of the power sector (PLA 5/19, Nov
1995).

In preparation for the flotation, the FIV has outlined a framework, or
action plan, which calls for the establishment of a rational tariff
schedule for 1996/97; a rationalisation of energy prices, such as oil,
gas and hydropower, improvement of utility management, and a market-
oriented regulatory framework for the sector. This last framework was
presented to the Electric Energy Regulatory Commission (CREE) last
autumn and to the utilities in December. The government says the
finalised framework should be ready by next month.

The regulatory framework calls for the following:

* Legal separation of generation, transmission and distribution.

* A single company to operate the national grid; free access to
transmission grid; and establishment of a single power pool.

* Freedom of entry to build generation capacity.

* Distribution companies and large industrial/commercial clients free
to sign direct P & S contracts.

* A new pricing mechanism for the wholesale market; and establishment
of short and long-term wholesale markets.

The action plan also calls for large end users to be able to buy freely
from generators and for distributors to buy wholesale at negotiated
tariffs.

Enelven generates, transmits and distributes thermal power. It has a
labour force of 1,702 and its 1,336 MW of capacity generates 3.6 TWh.
Enelco has a payroll of 480, installed capacity of 40 MW and an output
of 172.953 GWh.

Enelbar's labour force is 896, and its prime operation is to serve Lara
state. Its 150 MW of installed capacity, of which 120 MW is in use,
provides a gross generation of 1.6 TWh.

According to Grisanti, the plan is for a minimum sale of 79.9% of
shares in each of Enelven-Enelco  to a single investor group,
supplemented by an employee stock plan of up to 20%.

A minimum of 79.9% of Enelbar's shares also will be put on the market,
but these will be through an international tender, supplemented by an
employee stock ownership plan of up to 20%.

CHILE'S COLBUN:  PREPARING FOR PRIVATE LIFE

Colbun-Machicura, Chile's state-controlled hydroelectric generator, is
looking for a partner, or even partners, to provide finance and
expertise for a $400m development plan which will double its output in
the next three years.

If the search for a compatible associate is successful, Colbun will
eventually be a sizeable player in the industry, which is currently
dominated by two aggressive private sector companies, Endesa and
Chilgener.

Colbun is not selling off assets, as Jose Luis Mardones, its general
manager, explained in an interview with Power in Latin America.
Instead, the government is using the state company as a way to bring
new competitors into the field, specifically into the central
electricity grid (SIC).

Its model is the northern electricity network (SING), where there are
three private generators - Edelnor (controlled by Southern Company of
the US), Norgener (Chilgener) and Endesa. A controlling share in the
fourth, Tocopilla, owned by Codelco, the state copper corporation, was
awarded this month to a consortium of Powerfin, Iberdrola and Enagas
(see News). In this network prices have fallen steadily over recent
years.

The Colbun management began to develop its plan in the early days of
the Frei government in 1994, and gained approval for it the same year.
It is targeting three main areas, hydro power, gas generation and
transmission.

Hydro

In the hydroelectric sector, Colbun plans to increase capacity from 500
MW to around 730 MW by mid-1998. A first modest increase comes into
commission in May this year, with its 35 MW San Ignacio plant, down
river from the Colbun and Machicura plants. This, its third generating
centre, has cost $30m and was financed mainly with an equity issue
subscribed by existing private shareholders, bringing their share of
the company up from 7% to 15%.

Its fourth centre is the new 108 MW Rucue project, on a new river,
Laja, where it bought water rights from rival Endesa in 1994. Mardones
says preliminary studies are almost finished and a tender is expected
to go out before the end of January. The plant is scheduled to come
into operation in mid-1998 and represents an estimated investment of
$140m.

Gas plants

Colbun plans a move into gas-fired generation by 1998, with a plant at
Limache, in the Fifth Region, one of the most densely populated area
after Santiago. This is a turnkey project (PLA 4/24, Oct 1995), for
which General Electric, Mitsubishi and Siemens are reported to have
been short-listed. The plant will have a capacity of 340 MW-390 MW,
depending on the bid chosen. Colbun had originally budgeted $250m for
this project but now expects to be able to cut the cost by as much as
half.

Mardones said an important reason for locating the plant outside the
Santiago region was that it would not add to pollution in the capital,
which should be declared an ozone-saturated area in March this year. In
addition, being close to sea level gives greater efficiency, compared
to a Santiago site at 1,500ft. Also, the distance is not so significant
as to make transmission costs a major factor in supplying power to the
metropolitan region.

One other factor was also important. According to  Mardones the
government specifically wanted to see natural gas from Argentina taken
to the Fifth Region. Without Colbun's Limache plant, existing and
projected industrial and domestic consumption would not have justified
the $50m extension of the GasAndes pipeline from its route to Santiago.
The Fifth Region is industrially depressed, and the government hopes
the availability of natural gas will give it a comparative advantage
which will enable it to attract new industrial development. (Promoting
government decentralisation policy is not new to Colbun - it opened
offices in the southern provincial town of Talca on government
instructions.)

Transmission

The third plank of Colbun's strategy is a move into transmission, in a
direct challenge to Endesa, whose Transelec subsidiary has a monopoly
to carry power from the hydroelectric generating centres of the south
to the Santiago area.

The decision to build its own transmission line goes back to 1994 when
Transelec announced a hefty rise in its rates, and Colbun started
looking at the option of going independent. Its management decided that
the strategic advantage of having its own lines, and being able to
transmit up to 600 MW at peak time would be a valuable asset, as well
as making it independent of its competitor.

Endesa not surprisingly, has challenged Colbun's project (PLA 6/16, Dec
1995)  and has first option on the most convenient transmission route.
But negotiations are continuing, Mardones says, and Colbun is willing
to share the route and connect with Transelec to avoid duplication. In
that case, Colbun would be willing to upgrade its line to 500 kV and
bring forward its construction schedule to April 1997 to accommodate
Endesa's 447 MW Pangue plant, due on-line then.

But Mardones said a sine qua non was a satisfactory commercial
agreement giving his company freedom to use or sell the excess capacity
which will become available once a transformation bottleneck is
removed. This condition would only be fulfilled, according to Mardones,
if Transelec were to be made independent of Endesa.

In the meantime, Colbun intends to proceed with its plans. On January
3, it announced that it had awarded a contract to Asea Brown Boveri to
build the double-circuit 220 kV line, and given instructions to begin
work immediately. The value of the contract was not revealed, but
Mardones had previously estimated the cost as in the region of $50m.

Advice

Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, has been advising Colbun on
financing for its development plan, and the government is considering
its report. Kleinworts - which also advised on the Tocopilla sale -
recommended that Colbun's best option was to take one or more strategic
partners. In the case of multiple partners, Colbun would be divided
into three companies, covering hydroelectric and gas-fired generation
and transmission.

Among those mentioned as potential partners for Colbun are Southern
Company (operating in Chile as Southern Electric), CMS Energy, Entergy
and Luksic, a Chilean financial-industrial conglomerate (See News).

The latter recently sold a 6% stake in Enersis (PLA 6/16, Dec 1995),
the holding company which controls Endesa and the Chilectra
distribution company, in a move which was widely interpreted as a
declaration of interest in Colbun, though it is also said to have
wanted the cash. It is expected that, as in the case of the Tocopilla
sell-off, current players in the SIC will not be allowed to bid.

Mardones indicates considerable interest in a Colbun partnership,
claiming the company has already received many enquiries from potential
partners. The timing is still not clear, however, and Colbun has
government authorisation to borrow to bridge any financing gap that may
occur.

Colbun is looking for a partner which will not only bring finance,
Mardones insists, but which shares a philosophy and a set of strategic
goals for the future of electricity generation in Chile. Colbun wants
to promote competition in the sector, reduce prices, to protect the
environment and its workers.

In the meantime, Colbun has instituted a restructuring designed to
increase the company's asset values and make it attractive to
outsiders. Management changes have been implemented, and programmes to
cut costs, increase efficiency and strengthen the company's sales
portfolio have been put in place.

Mardones was brought in at the beginning of 1995 from Enami, the state
copper refining and marketing company. In July a new finance and
administration manager with a private banking background was recruited,
and in September, a new development division was set up. This division
has responsibility for the expansion plan.

Since July, Knox D'Arcy, a UK management consultant, has been working
with Colbun on a cost-cutting programme. This, recently completed, is
expected to bring savings of $1m a year, Mardones says, mostly as a
result of cutting out overtime payments. One of the objects of the
exercise was to increase productivity without staff reductions.
Employees have been redeployed to new projects.

A major change has already taken place in sales policy. Until 1990,
Colbun was allowed to sell energy only to the SIC, essentially
supplying other generators. Changes in the law, introduced in 1990,
opened the way for the state company to sell direct to its customers
and it has since built up a portfolio of clients which it considers one
of its major assets.

As of end-1994 it was supplying six distribution companies, including
Chilectra and Chilquinta, and a selection of industrial users,
including El Teniente, Codelco's major underground mine.

Colbun's direct sales activity was boosted further last year with a 29
MW a year contract to supply the Ventanas copper refinery, belonging to
Enami. And it is targeting further growth in direct supplies to
distributors and industrials, irrespective of - but useful to absorb -
its projected capacity increases. Mardones says that there will be news
on this front in the near future.

In 1994, Colbun made an after-tax profit of $55m, with operating
profits of $53m on sales of $124m. Profits in 1995 will show a drop to
around $40m. Although operating profits increased slightly, non-
operating profits were down as a result of lower monetary correction.

Beyond 1998, Colbun expects to continue investing around $100m per
year, developing a series of small hydroelectric plants, using water
rights which it bought in 1994 at the same time as those for the Rucue
plant. It will also eventually be considering a second gas-fired plant.

COMMERCIALISING POWER TARIFFS

One of the biggest obstacles to creating a truly commercial electricity
supply industry in Latin America is the continued subsidisation of
power tariffs and, in some cases, a political reluctance to wind down
such practices.

The phenomenon is not new, nor is it exclusive to Latin America, being
rampant in Asia and lurking, chameleon-like, within the power sectors
of Europe and North America.

As students of the power sector in the Third World know, no two
countries are exactly alike - populations, histories and political
systems are different. The same holds true of their electricity supply
industries (ESI), with some systems staggering under the weight of
subsidisation and others attacking the challenge of commercialisation
with vigour.

The theme forms an important part of a new study*, Electricity
Generation in Latin America, by David Kurtz, which examines, on a
country-by-country basis, the generation and supply systems of all
countries - save the Caribbean islands - south of the Rio Grande River.

Kurtz points out that electricity subsidisation grew out of the belief
that lower power prices could curb inflation and stimulate economic
growth, a belief, however honourable, which proved to be folly.

What happened instead in the 1972-88 period was that electricity prices
deteriorated in real terms by 22%, while operating costs rose by around
14%. Power was used inefficiently, bill collection deteriorated and the
financial burden on utilities and governments - most power sectors
being nationally owned - increased to the extent that funds to maintain
and upgrade power generating and delivery systems dried up.

By 1990, the Latin American Electricity Organisation (OLADE) was able
to report, unhappily, that only five of the trade association's 26-
members in Latin America and the Caribbean were charging prices at or
above the long-term marginal cost of power.

Even now in Brazil, which is preparing for a major restructuring of its
power sector, electricity prices are kept low for electoral purposes,
with low prices serving as a disincentive to private investors, which
are unable to gain the necessary returns. (It must be noted that the
noises coming out of Brazil for the past year indicate that the central
government is trying to devise formulas to `take this on' so as to
smooth the way for the partial unbundling of Eletrobras.)

According to Kurtz's study, Brazil's tariffs, through July 1994, are,
at best, very marginal, with domestic tariffs being set at 4.78o per
kilowatt hour; commercial at 5.65o and industrial at just 2.86o. (It is
to be noted that commercial rates in the Indian Subcontinent range
around 7o-plus per kilowatt hour on average. Anything much below 6.5o,
the formula used in Pakistan, is a tight squeeze for independent power
project sponsors.) The study indicates that the worst-case scenario is
seen in Venezuela, where domestic power tariffs average just 0.79o/kWh,
commercial 2.31o and industrial 1.61o/kWh.

There is an upside to this as well, notably in Chile, Argentina and
Peru which have embarked on major privatisation programmes which, in
the case of Chile and Argentina, are all but complete. Their collective
tariff levels are, if anything, slightly higher than those of the US,
where domestic tariffs averaged 8.82o/kWh through mid-1994, commercial
8.08o and industrial 5.02o.

The study takes note of some of the individual tariff variations. In
Argentina and Colombia (See Table) domestic rates are much lower than
commercial rates and lower also than industrial rates. "This pricing
method, which is aimed at gaining favour from the voting public,
disadvantages industry", says Kurtz. "However, with the exception of
Argentina, where many industries are in the public sector, what the
government loses in higher industrial electricity costs it gains from
higher electricity revenues.

"By charging the commercial and industrial sectors higher prices, the
government is, therefore, better able to subsidise the residential
sector's prices, in return for electoral gains."

New players

The report is encouraged, nevertheless, by the momentum behind
electricity reform - there is scarcely a country mentioned in the
report that has not undertaken reforms or that is at least actively
planning them. This will mean an enhanced role for foreign concerns
either through sponsorship of new projects within the region or through
 acquisition of existing assets.

The report breaks down the likely big players - many of them already
stakeholders in various countries even now - into three categories.
Among regional companies are such active Chilean majors as Chilgener
and Endesa; from North America, there are Enron, Duke Power, Dominion
Energy, CMS Generation and Liberty Power/Cogentrix (See Bolivia News).

From abroad, meanwhile, the report notes the activities of Broken Hill
Proprietary of Australia, Spain's Endesa and Iberdrola, and the French
state utility Electricite de France. Not mentioned but certainly very
much a player is British Gas which, since the date of the report's
publication, has decided to shift its all-Americas operational
headquarters out of Texas to Argentina.

In spite of the economic difficulties that have beset Latin America -
some of them almost unique by  global standards, such as hyperinflation
- the region's share of electricity supply is, on a per capita basis,
better than that of Asia, the world's fastest-growing economic region.
The Indian subcontinent, with more than 1bn people, has 3% of total
global installed capacity of 2,911 GW, whereas Latin America, with less
than half that population level, has 6%.

China, bigger again, has 7%, with the rest of Asia and Australasia
taking a 13% share. Europe's share is 35% and North America's 28%
(albeit North America's installed capacity per head is nearly twice
that of Europe). Bringing up the rear are Russia/Middle East at 5% and
Africa at 3%.

What will Latin America's share be by 2003? Kurtz claims, using figures
from General Electric of the US, that total new generating capacity
worldwide by then will be 1,089 GW.  Latin America's share will have
climbed to 8%, while other Third World growth areas, such as
Asia/Australia, the Indian subcontinent and China will have increased
their shares to 22%, 6% and 16% respectively.

It is acknowledged that the European and North American electricity
supply industries are "mature", to say the least. Therefore their
global share of new capacity will have diminished to 18% and 17%
respectively. (It is for that reason that European and American
companies are taking such a high profile role in investing in the
electricity industries of developing countries.)

Another area of significant development is the progress made in recent
decades on the rate of electrification. According to OLADE, this
increased from 40% in 1970 to 70% in 1989. The report does caution,
however, that some of this growth increase stems more from urbanisation
of national populations rather than rural electrification. The report
does not ignore the `convenience' factor in spurring growth - the
growth in the sale of refrigerators, of cookers/stoves and even of
microwave ovens.

The most electrified countries so far are Uruguay, Argentina and Chile,
all at around 92% as a percentage share of population with electricity.
Those with the lost level of achievement are Paraguay, at 60%, Bolivia
at about 53 % and Peru at 48%.

CHILE CONTINUES ARGENTINE WOOING

The love affair between Chilean energy groups and their Argentine
counterparts continued in January, when companies from Chile made
further incursions into the electricity market of their trans-Andean
neighbour. New deals followed the important acquisition last December
of 39% of Buenos Aires utility Edesur by Chile's Enersis for $390m.

Chilean companies, looking for opportunities beyond their own
relatively small - though fast growing - domestic market of 14m people,
have increasingly turned their attention to neighbouring Argentina with
its far larger market of 33m consumers. In the past four years, they
have spent well in excess of $3bn on acquiring large chunks of
Argentine distributors and generators, mainly through the privatisation
process that broke up the old state-owned SEGBA. Along with a few other
countries such as the US and Spain, Chile is now one of the most
important players in the Argentine energy market.

For years Chile and Argentina, very different countries despite their
3,000-mile long shared border, were arch rivals. They nearly went to
war in the early 1980s, when both countries were ruled by military
dictatorships, over a dispute about the Beagle channel. In those dark
days, when Argentina was still pursuing a protectionist development
model, the idea of big cross-border investments was unthinkable.

But stability, democracy and rapprochement between former president
Patricio Aylwin of Chile and President Carlos Menem of Argentina paved
the way for much closer economic ties. Chile's participation in
Argentina's electricity privatisation process, an already functioning
oil pipeline and two planned gas pipelines between the two countries
are evidence that old suspicions are being consigned to history.

Indeed, Chilean groups, facing the possibility of a future energy glut
at home, show no sign of losing interest in Argentina, richer than
Chile, though less stable. With most opportunities in Argentina's
national network having been already bought up, Chilean companies are
now turning their attention to the country's provincial power sector.

Early in January, a consortium led by Emec, a subsidiary of Chile's
Sidgo Koppers group, beat off bids from three other hopefuls, paying
$63m in the privatisation of 90% of Empresa Electrica de San Juan. The
regional utility, which supplies an estimated 130,000 consumers in the
western Andean province, turns over around $60m a year. Emec will hope
to raise revenue well above this level by emulating other Chilean
companies which have a strong track-record of clamping down on the
illegal electricity connections, until recently endemic in Argentina.

The Agua Negra consortium, in which Emec has a 66% stake with the
remaining 34% held by Chilgener unit Hidroandes, may have been prompted
to invest in San Juan by the province's significant potential as a
mining region. Argentina's nascent mining industry, concentrated in the
Andean provinces, will need a reliable energy supply should the big
projects that are being predicted come on-line.

Chilean companies are likely to see further opportunities to purchase
provincial energy companies in Argentina. The federal government in
Buenos Aires is making financial aid to its 23, mostly cash-strapped,
provinces subject to a provincial government's willingness to transfer
state assets to the private sector.

Top on the list with banks are provincial generators and distributors,
many of which lose money and tend to be grossly overstaffed. The
Chileans, with hard-won experience of downsizing Argentine energy
companies, may feel they are up to the job of turning round these loss-
making provincial entities.

Among local governments that have already announced plans to privatise
their energy companies are Mendoza, the prosperous Andean province,
Santa Fe, one of Argentina's main industrial centres, Jujuy in the
north-west and Rio Negro in Patagonia. Chilean groups may to be
interested in all these sell-offs.

On the national scene, the Argentine investment arm of Chile's Endesa
has been active, buying an additional 17% stake in Buenos Aires-based
generator Central Constanera, which, following several expansions, now
has a nominal installed capacity of 1,260 MW, the largest in Argentina.
The purchase brings to 45% Endesa's stake in Central Constanera. Only a
few days before, Endesa had bought a 9% stake in generator Central
Termoelectrica Buenos Aires, itself 51%-owned by Central Costanera.

These purchases follow a flurry of activity towards the end of 1995,
which represented something of a second-wave in the assault on
Argentina by Chile's cash-rich utilities (PLA 6/12, Dec 1995).

This saw Enersis paying $390m for 39% of Edesur and then swapping
shares with fellow-Chilean Endesa to raise its Edesur stake still
further. Enersis is now to concentrate on generation, while Endesa will
stick more to distribution. Chilectra, in which Enersis is the biggest
shareholder, and Chilgener, a Chilean generator, also have important
slices of Argentine utilities. Chilean groups also have stakes in
Argentina's provincial hydroelectric plants, such as El Chocon.

According to Charles Barnett, energy analyst at Smith Barney, Chilean
involvement is a positive development for the Argentine energy sector.
Chilean electric utilities are " undoubtedly the most efficient and
best-managed in the region", he says. Most have now overcome the
initial resentment of Argentine consumers, many of whom baulked at
paying their electricity bills to a company from Chile.

Barnett says the fact that, for example, the future of Central
Costanera is in the hands of "top-notch" management from Endesa should
help to ensure this Argentine generator a bright future. The company's
shares are valued at half those of a typical Chilean energy utility,
but over time, says Barnett, their value is likely to catch up with
those of its Chilean rivals.

Chilean groups have had such success in Argentina that some are now
seeking to repeat the performance in Peru. When Brazil liberalises its
energy sector, there is little doubt that Chilean companies will be
there too.

HAITI REFORMS AWAIT NEW LEADER

An improvement in Haiti's deteriorating power supply will have to await
the installation in February of Rene Preval, who will succeed President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Preval will then indicate whether he will start
the implementation of politically unpopular reforms, including the
divestment of several state enterprises, including the power company.

The state of the company's generation and transmission facilities,
however, will deter "even the most optimistic of potential buyers"
according to a confidential report prepared by a US consulting firm.
"The amount of money which will be needed to make the company viable
will be an obstacle, if not to privatisation, at least to the plans for
a significant expansion in generating capacity", the report said.

The modernisation of the power company will cost about $970m, said Erns
Exceus, head of the government's privatisation programme. The company,
which uses oil-fired generators, has nominal capacity of 217 MW, but is
generating 101 MW, he said.

According to the country's economic development plan, Haiti will need
1,250 MW by 2004, reported Exceus. Current demand is 390 MW, said
government officials, and the shortfall from the power company is being
met by small private generators.

"These are expensive problems, but they also represent opportunities
for investors", Exceus said. The government hopes to set up rural
electrification projects using hydro-electric power, he added. The cost
estimates are "frightening", said Richard Archi, an economist with the
Inter-American Development Bank, which is Haiti's biggest international
creditor.

In addition to financing the expansion of company to meet the planned
demand, the investors will have to deal with the politically sensitive
issue of a significant increase in tariffs.

Haiti, with a population of 7m, is the poorest country in the Americas,
and the report suggests that there is an inadequate client base to
financially support the magnitude of expansion which the government
hopes will happen.

Commercial consumption has also been reduced in recent years as
companies closed after an embargo was put on the country to force out
of office the military which had overthrown and exiled Aristide for
three years. "The prospects for a rapid and significant improvement in
Haiti's power supply are not bright", the report said.

$4BN BID FOR YACYRETA?

A consortium formed by Ontario Hydro of Canada and the US company AES
Americas is reported to have offered $4bn to take over Yacyreta, the
monstrously expensive 3,000 MW hydroelectric plant that the Argentine
economy ministry is keen to shuffle off to the private sector.

Argentine newspapers reported that the consortium had offered $4bn,
more than double the $1.8bn set as a target by the government, after
discussions with Argentina's Energy Secretary, Carlos Bastos. Bastos
denied any such offer had been made, although he admitted talks had
taken place.

A western diplomat close to the negotiations confirmed that
representatives of the consortium had been in Buenos Aires on several
occasions with a view to putting together an offer. He did not know if
a concrete bid had been made.

"Everything is still very much in the air", the diplomat said. The
Argentine government, which owns the still uncompleted dam jointly with
Paraguay, had not obtained the go-ahead to privatise Yacyreta either
from the Paraguayan government or from its own Congress, he said.

"It's not clear whether the Argentine Congress will be amenable to the
deal." Neither had the basis for the sale been properly laid out, which
could explain the huge discrepancy between the supposed offer and the
government's figure. "It`s like trying to shoot at a moving target. The
government is still trying to put a package together and explain
exactly what is on offer."

The proposal from the consortium is said to involve payment of a fixed
sum in return for ownership of, rather than an operating concession for
the dam. The government's idea had been to offer a 20-30 year
concession on Yacyreta. The consortium would then assume all the risks
involved in completing the project, a process that would involve adding
15 turbines to the bring the dam to its full complement of 20, as well
as raising the level of the dam from 76 to 83 metres.

The latter process could involve the potentially controversial and
costly displacement of thousands of people. Indeed, it has taken so
long to complete the project that several hundred poor Paraguayan
families are said to have moved close to the dam so that they can sue
for compensation should they need to be relocated.

Bastos, reacting to the reports, said that if the $4bn referred to was
supposed to represent the whole value of Yacyreta, it vastly
underestimated the dam's worth. Yacyreta, dubbed by President Carlos
Menem of Argentina "a monument to corruption", cost an estimated $8bn
to build.

* Central Costanera has reported a rise in revenues and profits for
1995. Net profits reached $40.9m in 1995 compared to $36.7m in 1994, on
revenues up to $302.2m from $271.9m in 1994.

PEREZ BUILDS BA THERMAL PLANT

Perez Companc, the huge energy-based conglomerate, is to spend $230m on
building a 660 MW gas-fired power station in Ezeiza, a Buenos Aires
suburb. The power station, to be called Genelba, will be the second
biggest in the country after Central Costanera. Perez, which has
important stakes in electricity generation, transmission and
distribution, will feed energy from the plant into its own network.

Perez controls 16.6% of Edesur, through its 32.5% stake in the
Distrilec holding company, 5.99% of Central Costanera, the Buenos Aires
generator, and 9.75% of Transener, which owns and operates the 500 kV
and part of the 220 kV Argentine interconnected system.

Work started in mid-January and the plant is expected to be in
production by 1997. Given current market prices, Genelba should produce
energy worth an annual $130m.

Meanwhile, a second new Buenos Aires plant is also on the cards.
Generator Central Puerto has announced that it is planning to install a
360 MW combined cycle plant in the Argentine capital. The plant,
estimated to cost $140m, should be completed by 1998 and is expected to
produce energy at a 30% discount on conventional thermal power.

Central Puerto is keen to reduce production costs given the sharp rise
in power supply and falling prices. According to ING Barings, the
company is already the most leveraged electric utility in Latin
America, with a net debt/equity ratio of 88.7%

Separately, Central Puerto has merged formally with its 60%-owned
subsidiary Central Neuquen, which supplies electricity to parts of
Patagonia in southern Argentina. The purpose of the merger is to allow
Central Puerto to take advantage of tax credits held by Central Neuquen
worth about $25m.

A LITTLE LIGHT TROUBLE

The privatisation of Light, already delayed from December to March 13
(PLA 6/1, Dec 1995), has run into more trouble.

A few days before the scheduled December 28 publication of Light's
privatisation prospectus, the electricity workers' union, which holds
shares in the company, lodged a legal objection to the proposal to
split the company into two - the viable Light Rio, and Light
Participacoes, which would retain the company's 47% stake in the
country's largest distributor Eletropaulo and the R$1bn or so of the
latter's debts to Light.

Light has around half the capital of Eletropaulo whose total value is
put at R$3.5bn (US$3.6bn)  - interestingly close to the new, higher
estimates of Light's value, R$3.7bn, despite its R$1bn of Eletropaulo
debt. According to the Brazilian press, Eletropaulo - whose cost-
cutting includes laying off 5,000 staff in 1995 - is expected to be
operating efficiently in three year's time when Light's stake is
expected to be worth around R$4.5bn.

Although the objection was subsequently overturned in the courts, it
led to the postponement of a shareholders' meeting to OK the split,
which in turn is considered likely to delay the auction date by a
further two weeks to the end of March.

Brazilian observers of the process say, however, that even the end
March deadline is too optimistic and is likely to be met only if Light
desists from the split, which is now due to be approved by shareholders
at the end of January and sells the company along with its debts.
Otherwise, they say, the auction is likely to take place at the
earliest in May.

This will include an element of shares for sale to consumers via a fund
set up in the middle of January by Banco do Brasil. The minimum
investment in the new fund, BB Investment Privatization Fund-Light, has
been set at R$200. Deposits will be held in a fixed interest account
until the Light auction date, when they will be used to purchase
shares. Banco do Brasil estimates that the fund would attract R$50m-
100m. It intends to establish similar funds for subsequent
privatisations.

Meanwhile, once Light is out of the way, Eletrobras intends to move on
to other sales. It is currently studying a strategy for further
privatisations that would begin with Furnas, the south eastern
generator, which has been asked to prepare alternative scenarios for
its future.

These include the sale of one hydroelectric dam; the sale of several
dams on the same river basin or the division of Furnas into several
parts. Furnas is to present its recommendations by the end of January.
Eletrobras controls three other regional generators - Eletrosul,
Eletronorte and CHESF - but Furnas is the most important in terms of
population, industry and consumption. The company currently generates
54 GW and plans to double its capacity in the next 12 to 15 years.

* Emmanuel Nobrega Sobral was appointed president of Eletropaulo at the
end of December. Sobral, formerly Eletropaulo's financial director,
replaces Paulo Feldmann.

ENERGETICA SALE SET FOR APRIL

The auction of Nacional Energetica has been set for April. Originally,
it was thought that the company - with assets of R$185m (US$190.2m) -
would be sold in January, following the November liquidation of its
parent, Banco Nacional, which went into liquidation and was absorbed in
December by Unibanco.

Nacional Energetica, left on the shelf by Unibanco, is currently under
Central Bank control. Its main asset in the energy sector is a 51.54%
stake in the 1,300 MW Serra da Mesa dam on the River Tocantins in Goias
state. The project, under construction in partnership with regional
generation company Furnas Centrais Eletricas, is scheduled for
completion by April 1998, and is expected to generate earnings of $100m-
$400m a year.

Work on the dam continues apace despite the uncertainty over Nacional
Energetica's ownership thanks to Brazil's National Development Bank,
BNDES, which is providing project finance to the tune of R$57m. This
amount is sufficient for construction work to continue until the end of
March. Camargo Correa is carrying out civil engineering on the dam
which is now 70% complete. Nacional Energetica had invested R$247m in
the dam up to the start of this year, and and BNDES - which has pledged
to provide the remaining finance for the project - R$153m.

Nacional Energetica's president, Victor Paranhos, said in late January
that he had already been approached by 28 parties interested in the
company, including nine power companies (seven from the US) the Iven
Consortium which controls Escelsa, and Camargo Correa, Brazil's largest
construction company.

CEEE, CERJ PRIVATISATION PROGRESS

The state energy company of Rio Grande do Sul state, Companhia Estadual
de Energia Eletrica - CEEE, was authorised to open its capital to the
private sector by the state legislature in late December following the
presentation of a bill to this effect in November (PLA 6/2, Dec 1995).

A maximum of 49% of the shares in CEEE - estimated to be worth between
R$2.8bn (US$2.9bn) and R$5bn - will be sold under the proposal. The
company, which has debts of $90m, 9,800 active staff and 2,600
pensioners, is currently 99.8%-owned by Rio Grande do Sul state.

The next step is the evaluation of the company's assets and the drawing
up of a model of energy production and distribution in the state. Three
consortiums and an individual company submitted bids for this task on
December 28: Fator, Nera, Mercados and Arthur Andersen; Andersen
Consulting, Kleinwort Benson, Termoconsult and MMSO; Projeta, Deloitte
and Engevix; and consultant Booz, Allen & Hamilton do Brasil
Consultores.

Prequalifying technical proposals drawn up by the competitors will be
submitted for judgement in mid-January, while their prices for CEEE
will be presented in early February. The winners of the process will be
announced at the beginning of April.

The state government wants the consultants to give a clear definition
of all the steps necessary to place CEEE shares with their true value
on the market. It expects to have this information plus  details of an
energy plan for the state ready by the end of June 1996.

According to state energy secretary, Assis Alberto de Souza, CEEE
should invest R$150m in 1996 with $100m being financed by an issue of
debentures. In 1995 CEEE invested just $37m.

Rio Grande do Sul is the only Brazilian state where coal-fired power
stations predominate using local low grade, high ash deposits. Foreign
companies have shown an interest in making the plants more
environmentally-friendly in recent years. Neighbouring Uruguay has
complained of acid-rain caused by the plants.

The state government will be pressing for coal-fired solutions given
the jobs they sustain in the local mining industry.

Other regional privatisations are also progressing. Rio de Janeiro
state's Companhia de Energia Eletrica de Rio de Janeiro (CERJ) is
currently speeding towards the private sector.

At the end of December the state established a commission to manage the
process of selling off 14 of the state's 26 companies, and has just
published a prospectus for consultants to evaluate CERJ's assets and
prepare it for privatisation. CERJ distributes 25% of the state's
power, serving 1.2m customers; employs 4,806 staff (down from 5,758 a
year earlier) and had debts of R$54m in 1994.

The deadline for bids for the contract to advise on the CERJ
privatisation model isMarch 11, with the state announcing the winner a
month later. The privatisation reports are scheduled to be presented by
the end of August, allowing for privatisation in September. The
National Development Bank (BNDES) has agreed to lend the state R$244m
on the back of anticipated privatisation receipts.

Meanwhile, Mato Grosso state has also recently joined the bandwagon,
with an announcement that the state government was launching a series
of administrative reforms that would make possible the privatisation of
Cemat, as well as the regional bank, Bemat.

These will include regulations for offering concessions for public
services to the private sector and the removal of state subsidies. A
bill authorising the privatisations is expected to be sent to the
legislature by June this year.

* Sao Paulo state's secretary for energy, David Zylbersztajn, has sent
a bill to the state legislative proposing the creation of a public
energy service commission which will have the mission of regulating and
controlling electric energy services in the state.

CPFL UPS SALES, CUTS COSTS

Sao Paulo state electricity company, CPFL (Companhia Paulista de Forca
e Luz), has registered increased power consumption of 6% in 1995, with
an increase of 90,000 in its customer baseto 2.2m, mainly located
outside of Sao Paulo city.

Whether this will be sufficient to help stave off the worst of its
immediate financial problems, however, remains to be seen. In the first
nine months of last year, the company produced a five-fold increase in
net losses, and analysts at Brazil's Garantia bank are forecasting full
year losses of R$84m (US$86.4m) compared to a profit of R$22m in 1994,
as a result of higher operating costs and lower tariffs in real terms
following the July 1994 price freeze.

According to company president, Cesare Manfredi, CPFL is tackling its
costs, and anticipates savings of R$27m in 1996. In 1995, it
restructured its administration and reduced staff from 7,700 to 6,900.

The company has also worked on a restructuring of its business
divisions. In line with the unbundling proposals of state energy
secretary David Zylberstajn, it has now separated the accounting of its
generation, transmission and distribution sectors. CPFL has also
divided its operations into three business units: South East, North
East and North West.

CPFL plans to continue to invest next year, despite the cutbacks,
planning expenditure of R$90m, with R$30m of this used to maintain and
expand its system. During 1996 CPFL intends to build new sub-stations
at Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Lencois Paulista, Campinas, Sumari, Itapira
and Americana.

Amongst Brazil's electricity supply concessionaries, CPFL boasts the
shortest and the least frequent electricity supply interruptions.
CPFL's maximum period of interruption was 8.7 hours while the Brazilian
average was 16.5 hours. CPFL had an average interruption frequency of
6.7 per client compared to 21.5 nationwide.

There are three electricity concessionaries operating in Sao Paulo
state, CESP (Companhia Estadual de Sao Paulo); CPFL and Eletropaulo.
Sao Paulo, covering an area the size of the UK, is Brazil's most
populous state with over 33m inhabitants and is responsible for around
45% of the country's GDP.

ENERGY DEMAND RISES 7.6%

Brazil used 7.6% more energy in the eleven months to November 1995 than
in the same period in 1994, according to the latest statistics released
by Eletrobras. The figures for the full year should show a rise of 7.8%
says Eletrobras, well above the annual average of 3.3% registered in
1990-1994.

Electricity consumption clearly outstripped Brazil's GDP growth of
around 4% and points to energy shortages in the short-term if
investments are not stepped up in the sector.

A significant part of Brazil's increased energy consumption comes from
residential users. Since the introduction of the country's successful
anti-inflation plan in July 1994 there has been a marked increase in
the purchasing power of low income families who have acquired more
electric domestic appliances.

In 1994 these sales rocketed by 35% over 1993. In 1995 these rose a
further 15% with 40m units sold. As a result of using these appliances,
a large number of electricity consumers have moved into the category of
users of over 200 kW/month.

HYDRO OUTPUT BREAKS RECORDS

The world's largest dam, Itaipu, jointly-owned by Brazil and Paraguay
broke its own record in 1995 by producing 77.21 TWh. This was 11.2% up
on the level achieved in 1994. The increase was due to reduced
generator stoppages through improved maintenance programmes. The 18
turbines operated at 93% capacity during 1995. The 77.21 TWh
represented 31% of all Brazil's energy production in 1995.

Despite the progress, Itaipu is still owed large sums - R$1.4bn
(US$1.44bn) - by Brazilian energy distributors. The state government of
Sao Paulo (CESP, CPFL and Eletropaulo) is the largest debtor, owing
$1.2bn for energy used. The remaining $200m is owed by Eletrosul,
Furnas and ANDE.

Meanwhile, output is also breaking records at Companhia Estadual de Sao
Paulo (CESP), which beat its 1993 annual generation high at 10 a.m. on
December 22 last year, with output of 52 TWh. CESP is Brazil's largest
generating company, responsible for 22% of the country's energy
production. It is able to cover the equivalent of all consumption by
Brazil's 38m households. The company expects its revenue from
distribution to increase by R$9m in 1995.

NEW CHAIRMAN FOR BOLPOW

Bolivian Power Co, the only private sector power generator in Bolivia,
has announced the appointment of E. Glen Biggs to succeed Frank Benner
as board chairman. Benner will remain a director of the company, which
has the rare distinction for a Latin America power generator of being
quoted on the New York stock exchange.

The company also announced that Bruce McMillen, senior group vice-
president and chief financial officer of Cogentrix Energy of the US,
had resigned from Bolivian Power's board. He is succeeded by David
Lewis, presently chief executive at Cogentrix Energy.

Bolivian Power, founded in 1925, distributes and transmits power in La
Paz and Oruro. It has a 34% share of all generation in the country,
operates 13 hydo facilities with a total capacity of 134 MW and is
expanding by 62 MW its hydro capacity in the so-called Zongo Valley
project.

Part of this capacity will be on-line this year and all will be
delivering power by 1998. It is also installing a gas-fired plant of 17
MW at El Alto near La Paz, which went on-line last summer. It is
considering a 230 MW hydropower operation in the Miguillas Valley. Its
growth rate this decade has been in excess of 6%.

Bolivian Power's shareholding includes a 17% stake held by Liberty
Power/Cogentrix Bolivia Inc. According to the New Electricity Law, it
will divest itself of power distribution responsibility, and will focus
on generation. Its net income last year was $7.7m on a turnover of
$45.9m.

TOCOPILLA FLOATED

Codelco, the state copper corporation, has chosen a consortium of
Belgium's Powerfin, Spain's Iberdrola and the domestic Enagas as its
strategic partner for the Tocopilla power plant.

The decision was made eventually a month later than the scheduled late
December date as a result of a lengthier and more complex due diligence
process than Codelco had anticipated

The agreement calls for the formation of a new equity partnership in
Tocapilla Holding Ltda., which controls the 615 MW, coal-fired
Tocopilla power plant near Antofagasta in northern Chile.

Powerfin has a 62.5% stake in the bidding consortium, with Iberdrola
holding 25% and Enagas having the balance. The consortium will pay
$177. 8m for a 51% stake in Tocopilla, with Codelco controlling the
remainder. Codelco is to set up a new company to own the 51% stake,
which will in turn be 51% owned by the bidders.

The remaining 49% of Tocopilla will also eventually be sold, 10% to the
plant's workers and the remainder through local exchanges or ADRs.

Powerfin's parent Belgian utility Tractebel said that some $70m needed
to purchase Tocopilla will be funded through project financing. The
balance of $110m will come from the three bidding companies.

Tocopilla consists of ten units, a port and 600 km of high-voltag e
transmission lines. It has a workforce of 400 and will be operated
jointly by Iberdrola and Powerfin under the latter's lead. The site's
electricity is sold mainly via long-term contracts to northern Chile's
copper mines, including that of Chuquicamata, the world's largest open-
pit copper mine, and will supply Codelco's El Abra joint venture with
Cyprus Amax Minerals (130,000m tpy), when it starts producing in late
1996.

Meanwhile, the plant has recently picked up yet another mine contract,
signing a 20-year deal to supply Codelco's Radomiro Tomic mine, which
will have output of 130m tpy from 1997. The Radomiro Tomic contract is
estimated to be worth $55m and is for 70 MW from 1998 to 2002, rising
afterwards to100 MW. It will use part of the same transmission system
as the El Abra mine. A contract for the latter has been awarded to the
Spanish-Chilean firm Abenor S.A.

CONSUMPTION SOARS 9.2%, ANOTHER 8.8% SEEN IN `96

Chile's electricity consumption soared by 9.2% last year compared to
1994, reports the National Energy Commission (CNE). The figures showed
demand for liquid fuels climbed 7.4%, while coal consumption was 14%
higher.

"The sector has been able to supply in an opportune way the growing
energy requirements which are the result of the country's strong
economic and social development", CNE president Alejandro Jadresic
said.

The forecast is for a further increase of 8.8% this year. The energy
sector is one of Chile's most active, with projects worth more than
$4bn under construction or in advanced planning. These include thermal
and hydropower stations, two natural gas pipelines and expansion
projects at oil refineries.

According to the CNE, the two trans-Andean pipeline schemes continue to
advance. CNE`s records show that the GasAndes scheme, led by Chilgener
and Canada's Nova Corp. had already presented its environmental impact
study for approval and has negotiated 85% of the rights of way needed
for the pipeline scheme. TransGas, headed by Tennedo of the US and
British Gas had not yet presented its environmental impact study. It
had agreed 65% of its rights of way, said Jadresic.

Both plan to supply Chile with natural gas from central Argentina but
by different routes, Gasandes linking the Neuquen gasfields in northern
Argentina to Santiago, the Chilean capital, and TransGas traversing the
Andes by a more southerly route.

GasAndes says it will start laying pipe on the Argentine side of the
border in January. In Chile, they are waiting for approval of their
environmental impact study but say they are still on schedule. They are
meeting steady opposition from neighbourhood groups on the route down
to Santiago through a local beauty spot, the Cajon del Maipo.

LUKSIC, US GROUPS TIE UP ATACAMA PIPE SCHEME

CMS Energy and the Williams International Pipeline Co. of the US plan
to go ahead with the Atacama gas pipeline project and have signed
letters of intent with the local Luksic group. Luksic would take a 15%-
20% stake in the $350m project while CMS and Williams keep 40%. The
project is still looking for an Argentine partner.

The pipeline would bring gas from Jujuy in northern Argentina, near the
Argentinan-Bolivian border with northern Chile, to Tocopilla on Chile's
north coast, with branches further north to Iquique and south to
Antofagasta. The new timing is for an open season in the first half of
this year with work starting before the end of the year and the pipe
coming into operation in early 1998.

CMS and Williams say they need to sign contracts with power generators
for between 600 MW and 800 MW of capacity for the project to be viable.
The initial capacity of the pipeline would be 3.4 MMcm per day. Some
doubt has, however, been expressed as to the immediate viability of the
project.

The new Collahuasi copper mine has signed a contract with Endesa (PLA
3/13, Sept 1995) for power which will be generated by its new coal-
fired Patache plant. In the view of the government's National Energy
Commission (CNE), this alone is sufficient to postpone the supply of
gas to the area for the short and medium-term.

It is not clear that the generating companies of the northern
electricity network will want to convert from coal to gas. But a
spokesman for Williams says they are confident about getting the
contracts they need.

The project, if it goes ahead, could bring to three the number of gas
pipelines running from Argentina. The northern link would complement
the more complex Gas Sur and Gas Andes pipelines schemes being prepared
to deliver gas from Central Argentina to the Santiago/ Concepcion areas
on Chile's central west coast.

Endesa has been awarded a two-year provisional licence by the state
auditing board for the controversial 570 MW Ralco dam project on the
Bio Bio river.

The authorisation was given in the face of strong opposition from
environmentalists and locals, who were concerned about the visual
impact on the site, a beauty spot, and the enforced relocation of the
Pehuenche Indians who live nearby.

The licence will allow the state generator to begin detailed studies
into construction prospects for the $600m dam and to examine its impact
on the environment. Endesa wants the hydro plant to be on-line by 2002.

CHILGENER PLANS $500M INVESTMENTS FOR `96

Chilgener's G-M Jose Antonio Guzman announced investments of $500m for
1996. These could rise to $650m depending on the success of the
company's bids in privatisation sales in other Latin American
countries.

Financing will come mostly from bond issues. For example Chilgener this
month issued a `yankee bond,' placing $150m on the US market in the
form of 10-year bonds. The bond issue was placed by Smith Barney, Chase
Securities and ING Barings. A separate private place of $180m will help
refinance its Gualcolda power plant.

The Empresa Electrica de Santiago, which is building the Nueva Renca
gas-fired power plant and in which Chilgener has a 51% stake, will not,
according to Guzman, need new financing. The plant will be built using
suppliers credits.

* Moody's Investors Service has assigned a Baa-1 rating to the $150m
bond. The rating reflects Chilgener's solid financial position and
sound business strategy, says Moody's, emphasising that the company is
also operating in a stable regulatory and economic regime.

About two thirds of the company's resource portfolio is thermal, with
the balance mainly run-of-river hydropower units. Concerns about
Chilgener's higher production costs relative to hydro-based competition
are largely offset by growing electrical demand in Chile and Argentina
and by the company's ability to maintain reliable production regardless
of rainfall conditions, says Moody's.

ENERSIS BOOSTS CAPITAL THROUGH MAJOR SHARE OFFER

The holding company, Enersis, which controls Endesa, the power
generator, and Chilectra, the Santiago distributor, has made a $240m
share offering. The 30-day preferential share option lasted to mid-
January.

Demand in the Chilean market, however, has been high and the options
which the private pension funds have been unable to take up because of
legal limits on exposure have been bought up by other shareholders or
future investors.

The capital increase will go towards financing the company's two major
investment projects - its successful bid for 39% of Edesur, the
distribution company which serves the south and centre of Buenos Aires,
and a planned bid for Rio Light of Brazil.

Together with its distribution subsidiary, Chilectra, Enersis paid
$390m for its new stake in Edesur. Short-term financing took the form
of a syndicated loan from five international banks but a bond issue is
expected to follow.

At the end of December, Enersis transferred a 5.6% stake in Edesur to
the local Chispas investment companies for an estimated $55m. The pre-
arranged move is to help diversify the holdings of the Chispas so that
they become eligible for private pension fund investment. Currently,
the Chispas' main asset are their shares in Enersis.

POWER CRISIS DEEPENS

After a year of chaos in electricity sector, with brown-outs of up to
eight hours a day in the second half of last year (PLA4/4, Oct 1995),
Ecuador is settling down to an equally difficult 1996.

The year began about as badly as was possible. In the second week of
January, electricity employees declared a two-day strike in protest at
the government's power sector privatisation bill, which was expected to
be passed by Congress that week.

The bill foresaw the unbundling of generation, distribution and
transmission and the extention of private sector access to the system.
It also proposed the consolidation of the existing 19 distributors in
the country into four or five companies, as well as the restructuring
and sale of 49% of state-run INECEL. Its proposals also included the
creation of a regulatory agency.

The strike, only affecting administrative functions, was threatening
also to hit the country's already disabled power station production as
PLA went to press, notably the Paute hydro plant, which was in the
hands of the strikers and which provides some 60% of the country's
power.

President Sixto Duran Ballen, meanwhile, has ordered the army to take
over the running of the plants should the bill be passed.

The bill, deadlocked in parliament for almost two years, had been
hailed as the solution to the country's deeper capacity problems, by
facilitating the construction of privately-owned plant. Ecuador
currently has 2,300 MW of installed capacity, but only 1,590 MW of
effective, guaranteed capacity, short of the current 1,760 MW of demand
and leaving no margin for the 6% growth forecast for last and this
year.

PERU OUTLINES EXPANSION PLANS

Jorge San Roman, Peruvian vice-minister for energy, is predicting a
further 218 MW expansion of generating capacity in 1996. This should be
enough, he says, to preclude power supply problems - always provided
that rainfall is normal.

The bulk of the extra 218 MW will be made up as follows: 100 MW in the
first phase expansion of Edegel, the recently-privatised collection of
hydro and thermal plants serving Lima; 20 MW from the expansion of
thermal capacity at the Zorritos plant, 60 MW from Pucallpa and 13 MW
from Tarapoto.

Additionally, by early 1997, San Roman expects there will be a further
140 MW available from Ventanilla, Lima's thermal power station which
was acquired in December by Endesa of Spain (PLA 6/18).

In a recent interview, San Roman justified the government's decision to
continue with the exemption from the selective consumption tax (ISC)
for fuel used for thermal electric generation.

"There should be no exceptions to taxes applied", he said, "but in this
case it is necessary, otherwise electricity tariffs would have risen".
He accepted that Peru's increased reliance in the short-term on thermal
energy would mean steeper import bills for diesel.

Not all government officials are as sanguine as the vice-minister over
electricity sector prospects. Luis Haro, director-general for
electricity at the mines ministry, told a conference in early January
that current reserves stood at barely 5% of generating capacity when
they should ideally be at 20%.

MANTARO HYDRO HITS TROUBLE

The Mantaro hydro complex, backbone of electricity generation for
central and northern Peru and scheduled for privatisation in the near
future, is facing serious problems.

Experts predict that, given the precarious state of the concrete lining
of the main, 20km tunnel between the main intake and the machine house,
the jewel in Electroperu's hydro crown may fetch far less than
anticipated when it reaches the auction block later this year or next.

Mantaro comprises two separate hydros known as Santiago Antunez de
Mayolo and Restitucion. Together they account for a quarter of total
national electricity generation capacity.

Mantaro's generating potential is 1,015 MW, with normal output ranging
between 850 and 900 MW. Today it is generating a bare 715 MW due,
according to consultants, to build-up of solids in the tunnel and,
probably, the deterioration of the interior walls. The tunnel has never
been emptied for maintenance work in the 22 years since it opened.
Attempts last year by the Canadian company Aquatic Sciences to carry
out inspections with robots were unsuccessful.

OUTPUT UP 3.3% IN 10 MONTHS

Electricity output rise by 3.3% in the first ten months last year
compared to 1994, reports the Energy and Mines Ministry. Total output
stood at 12,236 GWh, said the report.

It said that electrical production, including output from Peru's
interconnected north-central, southwest, southeast and other isolated
systems reached 11,840 GWh in the January-October period. Power from
hydro plants accounted for 84.6% of total output while thermal power
generation made up 15.4%.

According to the statistics, public service firms produced 10,521 GWh
while companies generating their own captive power accounted for 861.3
GWh. Electroperu, the largest of the country's seven state-owned power
generators, produced 6,332 GWh, followed by recently privatised Edegel,
which had an output of 2,203 GWh, and Egasa 587.8 GWh. Peru's total
output in October rose 2% to 1,233 GWh compared to 1,209 GWh in the
same month in 1994.

* The Peru stock exchange has approved the listing of Edelnor. The
state sold 60% of Edelnor, which distributes power in northern Lima to
a consortium of Chilean, Peruvian and Spanish interests for $176m. The
consortium comprises Inversions Distrilima, led by Enersis, and
Distribuidora Chilectra Metropolitana of Chile and Spain's Endesa.

AGUAYTIA DEAL FORMALISED

A formal agreement has now been signed with a six-company consortium to
develop the Aguaytia gas and related power project.

The project involves the development of the Aguaytia gas field, which
has proven reserves of 223 Bcm; the construction and operation of
natural gas processing facilities,NGL storage facilities,  some 140
miles of gas pipeline and 65 miles of NGL pipeline. A 145 MW gas plant
and 265 miles of transmission lines to connect with the existing grid
system were to be added at a later date.

Only three of the initial four US companies which signed an MOU last
August (PLA 2/20) to develop the $200m complex - El Paso Natural Gas,
Panhandle Eastern Corp and Maple Resources Corp - are still on board.
Entergy, which was to have operated the power plant, has pulled out.
The three new participants are Pennsylvania Light & Power arm, Power
Markets Development Company; Illinois Power arm, Illinova Generating
Company; and Scudder Latin American Power.

Work on the project is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of this
year.

GUYANA POWER SECTOR REHAB PLANS HIT SNAGS

Guyana's urgent effort to rehabilitate its decrepit electricity system
and impose a measure of private commercial discipline (PLA 6/20, Dec
1995) is running into snags.

Trade union pressure last month forced the resignation of Raymond
Gaskin, chairman of the Guyana Electricity Corp. (GEC). He had been
appointed by President Cheddi Jagan himself. The main electricity
union, the National Association of Agricultural, Commercial and
Industrial Employees (NAACIE), had taken exception to the speed with
which Gaskin, with government backing, was trying to commercialise the
operation, including successive power supply rate hikes and the sacking
of up to 213 workers.

NAACIE even called a strike at GEC, illegal in an essential service, to
put pressure on Gaskin to withdraw retrenchment notices. He accused the
union of having a `political agenda' and blamed him for the fact that
`things are not going well at GEC.'

Gaskin said he felt he had no option but to resign after the union fed
`lies' about him to the People's Progressive Party (PPP), the senior
partner in the governing coalition, and to the government itself. The
former chairman can claim some credit for making efforts to improve the
troubled utility, whose performance record is probably the worst in the
Caribbean, with the exception of the Dominican Republic's state-owned
electricity company.

He was instrumental in obtaining additional units from various foreign
sources to reduce the gap between supply and demand, and the rate hikes
enabled GEC to do away with treasury subsidies. he also tried to root
out corruption at the corporation, and several former employees are
before the courts on charges of electricity theft and misuse of GEC
funds.

Gaskin's forced departure is only one of the setbacks facing GEC in its
desperate effort to move forward.

The $12m joint venture between the government-owned bauxite company,
Linden Mining Enterprise (Linmire) and the US Resources Recovery
International, has been put on hold following objections by the
government's privatisation unit. The government unit felt the project
should have been put to tender on a wider basis. The joint venture
company was to install 19 MW of new capacity, 5.5 MW of which would
have been sold to GEC.

The $309m investment by four US companies, trading under the name of
United Health Clinics (UHC), to create power from waste, has also been
stalled.

Senior government officials apparently do not believe the group can
deliver what it says. The proposal was to supply up to 60 MW to the
national grid by using heat generated from all types of local waste.
The government investment promotion agency, the Guyana Office for
Investment (GO-Invest) was in favour of the scheme and seemed satisfied
with the bona fides of the participants. But other officials have
stepped into the picture and demanded better feasibility studies of the
project.

GO-Invest's director, Dr. Ivor Mitchell, says he will pursue the matter
because he has seen waste-to-electricity plants operate successfully in
the US and says "I believe they can work in Guyana".

LOCAL TIE-UP STRENGTHENS BIDDERS CHANCES

The two front runners in the bid to purchase the state-owned Jamaica
Public Service Company, the island's electricity monopoly, have formed
consortia with local companies - a move which bankers say will
strengthen their chances of being selected.

Although the government has an official short list of five prospective
buyers, the two which are considered the leading contenders are Houston
Industries Energy Inc of Texas, and Southern Electric of Georgia. Less
fancied are Enterprise Diversified Holdings and Charter Oak Energy,
both of the US, and Ontario Hydro of Canada.

Southern Electric has created its consortium by drafting Life of
Jamaica and Mutual Life, two of Jamaica's largest life insurances
companies. Houston Industries Energy has been joined by Island Life and
Manufacturers Merchant Bank.

"These arrangements will enhance the chances of the companies in their
bid to purchase the Public Service Company, and the final decision by
the government's Divestment Committee could be influenced by what the
local firms can bring to the table", explained one of Jamaica's leading
bankers who is advising one of the consortia.

Life of Jamaica and Mutual Life are joining Southern Electric as
investors. Island Life will also be an investor with Houston Energy
Industries, while Manufacturers Merchant Bank will provide financial
services support. Southern Electric has also recruited influential
support in the form of Andrew Young, the former US ambassador to the
United Nations and mayor of Atlanta, who has been visiting Jamaica
frequently to lobby for the Atlanta company.

Robert Pickersgill, Jamaica's utilities minister, and several
executives of the Public Service Company, have visited the US
headquarters and major power installations of both Houston Industries
Energy and Southern Electric. Government officials say "nothing of
significance" should be read into the fact the installations of the
other three bidders were not visited.

Jamaican officials are also studying the operations of Trinidad &
Tobago's electricity company in which Southern Electric took a 49%
stake just over a year ago.

The government is hoping that the sale of the power company, which is
scheduled to be concluded by the middle of this year, will be followed
by increased stability in power supplies. The company currently has
capacity of 663 MW and average production is 505 MW to meet peak demand
of 405 MW.

With the commissioning of privately owned barge-mounted and land-based
plants, it will have output for the national grid of well over 700 MW
by August.

Jamaicans will feel the effect of the change in ownership almost as
soon as the sale is complete. The government will require the
successful bidder to modernise and improve the Public Service Company's
efficiency by spending about $800m over 15 years. This will not be
financed solely from the company's operations. It reported a net profit
of $5.8m in the 1994-95 fiscal year, $7.5m less than the previous year.

Company officials have complained, however, that the firm's finances
would have been better had the government granted a tariff increase.
The last increase was granted in 1991, and the government has been
reluctant to make adjustments, apparently because it would be
politically unpopular.

Lee W. Hogan, chief executive of Houston Industries Energy, has warned
that divestment of the Public Service Company will be followed by a
rate increase. If his company's bid were successful, Hogan said, it
would try to curb the hike in rates by selling more power.

"You make more money by selling more energy", he said. "The way to make
money in this business is to maximise growth, not price." An acceptable
rate of return for the company would be between 8.5% and 9% on total
assets, adjusted to debt and interest charges, he said.

The Public Service Company's financial position would have been
stronger in the 1994-95 year, were it not for an explosion at the Old
Harbour Station which destroyed over 100 MW of capacity, said Derrick
Dyer, the company's chief executive. "This is not a fire sale", he said
of the impending divestment. "The company is very much alive and
kicking and, in many respects, is a showpiece for other developing
countries. This is the opinion of international agencies."

MEXICO PUTS ITS CLOCKS FORWARD

Mateo Trevino, who is head of the Mexican government's energy saving
organisation, has one very basic problem.

His job is to convince consumers and producers that wasting electricity
makes no economic sense. But with electricity tariffs that themselves
make little economic sense his task is a difficult one. This year, he
and his organisation, the Support Trust for the Energy Saving Program
(FIDE), have to convince the country to put its clocks forward by an
hour for six months, a change the government thinks will bring about
annual savings of $1.5bn.

A presidential decree establishing Mexican `'summer time" appeared in
the Diario Oficial, Mexico's version of the Federal Register, on
January 4 of this year.

Environmental interest groups and government officials said that the
measure,which will affect Mexico's three time zones from April 7 to
October 27, should save up to 1% of the energy the country currently
uses, through rationalising the use of extended daylight hours. From
1996 on, clocks will be set forward one hour on the first Sunday of
each April and back on the last Sunday of each October.

According to Rogelio Gasca Neri, Director General of Mexico's Federal
Electricity Commission (CFE) the time change should result in fewer air
contaminants being released, as well as more efficient dispersion of
airborn pollutants.

The adoption of summer time is the first step of a six point energy
plan Trevino has the responsibility of promoting. In its entirety, the
plan aims to reduce Mexico's energy consumption by 7.3% by the year
2000 through rationalisation of energy use. By the government's own
reckoning, electricity wastage has already fallen by 5% in recent
years.

As a country with many remaining infrastructure problems and hundreds
of isolated communities, Mexico rations itself when it comes to
executing large scale changes in popular perceptions. A proposal to
introduce summer time in 1992 was brushed aside because at the time the
Mexican government was busy with a programme to re-denominate the
currency.

`'The need to introduce summer time has not been so pressing in Mexico
as it has been in countries further to the north, with greater seasonal
variations in their day", said Trevino. `'But we clearly need to create
a culture of energy conservation.''

Many of the campaigns promoted by Trevino and FIDE aim at the
electricity consumer rather than the producer, such as is the case with
two programmes that seek to introduce the use of more efficient light
bulbs and air conditioners. Revamping existing electricity generation
and transmission equipment to increase efficiency and reduce waste is,
after all, a very costly proposition.

NEW ENERGY MINISTER APPOINTED

A Mexican government reshuffle in the dog days of 1995 took most
commentators by surprise by its timing and heralded changes in the
energy sector.

President Ernesto Zedillo's late December restructuring of his cabinet
removed Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, the former energy secretary, and
something of a member of the ruling party's old guard, replacing him
with Dr Jesus Reyes Heroles, an economist.

Pichardo's position had greatly weakened since he took office a little
more than a year before. Troubled by ill health, and - particularly
during the beginning of his time at the energy ministry - afflicted by
political controversy, Pichardo never seemed the natural choice to
preside over the privatisation and liberalisation of much of Mexico's
energy policy.

At the beginning of 1995, tensions appeared to arise between Pichardo's
energy ministry and the Finance ministry with regard to the future
course of energy privatisations and liberalisation. He will now move on
to a post within the Mexican foreign office, most likely as a diplomat
overseas.

Pichardo's successor, Jesus Reyes Heroles, son of a Mexican politician
from a generation before, won early recognition as head of a Mexican
economics thinktank, Grupo Economistas y Asociaciados.

In the job he held immediately prior to his new appointment, Reyes
Heroles served as head of Banobras, a Mexican state development bank,
where he tried to up investment by innovative schemes including the use
of seed money. Whether he will try similar mechanisms in a sector where
private spending has drawn close to a halt is yet to be determined.

CFE CONFIRMS EXPANSION PLANS

Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) announced that over the
next two years it plans to increase its installed generation capacity
by 2,250 MW, to reach a national total of 35,702 MW to meet national
demand.

In a press release, the CFE emphasised the importance of plans to begin
operating units three through six of the geothermal Cerro Prieto
complex, in Baja California, as well as referring to the 350 MW unit 4
of the coal fired Carbon II programme, in the northern state of
Coahuila, and the thermal combined cycle units 5 and 6 of the Adolfo
Lopez Mateos project, which between them will provide 700 MW for the
town of Tuxpan.

The CFE said that hydroelectric dams will be put into commercial use in
the northwestern state of Sinaloa, where two 200 MW units should come
on-line, as well as between the southern states of Veracruz and Oaxaca,
where the Temascal dam will have two units of 100 MW each, and between
the central areas of Hidalgo and Queretaro, where the Fernando Hiriart
dam will have two units of 140 MW each.

The release said that at the beginning of the Zedillo administration in
December 1994, 1,675 MW of capacity was being tested to be put into
operation, while 2,251 MW was in the process of being contracted or
constructed, all of which should enter into operation before the end of
1997.

During 1995, 1,345 MW was put into operation, leaving 2,581 MW to be
switched on over the next two years.

* Luz y Fuerza del Centro, the main electricity distributor in the
Mexico City area with 24m clients, has contracted the services of
Spain's Union Fenosa Acex to begin a modernisation process. Acex is the
international consultancy arm of Union Fenosa, Spain's third largest
utility.

The contract, which will involve a major technical renovation at Luz y
Central, underlines Fenosa's presence in the region, where it already
has development and technical transfer projects with utilities in the
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Colombia.

ARGENTINA CALLS FOR TENDERS FOR OIL EXPLORATION

Argentina is calling for tenders for oil exploration in seven areas
near disputed waters around the Falkland/Malvinas/Malouines islands.
Tenders will have to be lodged by January 31, says the Energy
Secretariat. Britain withdrew objections last year against oil tenders
in waters bordering its claims after an historic agreement with
Argentina. The agreement allows both countries to charge royalties for
any oil or gas extracted from Falkland waters - Argentina plans to levy
3% and Britain 9% without compromising their conflicting claims to
sovereignty. British Gas and YPF will jointly study hydrocarbon
potential off the islands.

As far as Falkland locals are concerned, there are still tensions, says
Richard Ralph, the new British governor. He said locals do not bear
Argentina any ill-will, despite the 1992 Argentine invasion (and
subsequent eviction with extreme prejudice), but do not wish to have
much, if anything, to do with Argentina so long as sovereignty is
disputed. Despite increased potential for co-operation, notably in
energy and fisheries, Argentines travelling on national passports are
not allowed on the Falklands, apart from relatives visiting the graves
of sons killed in the war.

CALOR GROUP EXPANDING IN LATIN AMERICA

The Calor Group of the UK is further expanding Latin American
operations with a $31m investment in Supergasbras Distribuidora de Gas,
the Brazilian liquified petroleum gas major. The UK group's investment
has been matched by SHV Energy, its joint venture partner in SHV Calor
Brazil, which was set up last year. Calor and SHV are spending $62m for
a 49% stake in Supergas and 50% of the voting rights. Supergas lost
$4.2m in 1994.

Calor was in the news last August with the acquisition of a majority
stake in Minasgas, a bottled gas supplier. It is understood Supergas
and Minasgas will be operated as separate companies. Calor said it
would encourage rival suppliers to draw up a co-operation arrangement
for the future. The two companies supply a combined total of 1.35mt of
LPG to a customer base of 40m people. Calor announced last year plans
to spend #70m ($110m) in projects in Latin America and Asia in
conjunction with SHV Energy, the privately-held Dutch group with
ultimately controls Calor. The strategy is to broaden Calor's base
outside the UK market.

ENAP ANNOUNCES PROFITS IN 1995

ENAP, Chile's state oil company, has announced profits of $110m in
1995, with production at approaching 600,000 cubic metres. In 1996, it
plans to invest $160m on expanding its two refineries, improving the
quality of its products and on exploration, mostly in other countries.
An agreement with Petroecuador to develop a joint exploration programme
is expected to be announced soon.

PIPELINE MAY NOT GO AHEAD

Hondo Oil & Gas of the US is expressing fears that a natgas pipeline
planned by it and Amoco may not go ahead because of changes in pipeline
tariffs and natgas prices. The company said also that its Opon No. 5
development well has been delayed indefinitely because of right-of-way
disputes with landowners. Hondo said the Comision de Regulacion de
Energia y Gas had set a ceiling price for natgas and a maximum rate of
return of 12.5% (before local taxes) for pipeline tariffs. The ceiling
is interpreted to include costs or fees for the processing of natgas,
thus processing costs cannot be passed on to buyers.

As a consequence, these regulations "will reduce the amount the company
expects to receive for natgas and pipeline tariffs in the future", the
company said. The regulations affect the terms agreed to in a MOU with
Ecopetrol for the construction of a pipeline and the sale of natgas.
The agreement was signed on July 31. It calls for an 88 km pipeline
from the contract area to Ecopetrol's refinery at Barrancabermeja.
Negotiations are continuing with Ecopetrol to seek relief from the
regulations so the project can be got under way.

COLOMBIAN CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION

Crude oil production averaged 583,428 bbl per day in 1995, a 28.5% rise
over daily production of 454,020 bbl in 1994, says Ecopetrol.
Production in December was below the annual average at 579,060. Foreign
oil companies accounted for most of the output, producing an average of
458,632 b/d last year, up from 328,155 b/d the year before.

ECOPETROL PLANS TO INVEST $4.7BN

Ecopetrol plans to invest $4.7bn over the next five years, says the
company. Some $2.2bn of this will be invested in its association
contracts with foreign companies, with $1.3bn allocated to the Cusiana
and Cupiagua fields alone - $620m in 1996, reducing to $47.5m in 2000.
A further $1bn will be invested in refining and petrochemicals, and
$773.9m in exploration and production.

BP'S COLOMBIAN OIL AND GAS RESERVES

Good news for BP in Colombia where oil and gas reserves are now much
larger than originally estimated. BP will be producing 1m bbl of oils
within 10 years, slightly less than what comes out of the UK sector of
the North Sea. BP is staying mum but did acknowledge that output from
the Cusiana-Cupiagua field was rising fast and that 500,000 b/d could
be in production by end-1997. Last month's production would be 180,000
b/d, up from 40,000 b/d in 1994. Guerrilla activity remains a threat
and are estimated to have caused $45m in damage to pipeline and other
facilities since 1986.

ECOPETROL TO ATTEMPT TO SELL ITS STAKE IN PROMIGAS

Ecopetrol is to make a second attempt to sell its stake in natgas
distributor Promigas, with an offer of 38.87% of the company on January
24 at Ps2,800 per share. The shares include 24.99% owned directly by
Ecopetrol and 13.88% owned by Explotaciones Condor. Ecopetrol first
tried to sell the stake locally to employees, pension funds and co-
operatives at the end of 1995. In September 1994, it sold 3.29% of the
company, whose other shareholders include the IFC (11.79%) and
financier Corfivalle (9.82%). The sale is part of a wider divestment of
$235m of Ecopetrol's non-operational assets in 1996.

CUBA HOPES TO PRODUCE MORE CRUDE THIS YEAR

Cuba hopes to produce some 1.5mt, or about 11.3m bbl, of crude this
year, fractionally up from last year's figure of 1.45mt and 1.28mt the
previous year. Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, said the
increased production was due to new technology and injection of capital
and resources through linkups with foreign companies. Current
production was less than one-fifth of the country's total needs of
about 7.5mt a year. Cupet, the Cuban petroleum company, has been on an
investment drive overseas in an attempt to line up more joint ventures
with foreign oil exploration groups.

GOVERNMENT NAMES PRESIDENT OF PETROECUADOR

The government has named Patricio Lopez, an army general, as president
of Petroecuador. Lopez is a former aide-de-camp to President Sixto
Duran Bailen. He succeeds Federico Veintimilla, who stepped down
recently along with top managers after allegations of mismanagement.
Petroecuador produces 330,000 b/d of the Andes nation's 380,000 b/d. It
is now undergoing a major restructuring as a result of the top-level
cleanout, which led to the resignation of all managers at Petroecuador
subsidiaries, such as Petroproduccion, Petrocomercial and
Petroindustrial.

The alleged irregularities were in connection with the purchase of
27.5m gallons of diesel from Hiperoil, a local company which had
imported it from Venezuela. Hiperoil is claimed to have added undue
taxes to the sale price for a profit of 30bn sucres ($10.2m), reports
Reuters.

MEXICAN ENERGY MINISTER TO PRESS AHEAD WITH MODERNISATION

President Ernesto Zedillo has called on Jesus Reyes Heroles, the new
Energy Minister, to press ahead with a modernisation of the sector. He
said Jesus Reyes' main responsibility "will be to promote a rapid
expansion of the energy sector" and stimulating a quicker modernisation
of state-owned companies. Mexico is destined to sell a large part of
its petrochem industry this year. It has been under the control of
Petroleos Mexicanos. The country has already liberalised the natural
gas sector and expects billions of dollars in investment in natgas
transportation as well as in new power plants.

PROPOSAL TO DEVELOP GAS FIELD IN NORTHERN MEXICO

A consortium of US firm Conoco, Canada's Nova Corp and Canadian Hunter
Exploration have presented a proposal to develop a potentially enormous
natural gas field in northern Mexico, according to a report in the Wall
Street Journal. Under the terms of the proposal, made several months
ago, the group would agree a long-term service contract with Petroleos
Mexicanos (Pemex) to explore for and produce gas at Burgos Basin,
bordering Texas. The companies, which would be equal partners in the
deal, would initially invest $100m in the project.

If successful, the proposal, said to be in a very early stage of
discussion, would be taken as a signal that Mexico may relax its
restrictions on foreign involvement in the energy sector. Mexican law
currently forbids foreign ownership of its energy resources.

PETROPERU PLANS TO CUT WORKFORCE

Petroperu plans to cut its workforce before a stage-by-stage
privatisation later this year, the company says. "The programme . . .
foresees the retirement of excess personnel, to whom an economic
incentive will be given as well as legal benefits", it said. The idea
was to make the company's various divisions more efficient before
privatisation. Officials would not say how many of the company's 5,500
workers were likely to go, but speculation is that numbers could be cut
by 1,000 by July.

PERU'S OIL PRODUCTION

Peru's oil production fell 4.36% in 1995 from an average of 127,309 bpd
to 121,762 bpd, according to a report from regulatory agency Perupetro.
The fall was blamed on problems over the past few months with the
depletion of old wells before new wells came on-stream. Officials
expect the situation to improve in 1996, following last year's
signature of deals with foreign oil producers, and the start of a four-
year privatisation programme for Petroperu.

The country produced a total of 44.44m barrels in 1995 compared to
46.47m in 1994, said the report, with some 95.1% produced by state oil
firm Petroperu (14.54m bbl), Petro-Tech (7.09m) and US firm Occidental
Petroleum (20.64m). Private contractors accounted for the remaining
4.9%.

PDVSA PLANS TO INCREASE CRUDE RESERVES

PDVSA plans to increase crude reserves to 66bn bbl in 1996 from 64.4bn
this year, said PDVSA at its annual general meeting. It said it plans
to invest Bol 1.7 trillion next year ($5.86bn at the new official
exchange rate of Bol 290 per dollar in effect since December 11), up
from Bol 901.9m in 1995 ($3.1bn). Most investment will go into
production and exploration, said a company statement.

PDVSA said the programme will allow it to meet production targets "and
increase in 1996 proven reserves of crude to about 66bn bbl, or 1.6bn
more than 1995". PDVSA gave no figures for projected crude output
capacity or the budget that was approved. The company said recently
that its average production was rising to 5.659m b/d by 2005 compared
to 3.157m b/d now.

PDVSA expects oil output to be boosted further by the current
liberalisation programme. The company expects output from the ten
blocks being auctioned to reach at least 500,000 bpd by 2005, according
to president Luis Giusti. Some 60 companies in 20 consortia have bid
for the estimated $11bn of profit-sharing contracts. At the time of
going to press, two winners had been announced - a consortium of Mobil,
Veba and Nippon with a bid of $104m for La Ceiba tract, and Conoco,
bidding $21.2m for a second tract. The remaining concessions will be
announced by the end of January, with exploration beginning possibly by
the last quarter of1996.

VENEZUELA'S AMUAY REFINERY RECORD

Venezuela's Amuay refinery, the country's largest, processed 471,000
b/d last year, a 41,000 b/d rise over 1994, says Lagoven, a subsidiary
of PDVSA. It said that 100,000 b/d were heavy crude, which represented
a new record for the refinery, located in Falcon state. Venezuela
processed an average 972,000 b/d in 1994, say the latest figures. At
the same time, the Eastern Cyrogenic Complex, run by Corpoven, produced
an average of 34m b/d of LNG in 1995, up 9% over 1994. The PDVSA
subsidiary exported an average of 11m b/d of its LNG output, the
remaining 23m b/d sold domestically.

LITTLECHILD REDIRECTS 1998 PLAN

The Regulator has told the Pool and the ESI that it must redirect
efforts to finding a workable and economic arrangement for introducing
full competition in April 1998. He says that the estimated costs of
implementing and running the Pool's proposed Operational Framework are
neither reasonable nor necessary. Offer has proposed a number of
simplifications that it believes will facilitate implementation and
reduce costs. It believes that implementation costs should not exceed
#50m, while subsequent operating costs should be around #15m. These
costs are about one fifth of the Pool's estimates.

The difference in cost estimates reflects two factors:

* a real cost saving arising from abandoning some of the more complex
and expensive systems, most particularly the Pool's proposed
registration system;

* the Regulator's judgement that some of the costs incurred by the PESs
relate to activities that would in any case have to be carried out by
PESs in discharging their duties as distribution companies. Many of
these costs have already been provided for or else the additional costs
are not significant.

In addition to slashing the implementation costs that the industry will
be allowed to cover, Offer has told the industry that customers should
not face any additional charges before 1998. It recommends that
implementation costs should be recovered over five years from April
1998, with all <100kW customers paying in relation to their
consumption. The current non franchise sector would not have to
contribute to the implementation or running costs.

In many ways Offer's recommendations echo the call by a number of RECs
for a major re-think on how best to implement the 1998 project. Three
RECs, Southern Electric, Yorkshire Electricity and Midlands
Electricity, had in late December put forward an alternative framework,
which was dubbed the SYM proposal. This group called for the ESI to
abandon the implementation of the Pool's Operational Framework. It
argued that the industry should switch now, before it was too late, to
a simpler and more manageable programme that could be implemented in
time and yet would meet all the primary objectives.

The SYM plan backers are uncompromising in their criticism of the ESI's
current 1998 plans. They argued that the "Operational Framework
proposals are unlikely to be delivered on time. With a development cost
of #276m (+100%.-50%) and some #80m/yr to operate, it is so expensive,
it makes it very difficult for companies to accept. It also undermines
the benefit available to customers from competition."

They say that a simpler framework is needed in order to meet time-
scales. This must use existing systems, procedures and practices
wherever possible. Not only would this make implementation of full
competition a more manageable task, it would also substantially reduce
costs. They argue that there is no time to lose in pushing forward with
the alternative.

Offer's proposals

Stream-lined registration

Offer thinks that the Pool's registration system is unnecessarily
complex and that it would be more appropriate for the PES to provide a
registration service to meet the requirements of suppliers and the Pool
for all consumers in its area. It is prepared to propose licence
amendments to ensure that the PES fulfil these activities.

The Pool's proposed on-line registration system - the so-called Trading
System Data Provision (TSDP) and its associated Gateway - is generally
regarded as one of the more complex systems the Pool has proposed. The
TSDP would be made up of regional satellite databases (one per REC)
holding data necessary for trading. A common access path to the data
(the so-called Gateway) would allow all suppliers to access the data.
It is envisaged that eventually the system will provide on-line access.

The Regulator proposes a much simpler system based on a unique
identifier for every metering site, which would be printed on all
customers bills and would provide suppliers and others with necessary
information. PES would be responsible for assigning this metering
system identifier (MSID), which would give information on the
distribution exit point, profile, line loss factor and meter reading
frequency and perhaps other data. PESs would maintain databases of all
customers in their area as well as provide a service to respond to
enquiries from customers and suppliers. Suppliers would have an
obligation to alert the PES to any change, and in particular to
register their responsibility for supply to any premises. The PES
databases would also provide the Pool with standing data it requires
for settlement.

Regulatory safeguards, such as performance standards and penalties, are
likely to be required to ensure prompt and non discriminatory provision
of information.

Profiling

Offer accepts the Pool's proposals for eight profiles for 100kW
customers. And while its says that assignment of profiles has not been
a contentious issue, customers and suppliers should have the right to
seek independent determination where there is a dispute. The eight
profiles comprise two profiles each for domestic and smaller non-
domestic customers (unrestricted and Economy 7) and four profiles
(based on load factors) for larger non-domestic customers supplied
through conventional maximum demand metering.

Settlement

Under the Pool's current arrangements metered half hour data and
profiled data for all second tier customers is provided to the Pool's
agents for settlement, while first tier consumption is evaluated on a
grid supply point (GSP) basis as the difference between total second
tier use and total GSP take, suitably scaled for losses. The Pool's PTA
is that the existing arrangements for second tier data will continue
while PESs will be able to choose the basis by which they will submit
first tier consumption data to settlements. The option of continuing
the existing "differencing" approach has not been allowed for, as it
was considered to place too great a risk on PESs, should large numbers
of customers opt for second-tier suppliers.

Instead, the PTA allows the PES to select one of three trading options:

* Global: where the host PES submits customer data on an individual
site basis both for initial settlement and reconciliation, on the same
basis as second-tier suppliers;

* Super customer: where the host PES submits aggregated data for one or
more profile groups to initial settlement and reconciliation;

* Hybrid-difference: where the host PES submits individual customer
data on a global basis at initial settlement, but at the reconciliation
stage only meter data from second-tier customers is used.

The global approach is the most demanding in IT terms - if all RECs
adopted this approach settlement systems would have to handle data on
23m sites. The hybrid-difference approach is the most easiest, as most
of the aggregated data is not processed for Pool use. The super
customer lies in between.

As the amount of data provided for settlement increases so does the
cost, but this must be offset against reduced differencing risk. The
Pool's costings assume that all RECs adopt the global approach, in
order to avoid differencing risk.

Offer says that this is unreasonable and given the balance between
costs and risks there is no justification for adopting the global
option. Indeed in the initial period, Offer proposes that PESs must
stay with the existing differencing approach. It adds that PESs
pursuing the super customer or hybrid difference approach will not be
given an extra revenue allowance to meet the additional costs it and
the Pool incurs.

PESs should be obliged to provide data aggregation services to all
suppliers operating in their area on a non-discriminatory basis.
Suppliers could then decide whether to provide the data aggregation
service to the Pool themselves or through an independent accredited
agent or sub-contract their requirement to the host REC.

Half-hourly metering in reconciliation

The Pool's PTA allows for half hour metered data to be delivered to
outside settlement timescales. The Regulator endorses this as it allows
customers to benefit from half hour metering without installing on-line
communications. This will allow a wider range of tariffs than can be
offered to customers and will reduce the reliance on profiling
techniques for larger customers under 100kW.

Competition in metering and data collection

Offer has re-affirmed its view that suppliers should take
responsibility for metering and data collection in 1998. However in the
non half hourly metered sector of the market, the Offer has endorsed
the Pool's recommendation for a two-year transitional arrangement. This
will involve the supplier sub-contracting to the local PES (or its
agent), those data collection functions that are related to
conventional meters, at least in so far as they are necessary for
trading system purposes. Offer envisages that PESs would enter into
bilateral contracts with suppliers, which would set out the terms upon
which the data collection service would be provided. Any dispute about
terms would be subject to determination by the Regulator.

Parallels with SYM line

In essence the SYM proposal involves applying the existing trading
arrangements to all customers with half-hourly on-line meters, while
assigning responsibility for all other customers to the RECs
distribution businesses. Like Offer, the SYM scheme involves replacing
the Pool's centralised registration system with a simple one based on
PES distribution businesses, while the existing settlement process,
supplemented by a local aggregation and reconciliation system, will be
retained. PESs would continue to trade on the basis of differencing, as
Offer proposes for the initial period.

The Pool would continue to clear on a daily basis. All half-hour meter
data will continue to be processed through the current central
settlements system. This will include all the additional data from
mandatory and non-mandatory half hour meters.

For all non half-hour data, the REC distribution business would provide
a data aggregation and reconciliation service for all supply customers
in its area. Distributors would provide initial estimates of annual
consumption that will be used for settlement purposes. These estimates
would be updated following receipt of physical meter reading, validated
customer own readings or estimates carried out by the RECs' existing
estimating process.

Aggregated data would be fed to the initial settlement. This would be
carried out on a calender basis. In this way it would spread the
profile and line loss risk across all suppliers.

The reconciliation process, carried out between the host PES and second
tier suppliers, would be synchronised with the meter reading data flows
that feed it. The host PES would have to accept the difference risk,
which applies to a small margin between the published and out-turn line
loss factors. These would be small.

Unlike the Pool's proposal the SYM plan would not allow customers to
trade on the basis of half hourly data unless it is provided on-line
within settlement timescales. The SYM backers argue that since few
>100kW customers have chosen to take supply on multi-rate terms, the
gains from continuing to allow half hourly data to be processed outside
timescales, would be outweighed by the savings due to the simplified
settlement task. They point out that it would not be possible to cater
for data delivered outside settlement timescales due to the
differencing principle at reconciliation.

They say that their proposals would enable new suppliers to give
reliable quotations to prospective customers without direct involvement
with the existing supplier or distributor. Equally, the SYM backers
acknowledge that the main disadvantage is the reliance of non host PES
suppliers on effective regulation of host PESs' systems and procedures.
However these concerns can be addressed by appropriate licence
amendments and performance standards. SYM point out that suppliers
would be able verify meter readings on Pool statements against those
contained within DUoS (distribution use of system) statements.

On competition in data collection and metering in the conventional
metering segment, the SYM backers say that while the PES should retain
responsibility for this, there is no reason why actual data collection
and meter operation should not be carried out by third parties. This
would have to be subject to:

* current meter data flow being preserved (in other words the data
collector will have to send data to host REC - the data is anyway
required for billing suppliers' distribution use of system charge);

* data collector and meter operator parties having proper accreditation
and complying with codes of practice;

* maintenance of a evenly loaded quarterly cycle of data processing
(which might imply some data being stored prior to processing). This is
necessary in order that the reconciliation system is not overloaded.

Costs and risks

The cost saving in IT systems of the Offer and SYM alternative
frameworks are huge. The largest savings stem from the removal of the
need to develop new data collection and delivery systems, and to
provide half-hour profile data to the Pool trading system. In addition,
there would be savings in reduced programme management costs and trial
costs. While Offer puts the total implementation costs at under #50m,
SYM's estimate is #89m, and for a system that is more trimmed down than
Offer's. Similarly, SYM's estimate of annual operating costs, c.#25m is
substantially above Offer's.

Simplifying the operational framework will also ease the task of
implementing it, in terms of making development of IT systems more
manageable and also in terms of reducing legal re-drafting of the
Pooling and Settlement Agreement and other arrangement.

The SYM operational framework

Customer driven registration:

* Customer provides new supplier with information from bill.
* New supplier confirms supply to customer.
* New supplier registers customer with host PES registration
  service.
* New supplier sets up billing record.
* Host PES registration service registers change/Notifies previous
  supplier.
* Meter reading decided (actual, customer own, agreed estimate).
* PES calculates DUoS bill.
* PES sends termination DUoS account to previous supplier.
* Previous supplier sends supply termination account to customer.

Cyclical meter reading:

* Host PES meter reading (actual, customer own, agreed estimate).
* Host PES send meter reading to supplier.
* Supplier calculates supply bill.
* Supplier sends supply bill.
* PES calculates DUoS bill.
* PES sends DUoS bill to supplier.
* PES settlement module derives reconciliation amounts and submits
  to the Pool's agents Energy Pool Funds Administration Limited
  (EPFAL).
* EPFAL clears reconciliation amounts.

Calendar-settlement timescales:

* Existing settlement arrangements applied to half hour metered
  customers.
* SSA provides differences between GSP and line loss factor adjusted
  half-hourly metered data to PES settlement module.
* PES settlement module submits supplier aggregates by profile to
  SSA.
* SSA bills suppliers and pays generators for initial settlement via
  EPFAL.

Industry and customer reaction

The industry has still to digest the Regulator's proposals, which have
taken many by surprise. Many are pleased that Offer is taking a more
proactive stance and that it has at last outlined the principles for
cost recovery. But there is widespread feeling among the PES that Offer
has slashed too deeply into the PESs allowable implementation and
operating costs. Yorkshire's Bill Wilkinson, told Power UK that "On
first impressions, Offer's disallow any extra spend by distribution
businesses, which could be significant, is harsh especially if it
adopts an inflexible approach on ring fencing distribution and supply
businesses".

A number of PESs will certainly be unhappy that Offer will only meet
the costs of trading on a differencing basis, rather than meeting the
costs of alternative, more data-demanding, settlements arrangements.

National Power, PowerGen and the aspiring independent suppliers are
likely to welcome the Offer proposals, if they believe that they will
reduce the costs to customers of taking competitive supply. It does not
matter to them that PESs may find it difficult to keep costs to the
allowed levels, as long as the PES can deliver the required
registration and data aggregation services. However they are concerned
that no key competition elements should be lost in the effort to
simplify. NP's commercial director, Graham Brown told Power UK, "NP
welcomes any proposal that leads to lower costs that will eventually
feed through to the customer, but the industry must be careful not to
over simplify as this could jeopardise competition. We will be studying
the proposals closely".

Customers' representatives and buyers' groups are likely to support the
tougher Offer stance if it reduces the costs of taking competitive
supply. Yvonne Constance, the chair of the Electricity Consumers
Committee, backs the Regulator's decision to allow PESs to start
recovering implementation costs from 1998 rather than in advance.

Larger >100kW customers will be pleased that Offer has proposed that
PESs will be able to recover the implementation costs for 1998 from the
<100kW consumers. Also they will take some satisfaction that Offer has
told the PES that there should be no disruption in the trading
arrangements for the >100kW sector. The Utility Buyers Forum (UBF) only
last week called for a two-year postponement of the 1998 project on the
grounds that there were too many unresolved issues and too little time
to implement the necessary changes. Alan Mitchell Rae, UBF's director
general, said "that many of our members have sites which can
potentially benefit from competition but would rather have an orderly
transition and postpone these benefits than see more major upset
throughout the market."

UBF also say that neither the Regulator nor ESI had yet made a firm
business case for extending competition to residential customers. There
was instead an ideological commitment. According to Bob Spears, UBF's
electricity technical adviser, "its rather like the government
declaring that the UK will join the Single European Currency in 1998,
whatever the costs and benefits and whatever the level of
preparedness".

ESI WARNED OF "POLL TAX ON WIRES"

The ESI's current plans for introducing full competition in 1998 are so
deeply flawed that they could present a "poll tax on wires", according
to a new report by Alex Henney. Henney warns that the systems the Pool
and Offer have in mind are unnecessarily complex and costly, and that
the gains to be had from competition do not justify building a huge
centralised settlement system. He adds that, as with complex IT
systems, there is a more than even chance that they will exceed budget
and will not be more than ready in time. The solution, according to
Henney, is to ditch the current centralised system and develop a
decentralised system based on PESs' distribution businesses.

That this criticism should come Henney - a well known advocate of free
markets, an astute independent thinker, and former Electricity Council
economist, makes it all the more pertinent. That its conclusions are
largely endorsed by the breakaway RECs and now even Offer gives it a
radical manifesto flavour.

ESI's 1998 costs outweigh competition benefits

Henney contends that even if the Pool can contain the implementation
and running costs to the targets set out in its Operational Framework,
the costs may outweigh the benefits from competition. Adding the
operating costs (#80m) to the development costs (#250m, amortised over
four years on a 10% discount rate) and dividing by the number of
customers (23m), yields an annual cost per customer of #5.80. These
costs are about double the level implied by the Regulator, who has
stated that the costs are unlikely to exceed 1% of customers' bills,
which average #300/yr.

What riles Henney is the singular failure of the Regulator or industry
to examine the benefits side of the equation. Henney points out that it
is disengenuous to cite the reductions in prices that followed either
the  opening of the 1MW or 100kW markets as deriving from the effects
of head-to-head competition. The reductions owe more to the fact that
customers no longer had to subsidise British Coal through the REC's
vesting or "coal deal" contracts; and in 1994 to the imposition of
Offer's Pool price cap.

Henney argues that in order to see what the potential gains are it is
necessary to focus on the energy and supply business component of
bills. For a typical domestic customer these components amount to
#157/yr. The great bulk of this is energy (generation costs) with just
#27 accounted for by the supply business, including an average supply
margin of #7.40. This average does of course disguise a range of supply
costs, in the order of #10 for a customer on direct debit to #60 for a
poorly paying credit customer. There is also some variation between
RECs' franchise revenue allowances.

In theory, competition in supply will force suppliers:

* to reduce supply costs by improving efficiency in marketing and
billing through smarter IT systems or by sharing operations with other
utilities. Henney suggests that higher cost RECs could cut costs by 15%
(#6) while lower cost companies might trim costs by 10% (#3).

* to trim margins. The scope for trimming is extremely small given the
small margins: margins on domestic customers are unlikely to be much
over #5.

* to purchase energy more efficiently. With no data available on RECs'
purchasing skills/luck, Henney suggests that perhaps #1-2 might be
available. In addition, some RECs with expensive long-term IPP
contracts will no longer be able to pass the costs on customers, but
will be forced to take the above market cost on their supply business
bottom line. For a few RECs this could amount to #3.00 per typical
domestic customer.

Summing these potential benefits, gives a maximum potential reduction
of #11/customer (where the customer is served by a high cost REC and
poor buying). Expressed as a percentage of the typical bill this saving
is equivalent to 4% of the total bill (7% of energy costs). In an
average REC, potential savings may be nearer #7 or 3% of the total
bill.

These potential saving are not much greater than the costs, which
amount to near #6/customer. On this basis the potential net customer
benefit of competition is perhaps #2-3/customer. Henney questions,
whether in practice even these gains will be realised. Competition will
only bring price reductions where customers are prepared to switch to
take advantage of lower prices. The limited evidence that exists from
other commodity/utility markets and from other countries (most notably
Norway) suggests that the 3-4% savings on offer is unlikely to tempt
many residential customers buying singly to move. Unless residential
buyers are willing to delegate their purchasing to agencies purchasing
for many customers, it is difficult to see many domestic customers
gaining from competition.

Indeed, if the costs of the new systems come out nearer the top end of
the Pool's contingency forecast range (at c.#500m) most domestic
customers will pay for competition. Henney warns that residential
customers may not actually become aware of this situation, as these
increases should be more than offset by reductions elsewhere. The
biggest gain is likely to come with the ending of the RECs' coal backed
franchise contracts.

Complex systems don't always work

The cost-benefit balance looks even worse if the risks of system
failure are factored in. Henney warns that complex IT systems rarely
come in on time, to budget and without operational gliches. He cites
one recent survey of IT programmes in 200 organisations which showed
that 90% of projects were over budget, 60% delivered late and 20%
inappropriate for the task. In recent years there have been notable IT
failures including major system developed for the DHSS, Inland Revenue,
the London Ambulance Service and the Stock Exchange. The Pool's own
experience, albeit so far on a more modest scale, has hardly been
impressive. The Transmission Service Scheme implemented last year to
manage Uplift overshot its target cost by 150%. The proposed settlement
and registration systems are much more complex.

Regulator is key to forcing progress

Like many in the industry, Henney is also concerned about who, if
anyone, is taking responsibility for designing and implementing the
systems for full competition in 1998. He points out that the ESI has no
legal obligation nor financial allowance to design and develop the
systems for 1998. It is the Regulator who has the obligation to
"promote competition in the supply of electricity" and who also has
legal power to propose the necessary commercial framework.

Henney points out that a REC's primary duty is to its shareholders. In
fact it has a duty not to commit funds until such time as licences
obligations require it to do so. And they certainly cannot spend their
customers' money without Offer's authorisation, but as yet Offer has
made no allowance. This is hardly taking a proactive stance, as the
Regulator claims.

Build systems on PES distribution

Henney says that the Regulator should take control and reconstruct an
alternative streamlined programme based on existing distribution
business systems. He proposes an alternative systems that will:

* allow anyone to have half-hourly meters, and allow data to be
processed within or outside settlement timescales;

* build the necessary registration systems on the current system
developed for the current non-franchise market;

* produce pseudo half-hour data with a handful of profiles in the
manner currently proposed;

* use PES distribution businesses to effect local settlement and
reconciliation.

Henney says that adopting such an approach is not a jump into the
unknown, as Norway has already implemented such a system. And under the
current competitive market arrangements, RECs already know to whom each
meter relates and who the suppliers are as they have to recover DUoS
(distribution use of system) charges from suppliers.

Daily settlement through GSP (grid supply points) which is required by
the Pooling and Settlement Agreement (PSA) could be done for profiled
customers by RECs distribution businesses (for a fee) on behalf of all
suppliers in its area. The difference between profiled and metered
supply and final metered use (scaled for losses) would be allocated
proportionally among suppliers.

ENRON APPLIES FOR SUPPLY LICENCE

Enron has applied to the DTI for a second-tier supply licence for
England and Wales. It lodged its application on January 12. If it is
awarded a licence, which should be a formality, it will be able to
offer supply terms to any >100kW customer. The company is already
active in the gas supply business and would be expected to operate a
joint gas and electricity marketing operation.

Enron's application follows Norsk Hydro's successful application for
an STS licence on January 10. NH is now setting up an electricity
trading and supply arm, Norsk Hydro Energi (UK), under the direction of
Jamie Hamilton. Hamilton says he expects NHE to offer and trade CfDs
(contracts for differences) including EFAs (electricity forward
agreements).

NH has already has considerable experience as a supplier and trader in
the Nordic electricity market, which is of comparable size to the UK
market.

Hamilton joined NHE in December from National Power, where he was the
fuel strategy manager. Prior to that he was at Shell.

NH also has manufacturing interests in the UK, and around 2,000
employees.
Contact: Jamie Hamilton, Norsk Hydro Energi (UK), Tel. 0181 255 2510.

BG/HE GO AHEAD WITH SEABANK

British Gas and Hydro-Electric announced on January 22 that they had
formed a 50:50 joint venture, Seabank Power Limited (SPL), which will
construct and operate a 755MW CCGT plant at Avonmouth. The backers say
that the plant will be designed to operate profitably in the mid merit
segment of the market.

The total capital cost of the project is expected to #315m, which will
be funded equally by HE and BG, through a mix of shareholder loans and
equity in an 85:15 split.

HE has signed a power purchase agreement under which it will buy all
the electricity produced by the plant for the first 10.5 years. The
company will  also be responsible for providing fuel to SPL from its
gas portfolio, which has been augmented by a new contract with BG. This
additional gas is understood to have been purchased under a contract
that links the delivered gas price to electricity prices (Pool and
contract). This suggests that HE will be transferring a significant
part of the electricity price risk through to BG.

Siemens has been awarded the turnkey contract for design and
construction, with commercial operation scheduled for late 1998. The
plant will be based on two Siemens V94.3a 250MW gas turbines and a
single 255MW steam turbine, which will give an overall efficiency of
over 55% (on an LHV ISO basis). Firing will be solely by natural gas,
with no distillate backup.

The design configuration does allow space for further units. However,
the partners point out that the current 755MW represents the most
appropriate configuration, given the changing market circumstances
which have seen Seabank project scaled down from a >1.3GW baseload
scheme.

MISSION/EASTERN VIE FOR NP PLANT

Mission Energy is now the City's favourite to win control of the 4GW of
National Power coal capacity following the company's winning bid for
First Hydro. At more than #150m above the next highest bid, Mission's
winning bid is regarded as a strategic entry bid. Many in the City
believe that this acquisition is likely to feed Mission's hunger for
more capacity and a broader portfolio of plant. Industry sources, in
contrast still tend to put Eastern Group as favourite, as it too has
considerable financial muscle and strong ambitions to play a bigger
role in the UK generation sector.

AES and Enron are considered to be outside runners in the contest,
although both have significant interests in the UK generation sector.
But these companies should not be ruled out. Enron has always presented
itself as a clean generation company, so it was something of a surprise
when it declared an interest in the NP coal plant. While Enron have not
confirmed it, most observers (Power UK included) have assumed that
Enron interest in the plant on offer, is driven by the options for
converting or repowering the plant to run on gas.

NP's conversion of two sets at Didcot (1,000MW) indicates that NP at
least thinks there is an economic case for dual firing capability.
However, none of the three stations (West Burton, Ironbridge and
Rugeley) have connections to the gas network (as Didcot has), so the
conversion cost is likely to be somewhat more than the c.#10m (#10/kW)
for Didcot. But even if the cost were double or treble, a conversion
might pay, especially if low cost gas could be secured.

The gas break-even price with coal bought on the spot market (as
opposed to the headline "coal deal" price) is likely to be around 11-
12p a therm. This is achievable at present, but it would be a brave
investor who would count on prices remaining at current levels. This
suggests that if the plants are to have a future burning gas they will
have to be upgraded, which implies a commitment to invest much bigger
sums than a simple conversion. By installing gas turbines and modifying
the boilers and steam turbines, it would be possible to convert the
stations into combined cycle stations. Operating in this mode the
stations could achieve efficiencies of 45-48%, compared with about 38%
running in single cycle mode. The extra efficiency points would give a
higher break-even gas price versus coal, but then it comes at a
substantial investment price, some #200m for West Burton.

Switching to gas would, of course, bring considerable environmental
benefits, most particularly in reducing sulphur dioxide emissions.

PG BRINGS ON DISTA PRODUCTS CHP

PowerGen CHP has commissioned its 10MWe/16MWt combined heat and power
at Dista Products' Merseyside site two months ahead of schedule and
just over 15 months after construction started. The plant will be
operated by PG CHP for 10 years under a total energy management
contract. It comprises two 5MW Typhoon gas turbines provided by
European Gas Turbines and two waste heat boilers each supplying 11.5
tonnes of steam an hour.

PG CHP has also announced that it has won a contract to provide a #23m
gas fired CHP plant at Conoco's oil refinery on the Humber estuary. The
plant's four gas turbines will be supplied with natural gas by a spur
from the main Killingholme-Theddlethorpe line.

NT ALARMED BY ABB INTENTIONS

The National Trust (NT) has reacted with alarm to an approach by ABB
that it develop a 720MW CCGT on NT land adjoining an Exeter substation.
ABB argued that the plant could be appropriately designed and
landscaped to minimise visual impact. By siting the plant next to the
substation, the project would also avoid the need for further intrusive
transmission lines. This didn't wash with NT, which said that large-
scale power generation was incompatible with the NT's goal of
stewardship.

ABB says that the Exeter project had been little more than plucked off
the map - and the approach to NT the land-owners was the first time
that ABB had revealed its intentions. While it may represent a
misjudgment it certainly does not represent a setback for the company.
More importantly, it does indicate that generators are actively looking
for sites in the capacity-short zones of the Grid.

US oil giant Amoco, is also considering entering the UK generation
market. The company's electricity subsidiary, Amoco Power Resources
posted an invitation to tender for turnkey for a 250MW CCGT. Amoco told
Power UK that the company has several potential sites in mind, not just
in East Anglia as mentioned in the Official Journal, and that it needed
price quotes from equipment companies in order to carry out its
economic assessments.

Amoco's invitation to tender follows a series placed by Enron Europe in
December 1995, for various CCGT components for an unspecified site in
the north west of England. The supply contracts includes a 240MW gas
turbine, high pressure steam boilers and one or more back-pressure 75MW
steam turbines and one or more heat recovery steam generators.

Enron would not comment on the site for the plant, but did confirm that
the CCGT in question would be suitable for a combined heat and power
application.

The rating of the plant and the northwest site suggest that Enron is
bidding to provide CHP facilities at Brunner Mond or at ICI Runcorn.

CCGT GENERATION GROWTH SLOWS IN 1995

Current industry estimates are that total CCGT generation in England
and Wales in 1995 reached just over 45TWh. This compares with
projections of over 50TWh made at the beginning of the year. CCGT
generation in 1994 was 36TWh, indicating a 25% increase in 1995.

The lower than expected growth in generation is largely due to the
delayed commissioning of several major new CCGT plants - (most notably,
Little Barford (National Power), Keadby (Hydro-Electric/Norweb) and
Medway (AES, Seeboard and Southern).

Keadby has just this week completed handover (from John Brown
Engineering, the construction contractor). Handover had been originally
scheduled for last summer, but vibration problems meant that the
commissioning programme was disrupted. It is the same story at the
other two stations. Medway now reports, as do the others, that its two
turbines are running fine. However, it does not now expect to complete
handover until late summer, almost a year behind the original scheduled
date. None of the companies would comment on who has borne the burden
of the delay costs, but industry rumours suggest that GE has covered a
substantial portion.

With these three plants now running and with PowerGen's 1,400MW
Connah's Quay expected on in the summer, and a full year's output from
Barking, CCGT generation should exceed 70TWh in 1996.

WELLHEAD GAS GENERATOR SET TO TRADE BELOW GSP

Independent Energy UK, a small West Midlands-based energy company is
set to begin operations at its first on-shore wellhead gas power plant
that will export power onto the local distribution network. The first
plant, due on in April will only be rated at 1MW, but IEUK's commercial
director John Sully, says that the company has licences for several on-
shore sites. He expects to have 30-60MW of generation capacity across
the Midlands within a year.

IEUK has been born from a merger of Ipsco, an oil industry servicing
company, and EUKAN, a small gas company with several on-shore gas
concessions. By diversifying into generation, Sully, who recently
joined from Scottish Power's energy trading arm, says the company is
able to exploit the added value of moving downstream. Sully adds that
the vertical integration does not need to stop at generation and that
IEUK intends to be an active trader in electricity and gas. The company
is also likely to apply for a second-tier supply licence.

COAL GENS TO FACE ONE RAIL COMPANY

The success of Wisconsin Central Transportation in winning all three of
the rail-freight concerns means that the English coal generators will
again face a single railway carrier. Coal industry sources fear that
the generators and coal suppliers will see their bargaining position
weakened, so railage costs could increase which would feed through to
higher fuel costs. National Power is best placed among the generators
as it already has acquired several train sets and has options with
suppliers which would cover its full coal needs.

NEW YEAR SEES PRICE TUMBLE

The run up to Christmas saw a step gear change in the generators bids
which as seen PPP (Pool Purchase Prices) over the last four weeks of
slightly over 2p/kWh, versus an average level from mid November to mid
December of over 6p/kWh. The capacity component of prices has in the
last three weeks (business days) has been just 0.3p/kWh, an order of
magnitude less than the level seen prior to the pre-Christmas tumble.
SMP (system marginal prices) have also come down) to around 2.2p/kWh
versus 3.25p/kWh.

The fall in prices to some extent reflects an increase in available
capacity, especially this month as Nuclear Electric has brought all bar
two of it reactors back on line. As last year, however, the major part
of the reduction reflects a marked change in genco bidding, as the
companies endeavour to make a effort to stop both the time and demand
weighted price caps being broken by a large margin.

Financial year to date prices (PPPs) are still below the cap. As of
January 18, the demand-weighted average is 2.65p/kWh versus a cap of
2.694p/kWh. The time-weighted average is 2.34p/kWh, compared with
2.535p/kWh.

On present trend the time-weighted cap is likely to be under shot by a
significant margin, while it is touch and go as to whether the demand-
weighted cap will be exceeded. The sense of deja vu is obvious, but
this time the generators know the extent to which they can attribute
the failure to meet the cap to "unpredictable events". Some observers
have suggested that this year the generators will be less concerned to
err on the side of caution.

MCILDOON CALLS FOR COMPETITION

Douglas McIldoon, the Northern Ireland Regulator, has reaffirmed NI
Offer's desire to see greater competition in the Province's generation
and wholesale supply businesses*.

In a report, his first since taking office in November last year,
McIldoon reviews the predicament that NI faces in terms of the vesting
structure - particularly the long-term must-take generation contracts.
McIldoon says that even "if NI can avoid to pay for new capacity during
the next seven years, and particularly if the adverse effect of the
Ballylumford gas contract can be minimised, the prospects are for
prices being broadly stable - subject to coal, oil and gas prices not
moving dramatically upwards." But as energy prices are already above
those in the rest of the UK, prices need to be cut, if the Province is
not to miss the opportunities provided by the development of a more
peaceful society.

McIldoon has proposed a number of possible steps that might be taken to
extend competition, which he says are in line with the draft European
Directive on liberalisation of the electricity market and the
government's tenet that customers should pay the full cost of the
energy they consume.

* Ending of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE)'s power procurement
monopoly. This requirement has already been relaxed for self-generation
projects, but it is possible that once the termination dates for genset
contracts are reached the generators could be freed to sell to
suppliers and customers of their  choice. This could lead to a gradual
expansion of independently contracted generation from as early as this
year if Offer exercises its termination rights on the generation
contracts. However, the earliest termination dates for the bigger
stations, Kilroot and Ballylumford, are not until 2010 (Power UK
10/17). On this basis Belfast West (240MW) could be brought fully into
the independent sector by 2000, with Coolkeeragh joining in 2004. New
independent generators and self-generators would also be allowed to
trade direct to customers and suppliers of their choice.

In order that this could work effectively it would be a logical step to
allow independent generators access to the grid. However, in order that
there was not an excessive build of capacity that could leave NIE with
considerable stranded capacity, the Regulator has suggested that there
might need to be  limits on independent generation. This could be on
the basis of MW ratings of independent and self-generation sites or
restrictions to CHP or renewable generators.

* Allowing independent power lines. There may be scope for allowing
independent generators to construct direct power links to dedicated
customers, but this would have to be weighed against the environmental
impact of such links.

* Liberal interconnector trading. The North-South interconnector could
also be available both for certain customers in NI to buy directly from
the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) or for NI generators to sell
directly to ESB's power procurement business.

* Stimulating the market for energy efficiency. This would include
measures to improve availability and accessibility of energy efficient
appliances, information and awareness campaigns, and soft financing
packages for energy efficiency schemes.

* Renewable energy. New arrangements could be implemented to create a
market for renewable energy. This would take the initial cost of
securing further capacity out of the general tariffs.

* CHP. It is important to ensure that CHP competes on equal terms with
electricity only plant. Removing some current distortions could lead to
new CHP schemes being developed. The Regulator says a paper on this
will be published later.

* Supply competition. While there is no protected franchise in NI,
second-tier suppliers have made no impression in the market place. This
almost certainly reflects the dominant position of NIE as the sole
power procurement body. Once that goes supply competition may blossom.

McIldoon concedes that there is no head to head competition in
generation at present and that the existence of the long-term contracts
ties the Regulator's hand on what can be proposed. He has indicated
that he will want to discuss with the generators and NIE the
possibility of revisiting the vesting contracts. However, the chases of
unscrambling the vesting stitch are must be slim as the generators hold
all the aces.

DTI CLEARS CSW BID FOR SEEBOARD

The DTI has decided not to refer Central and South West (CSW)'s #1.6bn
bid for SEEBOARD to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This is the
first bid to be approved since trade secretary Ian Lang referred the
bids of National Power and PowerGen to the MMC in November. Lang said
that CSW had given assurances that it would provide the regulator with
all the information he required and that the REC would retain its
financial independence.

CSW's bid is the fifth REC takeover to be cleared. The five approved
bids also include Southern Electric International's for SWEB, Hanson's
for Eastern Group, Scottish Power's for Manweb and North West Water's
for Norweb.

Ian Lang, industry minister, has also decided not to refer the proposed
acquisition of South Wales Electricity (SWALEC) by Welsh Water plc to
the Monopolies & Merger Commission. In making this decision, Lang took
the advice of Offer, the Office of Fair Trading and Ofwat (the water
industry regulator), all of which saw no case for referral on
competition grounds.

Welsh Water has given the DTI assurances that if the proposed
acquisition of SWALEC is successful it will agree to licence
amendments, on financial ring fencing, provision of adequate financial
and management resources and regulatory access to information.

Offer has set a tougher target for improvements in the quality of
supply provided by Hydro-Electric over the next five years. The target
for 1999/2000 is for 105 customer minutes for lost supply, arising from
faults in the company's HV distribution network. This represents a 16%
improvement on the 10-year average figure of 125 minutes. The tougher
targets were recommended by the Monopolies & Mergers Commission
published in June last year.

UNDERGROUND STARTS TENDER PROCESS

London Underground Limited (LUL) has formally started the tender
process for a 30-year supply contract to cover its power needs, by
posting notice of the contract in the European Union's Official
Journal.

LUL says the contract would be expected to cover the
refurbishment,operation and maintenance of the company's distribution
network and the provision of DC and AC supplies (either imported or
generated). Presently, total annual electricity consumption amounts to
900GWh. (PUK 17/3).

The company says that a decision to award a contract, which will be
performance-based, is expected to be made by the end of 1996. The
decision will depend on there being a sound business case for
contracting out. A short-list of companies is expected to be drawn up
by end March. The contract is being pursued under the UK government's
Public Finance Initiative.

NATPOWER TO CUT #60M FROM COSTS

National Power has announced that it intends to cut it's annual
operating costs by around #60m following a major review of its non
power station activities. The cost savings are expected to be phased
in, #40m in 1996/97 and #60m in 1997/98, both compared with current
costs. As part of the cost cutting, the company expects to shed around
400 jobs in non power station areas. Most of the job losses will be at
the company's Swindon offices, where around 1,400 staff are employed.

NP says that its renewed cost drive is a response to increasing
competition in the generation and supply businesses, and the expected
reduction in the company's generating capacity following disposal of
4GW of coal fired plant.

* NP's director of fuel management, Keith McNair is leaving the
company. He is returning to the US where he will join CSX. One of the

BE PRIVATISABLE ONLY AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE SAY MACKERRON AND SADNICKI

On the basis of a detailed station-by-station analysis a new study by
Gordon MacKerron and Mike Sadnicki concludes that the privatisation of
British Energy is unlikely to achieve anywhere near the government's
target of #2.6bn. MacKerron and Sadnicki (M&S)'s results show that
taking a prudent investor's view and applying conventional nuclear
industry discounting practice (whereby liabilities are discounted at a
low (2%) rate), yields a net present value (NPV) of minus #2.6bn. If
the operational discount rate is applied to liabilities that will be
discharged over the operating life of stations, then the NPV is raised
to just over #0.8bn.

The authors argue that investors are likely to take the latter
approach, as there is little commercial reason to treat cash outflows
to meet operational expenses any differently from cash spent on
discharging liabilities. On this basis, investors will see a positive
value for BE.

But M&S point out that this valuation adopts the nuclear industry's
estimates of liabilities and that there are reasons to believe these
could be substantial under-estimates. They claim this is the case with
AGR waste liabilities, where the industry estimates are #0.7bn (#0.3bn
discounted) compared with their own estimate of #6.6bn (#3.6bn
discounted) (- see below). If investors believe waste liabilities are
nearer the M&S estimates than the industry's own estimates this would
of course take the NPV well into negative values. And there are other
potential downside risks, most notably on station performance and
electricity sales price.

Just how the government has come up with its #2.6bn valuation is
unclear as the DTI has provided no hints as to the cost and performance
assumptions nor the discounting approach. M&S suggest that there are
two ways in which such a high value can be achieved, using their cost
and performance assumptions.

* by applying a 6% discount rate to both operational and liability cash
streams, or;

* by unloading liabilities related to pre-1996 operations.

M&S point out that KPMG adopted a 6% discount rate when evaluating
liabilities management options in its report to the DTI as part of the
government's Nuclear Review in 1994. The 6% rate is the lowest public
sector test rate. But the authors argue that it is inappropriate to use
such a low rate, and the government itself advocates a 10% hurdle rate
where public sector concerns sells their output in a competitive market
place. M&S use a 13% discount rate. They argue this is consistent with
what National Power and others had advocated in nuclear review
submissions, and is also the outcome of applying a capital asset
pricing model.

Waste liabilities likely to top #6bn

M&S say that the nuclear industry's estimates of waste liabilities
could be out by an order of magnitude. This conclusion is based on an
analysis of the components of waste costs. According to the authors,
waste liabilities include:

* packaging, storage and disposal of low level waste (LLW);

* disposal at NIREX of intermediate level waste (ILW) produced by
Thorp;

* packaging, storage and disposal at NIREX of ILW produced at stations.

Using data on a US disposal site M&S estimate LLW costs to amount to
#376m.

M&S's assumptions on valuation

* AGR load factors will on average be lower than achieved in the
  last two years, at 69.6% (versus 75.8% and 71.6% in 1993/94 and
  1994/95), but will be higher than the average over the last six
  years, 64.7%.
* Sizewell B load factor will be 70%.
* Station life will be 30 years for Dungeness B, Heysham 1 and
  Hartlepool and 35 for the other four AGRs, while Sizewell B's life
  is 40 years.
* Present capacities will be maintained.
* Average sales price for electricity is 2.5p/kWh.
* Station fuel costs are 0.45p/kWh.
* Non-station operating and maintenance (ORM) costs will fall 5%/yr
  until 2000, and then remain fixed, while station ORM costs are
  assumed stable across the station life.
* Marginal reprocessing costs are estimated to be #598,000 a tonne
  of uranium.
* AGR decommissioning costs amount to #560m per station based on the
  industry's "reference strategy", rather than the "deferred
  safestore" option.
* Annual operating costs of Sizewell B are #90m.
* AGR waste liabilities are estimated to be #0.7bn undiscounted,
  based on estimates by the NUCG (Nuclear Utilities Chairmans'
  Group) and Fred Pallant.
* A 13% discount rate is applied to operational cash streams, while
  a two alternative rates are applied to liabilities (2% and 13%) to
  produce two base case valuations, which M&S call the conventional
  and innovative.

ILW disposal is costed on the basis of the fully built up costs of the
NIREX repository which is assumed to be available by 2011. Using a 6%
discount rate, capital cost of #1.88bn and an annual operating cost of
#15m M&S estimate a disposal cost of #28,000 a cubic metre. This figure
is a factor of three to four times higher than any industry estimate.
Applying this figure to the rate of waste generation, making allowance
for stockpiled waste and adding on waste packaging and transport costs
gives a total ILW disposal cost of #4.7bn.

Plutonium storage costs are estimated on the basis that little
plutonium will be used in making mixed oxide fuels. Taking the AGR
plutonium generation rates and applying US data on storage costs yields
a storage cost which averages almost #50m annually in the period up to
2030. M&S say that these costs are so high that they cut off their
calculation at 2030, on the assumption that the industry would find a
lower cost disposal route. Taking costs up to 2030 gave a total
undiscounted plutonium storage cost of #1.65bn.

Summing these costs together gives a total waste storage and disposal
cost of #6.737bn. When discounted the figure is reduced to #3.6bn.

The City will undoubtedly look closely at the M&S report, as it
provides by far the best bottom up analysis of costs. Not everyone will
agree with the approach adopted or the assumptions. Most analysts
concur with M&S that investors are likely to discount operational and
liability cash flows at the same rate at least over the life of
stations, but several point out that the NPV of the assets is only just
the beginning of the valuation process. They argue that until the
capital structure, tax rules and any government guarantees on risks are
known it is very difficult to put a value on BE. There is also the
issue of terminal value, which is particularly thorny issue for a
nuclear generator. Intuitively, many would say the terminal value must
be negative, due to the high back-end liabilities. Not so, says John
Reynolds, of James Capel, who argue the value could be significantly
positive, if BE is able to generate new assets. Reynolds also says that
the expected stable market share over the next decade gives BE an
advantage over the gencos, which could largely offset the nuclear risk
premium on the discount rate.

ELECTRIC RESTRUCTURING: ELCON Releases Its Blueprint For The Future

The Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON), a Washington,
D.C.-based trade association representing large industrial
customers, has released its "Blueprint for Customer Choice," which
it believes contains the economic and regulatory frameworks, as
well as legislative reforms needed for the emergence of real
competition in the electric industry.

ELCON advocates removal of federal and state impediments to market
entry by any entity that seeks to provide or purchase products or
services presently offered as a bundled service by utilities. ELCON
believes that only a minimum of physical assets and services need
be regulated to ensure the reliable operation of the grid. It wants
all market segments to be unbundled. But while generation service
should not be regulated, the rates, terms, and conditions for use
of transmission and distribution facilities that continue to be
provided as monopoly services should be regulated.

Existing contractual relationships between native load customers
and their utilities, and between utilities and their suppliers,
should be honored. But ELCON advocates that utilities mitigate
stranded costs by writing off or writing down those assets against
earnings, by the sale of those or other nongenerator assets, by
renegotiating purchased power or fuel supply contracts, and by cost
reductions. No utility should be allowed to seek recovery of any
costs associated with uneconomic assets that were incurred
subsequent to enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).
ELCON desires creation of an independent system operator, splitting
the traditional distribution functions between a "wires" business
and the electric services merchant business, and creation of a
federal-state joint board to recommend actions to state
legislatures.

Cynthia Mansfield, a General Public Utilities Vice President, and
a leader of the PURPA Reform Group, expressed dissatisfaction that
ELCON would deny utilities recovery of prudently incurred costs
associated with uneconomic assets committed to after passage of
EPAct, yet require utilities to continue buying PURPA power for the
indefinite future. Mansfield claimed that ELCON's proposal to
extend PURPA benefits to all producers and consumers who had
achieved PURPA qualifying status by the beginning of the transition
period, would increase stranded costs.

GAS TRANSPORTATION: Bay State Gas To Offer New Programs

The Massachusetts commission has approved a settlement authorizing
Bay State Gas Co. (BSG) to redesign its gas rates and launch a
residential unbundling pilot program, believed by BSG to be the
first of its kind offered in New England.

The pilot will allow participating residential customers to buy
natural gas transportation service from BSG, while choosing gas
suppliers. The program will be conducted in three phases of
development, pilot implementation (by heating season of 1996), and
program assessment.

The settlement will enable BSG to introduce new rates that more
closely reflect the actual costs associated with serving different
customer classes. New rates became effective January 1, 1996.

Other components of the utility's rate redesign will be aimed at
making transportation service from BSG more attractive to a larger
group of commercial and industrial customers. (Presently only 100
of BSG's largest customers buy unbundled transportation service).
Specifically, BSG will offer supplemental gas supply service during
the winter period to meet seasonal demand. Also, it will offer
`needle peaking' service to help commercial and industrial
customers guard against supply shortfalls during the coldest days
when marketers may be unable to guarantee deliveries.

CREDIT RATINGS: Moody's: Northeastern Utilities Are Under Pressure

Moody's Investors Service has released a report, "Northeast Break-
Even Analysis," which foundsthat while wide variations exist in the
cost structures of investor-owned, municipal, and state electric
utilities in the Northeastern United States, that in a deregulated,
price competitive market for electricity, a solid majority of the
utilities would be at a significant disadvantage in relation to
their peers in contiguous regions. If full competition is
introduced, Moody's concluded that Northeastern utilities with
above average costs likely would experience deterioration in credit
quality as some investments are unrecoverable from ratepayers.

Moody's defines the Northeast competitive arena as all major rated
utilities within two transmission interconnects of Consolidated
Edison Co. of New York. It includes 25 IOUs in nine states, as well
as two public power and two Canadian utilities. They represent over
$153 billion in combined assets, $29.7 billion in combined equity,
and over $48 billion in annual revenues.

Moody's said that most of the utilities have the highest "break-
even" prices in the nation. (Moody's defines break-even as the
price a utility must charge for each unit of capacity to cover its
fixed charges after applying all profits or margins from its energy
sales. Because Moody's generating cost model is a residual
analysis, differences in relative cost position are magnified,
which allows for meaningful comparisons among utilities).

Moody's estimated $43 billion in stranded costs in this region
alone, which accounts for about one quarter of all U.S. stranded
costs.

Regulatory initiatives remain at the information gathering stage,
with principles for guiding an orderly transition to competition in
place in New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island (see Weekly No.
3234). They are in the process of being developed or endorsed in
New Hampshire, New Jersey, Vermont and Maine (see weekly Nos. 3228,
3230, 3234). Moody's noted that Pennsylvania is leaning toward a
"wait and see" approach, with a recent PUC staff recommendation
suggesting that it is not yet time for extreme change.

Based on average price assumptions, Moody's found that only Hydro-
Quebec would be able to cover all fixed costs and earn a profit
through energy sales alone. Hydro-Quebec and the New York Power
Authority fell at the low end of the scale, with negative break-
even prices, reflecting much hydrogeneration. At the high end of
the price scale are United Illuminating, Long Island Lighting Co.,
and Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co-op. Moody's said
it expects downgrades to continue for utilities in the Northeast,
especially due to negative transition cost decisions and definitive
moves toward open access.

ELECTRIC RATES: S.Carolina E&G Pleased With Ruling

The South Carolina PSC has approved a $67.5 million (7.34%) retail
electric rate hike for South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. (SCEG), to
be phased-in over a two-year period. SCEG had requested a $76.7
million (8.35%) increase.

The approved rates are based on a 12% return on common equity,
resulting in an overall return on rate base on 9.59%. The Phase 1
increase of about $59.5 million (6.47%), will become effective upon
completion and commercial operation of SCEG's new, 385-Mw, coal-
fired Cope generating plant, expected January 15, 1996. The total
capital cost of the plant is expected to be about $436 million
(including AFDC), which is under the original budget of $537
million. About one-half of the plant's total capital cost already
is included in base rates due to a June, 1993 order. The PSC now
approved recovery of remaining capital costs and annual operating
expenses associated with Cope.

Also included in Phase 1 is a $4.3 million increase for a storm
damage reserve account, that will be capped at $50 million and
collected through rates over a ten-year period.

The PSC granted SCEG's request to accelerate recovery of almost all
its regulatory assets, and to shift about $257 million of
depreciation reserves from its transmission and distribution assets
to nuclear production assets. The latter change will enhance its
competitive position by reducing the cost of its nuclear
generation.

INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS: Moody's Finds U.K. Deal Manageable

Moody's Investors Service has lowered the commercial paper rating
for Central and South West Corp. (CSW) from `P-1' to 'P-2' in
response to significantly greater leverage assumed by CSW to
acquire SEEBOARD, a regional electric distribution company located
in Great Britain.

The CSW bid valued SEEBOARD at $2.5 billion, and Moody's said it
finds the additional debt manageable given the good competitive
position of CSW's U.S. utilities, and the generally stable business
outlook for SEEBOARD. But Moody's expects the increased leverage to
put some strain on CSW's cash flow, reducing overall financial
flexibility.

CSW plans to fund the acquisition 60% through nonrecourse bank
debts raised in the U.K., and 40% through an equity contribution
from the U.S. parent corporation. It has negotiated an $850 million
unsecured bank facility to raise funds for the equity contribution.

ELECTRIC FUTURES: NYMEX Looks Forward To Approval

The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) expects approval of its
two West coast electric futures contracts by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) this month, and anticipates launching
them before the second half of 1996.

The futures, the first ever for electricity, have the same delivery
terms but one has a delivery point at the California-Oregon border,
while the other is at Palo Verde, Arizona.

Meanwhile, the two proposed electric options contracts, which are
based on the futures contracts, are expected to receive CFTC
approval later in 1996.

DISCOUNT RATES: Vermont Customers to Get Break

Green Mountain Power Corp. (GMP) has asked the Vermont commission
to approve a one-year pilot electric discount program, which would
be available to residential and small business customers who use
more electricity in 1996 than they did in 1995.

The program is aimed at GMP's smaller customers and would provide
a 25% discount on electricity use that exceeds the amount a
customer used during the previous year. The discount would be
limited to 15% of additional electricity use, and customers would
not have to sign up for the program but instead would automatically
qualify.

"Qualifying customers can take advantage of the discount without
increasing the cost to other customers, said GMP President and CEO
Douglas G. Hyde. "That is because there is a surplus of electricity
in new England, and we are giving out customers an opportunity to
take advantage of this unusual energy situation," Hyde added.

NATURAL GAS PIPELINES: Nixed Sale Leads To New Deal

Tenneco Energy (TE) has agreed to sell its 50% interest in the Kern
River natural gas pipeline system to the Williams Companies, Inc.
for $205 million. The companies are joint venture partners in the
Wyoming to California pipeline.

The plan came about after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled
at the end of December that the sale by TE of its 50% interest to
Questar Pipeline could result in market power by Questar in the
Salt Lake City area (see Weekly No. 3235). But the new sale plan
still requires FTC approval.

"Based on discussions with our partner, Williams over the past few
days, we concluded it was in Tenneco's best interest to avoid the
time and expense involved in restarting the bidding process, and go
ahead and finalize the terms of the transaction before year end,"
said Steve Chesebro', TE Chairman and CEO.

LEAST-COST PLANNING: Oregon PUC Finds Idaho Power Reasonable

The Oregon PUC on December 29 acknowledged Idaho Power Co.'s (IP)
least-cost plan, which implements new conservation programs and
system efficiency improvements, continues efforts to relicense its
hydroelectric plants, and continues solar and windpower
development.

PUC acknowledgement of a least-cost plan means that the plan seems
reasonable to the PUC at the time, but favorable ratemaking
treatment is not guaranteed. It gives considerable weight in the
ratemaking process to utility actions that are consistent with
acknowledged plans.

TELEPHONE COMPETITION: Colorado Works On Local Rules

The Colorado PUC is beginning hearings this month on proposed rules
to open the local telephone market to competition beginning July 1.
The proposed rules would implement state legislation passed last
year instructing the PUC to open up local service to competition.

For six months, various working groups have attempted to agree on
interconnection and number potability, resale, high cost funds, 911
services, and certification. Each group drafted a set of proposed
rules, and consensus was reached in the areas of 911 requirements
and certifications. More than one set of proposed rules were
drafted for the other areas, and the PUC need by law only give
substantial deference to those rules where consensus was reached.
The hearings run through March, with an initial decision expected
in early April, and a final decision by May 31.

ELECTRIC COMPETITION: Tribal Choice Causes Lawsuit

Madison Gas and Electric Co. (MGE) on January 3 filed a lawsuit in
court and a complaint at the Wisconsin PSC against Wisconsin Power
& Light Co. (WPL), because WPL will provide electricity to a Native
American tribe's bingo hall to be located in MGE territory (see
Weekly No. 3232).

WPL on December 1, 1995 had won the bid to provide service to the
tribe. Although present state law only allows provision of service
by a certificated utility in its own service territory, the tribe
has raised the argument that it is excluded from the law because it
is a sovereign nation.

In court, MGE has asked for treble actual damages -- lost margins
on electric sales made by WPL. MGE also asked for punitive damages
and award of attorneys' fees. At the PSC, MGE asked it to require
WPL to remove any electric lines and related plant from  MGE's
service territory.

INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATORS: FERC To Hold Technical Conference

The FERC on January 4 announced that as part of its electric
transmission open access NOPR, it would hold a technical conference
on independent system operators (ISO) and reform of power pools
under the federal power act. The conference will be held January 24
at 9:30 A.M. at the FERC.

The FERC said that at its December 5 and 6, 1995 conference on
comparability for power pools, that several speakers had described
proposals for developing ISOs as one method to address full
competition. It wants to (1) define the essential elements and
operational characteristics of an ISO; (2) explore principles to be
used in reforming power pools; and (3) explore utility formation of
ISOs.

Electricity -- Flexible Rates

The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities has approved a new
"market-based" electric tariff for Fitchburg Gas & Electric Co., a
combined electric and gas utility. The new Energy Bank Service
offers rates for new or expanding industrial customers that are
priced competitively with average industrial rates in the United
States.  While the utility had supported the new rate offering as
consistent with the state's restructuring goals of greater customer
choice and access to wholesale market prices, the department
rejected the utility's position that the new discount customers
should be exempted from any specific stranded cost charges in the
future.

According to the company, it currently has no excess capacity and
intends to meet the power requirements for the new service offering
form wholesale markets through short-term contracts of one month or
less.  The department said that utility's proposal deserved
stricter scrutiny than other discount proposals recently approved
for utilities who had extra power to sell. Nevertheless, it found
that revenues would more than offset incremental power costs and
separate fuel procurement and accounting procedures devised by the
utility would allow the department to determine whether the new
service offering affected costs for other ratepayer groups. The
department also directed the company to include in the new tariff
a statement that the structure and design of the new rate might
change as a result of the implementation of a restructuring plan
for the utility. Re Fitchburg Gas and Electric Co., D.P.U. 95-75,
Nov. 30, 1995 (Mass.D.P.U.).

The Missouri Public Service Commission has turned down a request by
Kansas City Power and Light Co., an electric utility, for approval
of a generic tariff for special contract offerings to its large
industrial customers. The proposed service would have allowed the
utility to "flex down" from rates in its established Primary Large
Service tariff in order to meet a competitive threat. The utility
had proposed to limit availability of the discount service to
customers with demands of 1,000 kW or greater who are faced with
competition from other energy suppliers. It would have provided the
service at a rate not less than the greater of 1.3 cents per kwh on
an annual average basis or its annualized incremental cost per kwh.
The commission rejected allegations that special rate contracts
were unlawful and also ruled that the protection of confidential
business information associated with the contracts was within its
authority, but it concluded that a generic tariff for discounts
should be considered as part of an investigation of the utility's
overall rate design. Nevertheless, the commission found that the
type of competition currently facing the utility could require a
"bundled service" offering of the type suggested by the utility. It
also said that an unbundled service offering with a price ceiling
and price floor for each service component might also be necessary
in "preparation for the full range of competition" in the utility's
service territory. Re Kansas City Power and Light Co., Case No. EO-
95-181, Dec. 6, 1995 (Mo.P.S.C.).

Electric Industry Restructuring

The Maine Public Utilities Commission has launched a formal inquiry
into the restructuring of the electric industry in the state. The
state legislature had allotted the commission a one-year period,
beginning on January 1, 1996, to develop at least two plans for the
transition to a competitive retail electric market including: (1)
a plan to achieve full retail market competition by the year 2000
and (2) a plan to achieve retail competition "wherever effective
competition is likely" while maintaining regulation where
necessary. Under the legislative mandate the commission is required
to provide a range of estimates of stranded investment associated
with each restructuring proposal.  the commission seeks comments on
a variety of issues including whether rate decreases can be
expected  and whether retail competition would provide benefits to
consumers that cannot be obtained through enhanced wholesale
competition.  Re Electric Utility Industry Restructuring, Docket
No. 95-462, Dec. 12, 1995 (Me. P.U.C.).

Mergers -- Rate Increases

The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission has turned
back a pre-merger attempt by Puget Sound Power and Light Co. to
make permanent a $165.5 million rate increase allowed under its
periodic rate adjustment mechanism (PRAM), a ratemaking clause
designed to remove disincentives to utility conservation efforts by
"decoupling" revenues from sales levels and instead relying on a
revenue per customer approach to cost recovery. The utility had
earlier agreed to defer a scheduled base rate filing pending review
by the commission of its proposed merger with Washington Energy Co.
The commission said that it had approved the deferral subject to
the utility's agreement to file a rate case by April of 1996 if no
merger application was filed, but that any extension of the PRAM
collections beyond their scheduled expiration on October 1, 1996
would be treated a temporary rates subject to refund. It added that
the utility could choose to file a base rate case at any time
seeking permanent recovery of the PRAM collections. Washington

Light Co., Docket Nos. UE-901183-T et al., Nov. 7, 1995

LECs -- Competition -- Interconnection tariffs

The New York Public Service Commission has ordered New York
Telephone Co., a telecommunications local exchange carrier (LEC),
notify customers of the newly instituted opportunity to choose an
alternative carrier for intraLATA toll calling. Interexchange
carriers in the state had complained about the LEC's plans for
implementation of a recent order by the commission reqiring equal
access for intraLATA toll services. (Prior to the "intraLATA
presubscription" ruling, customers who desired their "local" toll
calls to be carried by an interexchange carrier such as AT&T, MCI,
or Sprint were required to dial special code numbers in addition to
the telephone number.)  The LEC had proposed that in negotiating
new services with customers its representatives would not inform
customers of the rule change or ask customers who they want as
their intraLATA toll carrier. It claimed that to do so would place
it at a competitive disadvantage and increase the cost of
processing new service orders. The commission disagreed with the
carrier finding that while the claims may have some merit, the LEC
had ignored the advantages it possessed in controlling the
telephone order processing function and from beginning the equal
access process with 100% of the presubscribed market. For a
competitive market to develop customers must be informed of
available choices, the commission said. It also noted that without
specific instructions from regulators "irresistible incentives"
would develop to sell the LEC's service unfairly. Re New York
Telephone Co., Case Nos. 28425 et al., Dec. 1, 1995 (N.Y.P.S.C.)

Trimble County Generating Plant -- Rate Disallowance

The Kentucky Public Service Commission has approved an agreement
finally concluding a long standing case governing rate treatment of
the investment by Louisville Gas & Electric in the Trimble county
generating facility. The matter had been before the commission in
one form or another for well over a decade.  In 1989 the commission
determined that 25% of the 495 megawatt coal-fired plant was
disallowed from rate base. Under the approved agreement the utility
will refund current customers $22 million with $5.3 million
reserved to special contract customers and the rest refunded to all
other customers through a per-kwh credit over a five year period.
The utility also agreed to apply an additional $4.5 million to fund
low-income energy assistance programs over the same five-year
period. Commissioner Linda K. Breathitt expressed concern in a
separate concurring opinion over the length of time necessary for
residential customers to receive their refunds while certain
industrial customers would receive immediate payments. She also
noted that the agreement was an example of a recent trends in
settlement agreements presented to the commission where the
utility, its large industrial customers, and low income customers
are the obvious beneficiaries of ardent representation at the
bargaining table while the vast majority of customers appear to
have a much smaller voice in the process. Re Louisville Gas and
Electric Co., Case No. 10320, Dec. 8, 1995 (Ky.P.S.C.).

BIG RIVERS AND PACIFICORP ARE EXPECTED TO SIGN THEIR DEAL BY END OF
JANUARY

By the end of January, Big Rivers Electric Corp. and PacifiCorp hope to
announce a ``letter of intent'' under which PacifiCorp would lease and
manage Big Rivers' coal-fired power plants in western Kentucky over the
next quarter century.
   ``We're working on it diligently right nowhopefully we'll see something
in the next two to three weeks,'' a PacifiCorp spokesman told Southeast
Power Report on Jan. 8. A spokeswoman for financially troubled Big Rivers,
based in Henderson, Ky., echoed that sentiment.
   Meanwhile, Big Rivers' two largest customers--Alcan Aluminum and
Southwire/NSA--were trying to insert themselves in the process to guarantee
that their desire for lower, more stable electric rates is addressed.
Together, aluminum smelters operated by Alcan and Southwire/NSA at Sebree
and Hawesville, Ky., respectively, consume nearly 70% of the electricity
generated by Big Rivers.
   The late December announcement that Big Rivers was negotiating with
PacifiCorp on a 25-year lease/operation agreement ended months of
speculation over which of several suitors would meet with Big Rivers'
approval.
   Even with the ongoing Big Rivers/PacifiCorp talks, however, several
suitors have not given up all hope. At least three--U.S. Generating, an
independent power producer, Cinergy Corp. and Louisville Gas &
Electric--reportedly believe they still have a chance if the PacifiCorp
discussions collapse.
   While neither Big Rivers nor PacifiCorp, an aggressive Portland,
Ore.-based investor-owned utility, apparently believes that will happen,
the Big Rivers spokeswoman stressed, ``We're not going to close any doors.
It wouldn't be wise considering the investment we've made in this process
so far.''
   Big Rivers has been trying to find a solution to its $1.2-billion debt,
much of which is owed to the Rural Utilities Service for construction of
the 440-MW D.B. Wilson coal-fired plant in the early 1980s. Some of the
offers submitted to Big Rivers were to buy the generation and transmission
cooperative and/or its generating assets.
   PacifiCorp's, however, was different. The Oregon utility would create a
subsidiary that would lease and operate Big Rivers' three plants: 480-MW
Green, 455-MW Coleman and Wilson, in addition to the 315-MW Station Two
plant that Big Rivers operates under a long-term contract with the owner,
the city of Henderson.
   The subsidiary would sell power to Big Rivers, which would resell it to
its four distribution cooperatives, Henderson-Union Electric Cooperative,
Jackson Purchase Rural Electric Cooperative, Meade County Rural Electric
Cooperative and Green River Electric.
   Perhaps as importantly, if not more so, the PacifiCorp subsidiary also
would handle Big Rivers' coal-buying activities and sell surplus
electricity from the power plants to other utilities in the eastern U.S.
   Big Rivers' past coal-buying practices have been the subject of state
and federal investigations. They have resulted so far in the conviction of
three individuals on bribery/kickback charges involving former Big Rivers
general manager William Thorpe. Thorpe, who has denied any wrongdoing, is
expected to stand trial next summer on related charges.
   Most observers believe PacifiCorp, the largest wholesaler of bulk power
in the western U.S., would be more successful than Big Rivers has been in
marketing surplus power.
   ``We have said we want to take our core skills in that area and use it
in markets outside the West,'' said the PacifiCorp spokesman. ``We want to
do that in Kentucky.''

ENRON POWER MARKETING, OGLETHORPE IN 4-MONTH SALES, PURCHASE DEAL

Oglethorpe Power Corp. announced Jan. 5 that it began a major four-month
energy sales-and-purchase deal with Enron Power Marketing Inc. Under the
arrangement, Enron will have the first option to buy energy from
Oglethorpe's 5,000-MW system, while covering energy requirements of
Oglethorpe's 39 member cooperatives through April 30 (SPR, 29 Dec. 95, 1).
   Oglethorpe customers can expect to save ``several millions of dollars''
as a result of the arrangement because Enron will meet their needs at a
price lower than the current Oglethorpe energy charge. Enron expects to
make a profit on sales of energy which some Oglethorpe members cannot use.
   The two sides have not released details of the deal. However, Oglethorpe
officials acknowledged that a major selling point of the arrangement was
Enron's first option to all energy available from Oglethorpe plant
entitlements and contracts. Oglethorpe estimates that Enron will buy more
than 5.2-million MWh of energy over the four months.
   Oglethorpe resources include 1,185 MW of must-run nuclear capacity and
1,500 MW of dispatchable baseload fossil capacity in Georgia at Wansley
Units 1 and 2 and Scherer Units 1 and 2. It also has 636 MW of dispatchable
pumped hydro capacity at the new Rocky Mountain plant and contracts for
baseload and peaking power with Georgia Power and a 300-MW independent
power project at Hartwell, owned jointly by American National Power and
Destec.
   Under the arrangement, Enron essentially will take over the marketing in
the region of Oglethorpe's excess, bearing the risks of a flat market as
well as the potential gains from a strong market. Its strategy proved
profitable in the early part of January when the Southeast was hit with
several days of subfreezing weather.
   Oglethorpe will continue to operate its system and control area and
carry out dispatching. But Enron will also be present in the Oglethorpe
control center and will have a say in decisions affecting energy based on
provisions in the contract.
   Oglethorpe officials said the Enron contract contains no provisions for
a follow-up deal after April 30.
    But the company sees the arrangement as one possible model for future
operations. A second alternative would be an energy pool operated by
Oglethorpe itself, which was proposed in late 1995 and is now in
preparation.
   Officials at Cooperative Power Inc., made up of six large Oglethorpe
members, said they are still on track to contract with a marketer
themselves to handle their power trading and procurement after April 30.
   Because of the Enron arrangement and other developments at Ogelthorpe,
including December's restructuring announcement, Georgia Power is delaying
a request for proposals for power purchases in 2000. The RFPs had been
scheduled to go out in early January.
   Georgia Power had told the state Public Service Commission in October
that it planned to seek bids for up to 600 MW of peaking and intermediate
supplies using both traditional and options contracts.
   But since the company currently has contracts to sell 750 MW of power to
Oglethorpe, which could be canceled over the next three years, it has
decided to review its future needs because of the Oglethorpe
restructuring.
   Oglethorpe itself is still holding in suspension a 1993 RFP for 600 MW
of 1999 peaking power while it works out its future plans and power needs
under the restructuring.

COLDEST WEATHER IN SIX YEARS CAUSES RECORD PEAKS THROUGHOUT FLORIDA

While snow blanketed much of the East Coast of the U.S., Florida felt the
coldest weather in more than six years, as high demand set new winter and
all-time peak records throughout the state.
   The state's three largest utilities all set new all-time record peaks,
as temperatures dropped nearly to 20F in much of the state on Jan. 9. The
primary source of heating in Florida is electric, which puts an additional
stress on the system. Still, state-wide reserve capacity was about 3,800 MW
on Jan. 9, according to Tom Hallam, staff engineer of the Florida Electric
Utility Coordinating Group.
   Tampa Electric, which is normally the chief supplier of purchase power,
hit a new all-time peak of 3,526 MW about 7:11 a.m. on Jan. 9. A spokesman
said TECO had no reserve capacity and had to crank up its rarely used
combustion turbine units in order to meet demand. TECO had expected a low
of about 31 degrees and a demand of about 3,400 MW, which would have
exceeded the previous all-time peak of 3,339 MW set on Feb. 9, 1995.
   Florida Power broke records on both Jan. 8, when it hit 8,086 MW, and
again on Jan. 9, when demand soared to about 8,500 MW, a spokesman said. To
meet demand, Florida Power exercised about 600 MW of residential load
control and cranked up all but one of its small combustion turbine units.
It did not resort to interrupting its large industrial and commercial
customers, which would have given it another 700 MW, a spokesman said.
   Florida Power & Light hit a new all-time demand record of about 17,300
MW on the morning of Jan. 9, which easily exceeded the previous record of
16,563 MW set on Feb. 9, 1995, a spokesman said. At the time, about 34,000
or 1% of its customers were out of service due to scattered distribution
problems. To meet demand, FP&L used about 300 MW of commercial load
control, but was not forced to use the 500 MW of residential load control
it had available.
   The Orlando Utilities Commission broke all-time peak records on both
Jan. 8, when demand reached 893 MW at about 7:30 am., and Jan. 9, when the
peak was 917 MW at about 7 a.m. OUC operates a power pool for itself, the
Florida Municipal Power Agency, the Lakeland Electric & Water Dept.,
Kissimmee Utility Authority and the city of St. Cloud. An OUC spokesman
said the pool set a record of 2,272 MW on Jan. 8, then broke that record on
Jan. 9 at 2,410 MW.
   In North Florida, the Jacksonville Electric Authority broke its previous
all-time peak of 2,247 MW, which was also set on Feb. 9, 1995, on Jan. 8,
when demand hit 2,339 MW. On Jan. 9, JEA came within 5 MW of breaking that
record, a spokesman said. Gulf Power set a new winter peak of 1,821 MW on
Jan. 8, beating its previous winter peak of 1,821 MW on Dec. 23, 1989.

REGIONAL STATE-BY-STATE SCORECARD OF ELECTRIC INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING

    Over the last three months, restructuring debates have heated up in
most parts of the country, with 30 states now reporting some sort of
activity. The California Public Utilities Commission came out with a major
compromise plan in late December, several New England states are asking
their utilities to file restructuring plans in the coming six months, and
regulators have issued initial restructuring guidelines in several
Midwestern states. Restructuring debates have even begun in a few Southern
states, even though lower power prices in the region kept activity at a
minimum. The following is a state-by-state survey of restructuring activity
in the Southeast. All dates are 1995 unless otherwise noted.

ARKANSAS
In early 1995, a bill was introduced in the state Legislature that would
allow large industrial users to switch retail suppliers under certain
conditions. But the bill was quickly withdrawn without a major debate.
State regulators say they expect to start a restructuring proceeding in
1996, but so far the Public Service Commission has issued no initial
notice.

FLORIDA
The state Legislature has created a special subcommittee to investigate
competition in the electric industry. The panel will gather information and
could make legislative proposals in 1996.

GEORGIA
The Public Service Commission said it will hold an investigation in 1996
on whether the state's current territorial franchise system needs to be
adapted to the more competitive electric industry environment. The current
system lets large users choose among supply options when adding new load
but gives no freedom of choice to smaller customers.
In December, a bill was introduced in the state Legislature that would
force utilities to provide retail wheeling services to all customers and
give customers wide rights to switch retail suppliers without penalty. The
bill contains no stranded investment provisions and is strongly opposed by
utilities.

LOUISIANA
A group of industrial users proposed in May that the city of New Orleans
consider an open-access approach, with several suppliers competing for
retail users using the existing New Orleans Public Service distribution
system. But the plan got a cold reception from the City Council, and
planned hearings on competition issues have been postponed indefinitely.

MARYLAND
The Public Service Commission is carrying out a proceeding on competition
(Case No. 8678). In comments filed in January, industrial users have
favored full retail competition, while utilities have backed some
deregulation of generation and limited retail competition tied to stranded
investment. The PSC final report issued Aug. 18 rejected the use of retail
wheeling, saying that the relatively low power rates in the state meant
Maryland did not need ``dramatic fixes'' at this time.

NORTH CAROLINA
In February, industrials asked the Utilities Commission to begin an
investigation into retail competition. After receiving generally negative
comments from utilities, the commission decided on July 21 not to implement
retail wheeling at this time (Doc. No. E-100, Sub. 77). It said wheeling
presented too many legal uncertainties and that it preferred to wait and
see what other states did. It asked parties to offer further comments on
the issue.
   In October, large industrials warned that the go-slow approach would put
the state at a competitive disadvantage and called on the commission to
sponsor a new round of public meetings on retail competition in early
1996.

OKLAHOMA
In June, the Legislature set up a 14-member task force to review all
aspects of the electric industry in the state. It is not clear how much the
group will deal with competition issues.

SOUTH CAROLINA
In July, the Public Service Commission turned down a request from
industrials to initiate a formal review of retail wheeling. Instead, the
PSC staff will carry out a low-key study of the issue.

TEXAS
A major bill passed by the Texas Legislature in late May ordered various
changes in the operation of the state's wholesale market. But due to a
political stand-off, the bill did not change the status quo on retail
wheeling issues. A proposal for a retail wheeling pilot was dropped from
the bill, as were various anti-retail wheeling provisions. Instead, the
Legislature asked state regulators to conduct studies on key issues. Since
then, industrials have begun to organize a wider coalition in support of
retail competition and hope to apply greater political pressure in the 1997
legislative session.
   The Texas Public Utility Commission in October opened a general
restructuring proceeding (Docket No. 15000) to make recommendations to the
Legislature by 1997 on competition and stranded investment issues. Parties
were asked to comment on specific unbundling and stranded cost concepts
floated by commission members.
   The PUC also is asking for comment by January 1996 on a separate
transmission rule. It would set up a regional postage stamp pricing system
for use of the state grid and also bring in an independent system operator
to manage the system.

VIRGINIA
In September, the Virginia State Corporation Commission announced it was
opening a formal review of electric industry competition and restructuring
issues. It said its staff would issue a report on March 31, 1996, making
policy recommendations. After a 60-day public comment period, the SCC will
make final decisions.
  In its notice, the commission said its staff had already held informal
talks with key parties and that even though Virginia already had low
electric prices, there could be improvement through increased competition.
In comments submitted to the SCC in December, Virginia Power urged a
go-slow approach to retail competition and said the commission should
concentrate first on alternative ratemaking for utilities.

AEP DROPS NAMES OF OPERATING UNITS; ALL CALLED AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER

After decades of operation, Kentucky Power, Appalachian Power, Wheeling
Power and Kingsport Power are no more. In early January, the four utilities
adopted the name of their parent company, American Electric Power.
   The change--AEP's three other subsidiaries outside the Southeast were
affected as well--is part of AEP's ``New Directions Next Steps'' program to
prepare for competition and deregulation in the utility industry by trading
on its ``brand name'' recognition. AEP's other units are Columbus Southern
Power, Indiana Michigan Power and Ohio Power.
   All seven operating companies are now known as one company: American
Electric Power. From now on, the AEP logo will be emblazoned on company
facilities, vehicles and communications with customers. For the first time,
AEP's corporate headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, will bear a large ``AEP''
logo atop the building.
   Also this month, individual company publications are being consolidated
into one publication that will have a tabloid newspaper format.
   ``We've always been AEP, a world-class energy company dedicated to
hometown service, and our employees have worked under a variety of company
names in the past,'' said AEP chairman Linn Draper. ``Using AEP as our name
throughout the company is a sign that all of these individuals have joined
a single team to find ways to serve our customers even better.
   ``We do not need to change legal, financial, rate or regulatory
relationships as the result of the new one-company strategy,'' continued
Draper, ``but we expect our customers will see many benefits and
efficiencies from this change in days to come.''
   Not everyone within AEP was an enthusiastic supporter of the name change
last summer when Draper first disclosed plans to phase out operating
company identities. Over the years, fierce loyalties and friendly
competitions had developed within the seven subsidiaries.
   In the end, change won out as it is doing more frequently these days in
the utility industry.
   In keeping with its one-company philosophy, AEP has named new AEP
presidents as top statewide contacts for customer groups, legislators and
regulators. Effective Jan. 1, new state presidents include Timothy Moser,
Kentucky; Dana Waldo, West Virginia; and Daniel Carson, Virginia and
Tennessee.
   The state presidents will discuss what AEP believes are the benefits of
competition in the electric power industry with the company's customers,
regulators and legislators. They are expected to ``work diligently to build
a consensus on industry restructuring,'' Draper said.

VIRGINIA POWER TO CUT STAFF BY 30%; MAY PUT TWO 882-MW UNITS IN RESERVE

Virginia Power said Jan. 8 that its fossil and hydro business unit is in
the final stages of a far-reaching restructuring and downsizing effort
aimed at optimizing the cost-competitiveness of the utility's hydroelectric
facilities and plants fired by coal, oil and gas.
   Among other things, Virginia Power said, the fossil and hydro unit plans
to reduce by about 30% the number of salaried and hourly employees and to
``remission'' two large oil-fired plants from regular to emergency-only
use. These and other moves, it said, should save the utility $55 million to
$65 million a year and help maintain the utility's position as one of the
lowest-cost generators in its region.
   In a series of announcements over the past several months, the most
recent of which was Jan. 8, the fossil and hydro unit has said it will trim
its salaried and hourly payroll by a total of 537 positions by early March.
That will leave the unit with 1,254 employees.
   The utility said reductions are part of a ``comprehensive redesign
effort'' that grew out of the utility's Vision 2000 strategic planning
process.
   Last year, teams composed of fossil and hydro unit employees examined
potential efficiency and cost-cutting measures. In addition to recommending
the staffing reductions, the teams had urged that two 882-MW oil-fired
plants that have been providing intermediate and peaking capacity since the
mid-1970s--Possum Point Unit 5 and Yorktown Unit--should be placed in
emergency reserve, and be run four weeks each peak season.

SOUTH CAROLINA ALLOWS SCE&G TO SHIFT DEPRECIATION FROM T&D TO NUCLEAR
ASSETS

The South Carolina Public Service Commission has decided to allow South
Carolina Electric & Gas to transfer nearly $257 million in depreciation
reserves from its transmission and distribution assets to its nuclear
generation assets as part of a rate case (Docket No. 95-1000-E).
   The move has angered non-utility generators, industrials, and the
state's Dept. of Consumer Affairs, who claimed that the ruling will give
SCE&G--already one of the lowest-cost generators in the Southeast--an
unfair competitive advantage over other generators after deregulation, and
will increase the cost of accessing SCE&G's T&D system.
   The PSC also granted a 7.34%, $67.5-million rate hike for the utility.
   Nancy Vaughn Coombs, deputy consumer advocate at the state Dept. of
Consumer Affairs (DCA), explained that the depreciation-reserve shift will
result in a lower ``book value'' for SCE&G's two-thirds stake in the 900-MW
V.C. Summer nuclear plant, and a higher book value for the utility's T&D
assets.
   That, Coombs continued, will have the effect of shifting SCE&G's costs
away from its generation sector, which is likely to face increasing
competition as deregulation takes hold, to its T&D sector, which is likely
to remain a monopoly.
   In the increasingly competitive generation market, she said, other
generators and power marketers will be forced to compete with the
artificially lower generation costs SCE&G will be able to offer thanks to
the depreciation-reserve shift. Generators and marketers also will be
forced to pay artificially higher costs to wheel power across SCE&G lines
because those costs are based in part on the book value of its T&D assets.
   An irony in the matter, Coombs said, is that SCE&G already was unusually
well-positioned for generation competition even before it secured the PSC's
approval for the depreciation-reserve shift. ``Its rates are the lowest of
any investor-owned utility in South Carolina,'' she said, ``and are among
the lowest in the Southeast, which as a whole has the second-lowest rates
of any region in the country.''
   Coombs said the DCA will ask the PSC to reconsider its ruling, and added
that if the commission fails to do so, her agency is likely to file a legal
challenge in state court, asserting the depreciation reserve transfer
violates South Carolina law.
   The DCA's concerns were echoed by Craig Roach, a principal with Boston
Pacific Co. Inc. of Washington, D.C., who represents the Carolina
Competitive Energy Producers, a NUG group. ``The whole point of
unbundling,'' he said, ``is to reveal the true cost of generation,'' and
any effort to artificially lower the cost of generation is ``clearly
anti-competitive.''
   Roach added, however, that while he wishes the DCA well in its effort to
reverse the PSC's ruling, the group he represents cannot commit the
financial resources that would be involved in joining the fray. ``There are
too many battles to fight,'' he said.
   Also expressing concern about the depreciation-reserve shift was Arthur
Fusco, a Columbia, S.C., attorney who represents the South Carolina Energy
Users Committee (SCEUC), a 57-member industrial group that was been
pressing state regulators to accelerate deregulation and retail wheeling.
   Fusco said the depreciation reserve transfer would increase the wheeling
costs industrials would pay if, once retail competition arrives, they were
to buy their electricity requirements from a utility other than SCE&G.
   He said SCEUC also will urge the PSC to reconsider the magnitude of the
rate increase itself, which he said was ``way too high,'' in part because
the commission will allow SCE&G to earn a 12% rate of return on common
equity--a full percentage point higher than it had been earning.
   SCE&G general counsel Belton Ziegler defended the PSC's ruling, however,
and dismissed assertions that the transfer is anti-competitive. He said the
ruling will help his utility ``prepare for competition.''
   Among other things, Ziegler said the reserve shift is a necessary
preemptive step to ensure that any large retail customers that leave the
utility for other suppliers help pay for assets SCE&G had developed to
serve them. Without the shift, he said, residential and small-commercial
customers would likely end up paying for ``100%'' of the utility's stranded
investment, ``and we don't think that would be fair.''
   He continued, ``If you look at the natural gas industry, the benefits of
deregulation went for the most part to large customers who could move off
the system'' and avoid, as much as possible, the responsibility for paying
off the investments their old gas companies had made to serve them.
   ``We are telling industrials that if they leave as generation customers
they still will have to pay [for the nuclear assets SCE&G developed for
them] as transmission and distribution customers.''

`BLIZZARD OF '96', WHILE DUMPING MUCH SNOW, CAUSES RELATIVELY FEW OUTAGES

Given the magnitude of the snowstorm that swept through the northern tier
of the Southeast on Jan. 6 and 7, utilities in the region fared relatively
well, reporting customer outages that--taken together--ran only into the
tens of thousands.
   American Electric Power, which serves portions of Virginia and West
Virginia under what used to be called Appalachian Power Co. (see story on
its name changes this issue), said four of its smaller transmission lines
in the Virginias--one 138-kV line and three 69-kV lines--lost service
during the storm, but no customers were affected because power was
automatically rerouted through other lines.
   A total of about 15,000 customers elsewhere on the AEP system in
Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky lost power for a time
because of downed distribution lines, a spokesman said. Power was restored
to most within hours.
   Virginia Power, meanwhile, said as many as 30,000 customers lost power
during the storm, including 2,400 mostly commercial customers in downtown
Norfolk midday Sunday, Jan. 7, due to a conduit fault in an underground
11-kV circuit.
   A spokesman said the utility quickly replaced some 3,000 linear feet of
conduit so it could restore service to all but a few customers by early
Monday. The cause of the fault is still under investigation.
   The bulk of the outages on the Virginia Power system, however, were in
the Northern Neck and Gloucester area south of Washington, D.C., and on the
western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
   Duke Power, in turn, said that as many as 34,000--or about 2%--of its
1.7 million North and South Carolina customers were without power at the
same time during the storm, mostly because of ice-related distribution-line
problems in and near Charlotte, N.C., and Greenville and Clemson, S.C.
   About 8,000 customers remained cut off Monday morning, a spokesman said,
but service was restored to most of them later that day.
   Carolina Power & Light, whose North and South Carolina service
territories experienced a mix of snow, sleet and rain, said it experienced
only one significant outage--affecting about 5,000 customers in the
Sanford, N.C., area, south of Raleigh.
   And Monongahela Power, whose West Virginia service territory was
blanketed with two feet of snow, said only a few dozen customers lost power
during the storm. A spokeswoman noted that while cold temperatures
increased residential demand over the weekend and on Monday, demand from
industrial and commercial customers was off sharply as businesses closed
because of the snow.

ENERGY INITIATIVES WINS FIRST ROUND ON FIRM CAPACITY PAYMENTS IN FLORIDA

Lake Cogen, a 112-MW project developed by Energy Initiatives, won a partial
summary judgment Jan. 4 in a case filed against Florida Power in state
circuit court in Lake County (No. 94354 CA-01, Division 8).
   The case revolves around whether firm capacity payments should be made
based on a model used by Florida Power, or a separate method the developers
of the gas-fired cogeneration facility said was specified in the contract.
Florida Power pays NUGs both capacity and energy payments when the
theoretically avoided generating unit would operate, but only as-available
or energy payments if the avoided unit would have been off-line.
   Florida Power claimed the theoretically avoided 500-MW pulverized coal
plant equipped with a scrubber, which was used to determine capacity and
energy payments, would be used by the utility based on four criteria to
determine when the plant would be dispatched on an economic basis. The four
parameters were the cost of variable operations and maintenance, the price
of coal, the heat rate of the unit, and a fuel multiplier of 1.
   In its motion, Lake Cogen contended other factors, such as environmental
compliance, should be used in determining economic dispatchability of a
generating unit. It said an actual, operating plant should be used for
comparison, namely Florida Power's coal-fired Crystal River units Nos.
1-2.
   Judge Don Briggs ruled the parameters for dispatchability should be
based on a real unit and not only the four Florida Power was using. He
ordered that a more accurate model be developed to determine how much Lake
Cogen should be paid. That cost information will be compared to actual
payments, which could be used to determine an award at a later date,
assuming the model shows Lake Cogen was underpaid. A schedule for further
proceedings had not be set.
   Fama confirmed that two other NUGs, Pasco Cogen and Orlando Cogen, have
similar court actions pending.
   Lake Cogen is located in Umatilla, Fla., and sells steam to Golden Gem
Growers. Partners in the project along with Energy Initiatives are Lake
Investment Holdings and NCP Lake Power Inc.

PANDA ENERGY, FLORIDA POWER CONTINUE FIGHT OVER PROJECT IN POLK COUNTY

Panda Energy and Florida Power have traded lawsuits in a dispute over
Panda's proposed project in Polk County.
   Panda was allowed to voluntarily withdraw without prejudice a
$345-million federal suit it had filed against Florida Power (SPR, 1l Aug
'95, 1), but Florida Power has since filed suit against Panda. In addition,
the state Public Service Commission denied two requests made by Panda in a
related action.
   The anti-trust suit Panda withdrew in U.S. District Court for the Middle
District of Florida, Tampa Division (Case No. 95-992-CIV-T-24 C), alleged
Florida Power unfairly interfered with its construction of a cogeneration
plant which was to have supplied Florida Power with 74.9 MW of firm power
under a standard offer contract.
   Panda's general counsel Bill Nordlund said the withdrawal was a
strategic move, ``and we still plan to prosecute this matter and move
forward on it.'' He would not specify when or in what venue.
   The countersuit filed by Florida Power at the end of December sought
declaratory judgments answering the allegations included in Panda's suit,
in case Panda refiled the case, according to Florida Power attorney Jim
Fama (95-2145-CIV-T-25-B).
   Florida Power asked the court to rule that:
Panda did not have a superior legal right to negotiate for a natural gas
transmission contract with the city of Lakeland, and that the utility did
not interfere with Panda's rights with the city;
  -- Panda is not entitled to a standard-offer contract if it builds a unit
larger than 75 MW;
  -- Panda is not entitled to payments under a standard-offer contract
beyond December 2016; and
  -- Panda has breached its contract by failing to begin construction on
the unit.
   The suit also sought relief from the court.
   On Jan. 3, the PSC refused to reconsider a decision the PSC made on Dec.
5, which said the PSC did have jurisdiction over standard-offer contracts
and the Florida Power/Panda dispute. It also refused to grant Panda a
90-day extension beyond Jan. 5 to file testimony in that case (Docket No.
950110-EI). As a result, a hearing at the PSC was scheduled for Feb. 19, a
staff recommendation was due April 18, and the commission was scheduled to
vote on April 30.

NCEMPA-1 TO USE NEW METERING EQUIPMENT TO EASE ENTRY INTO WHOLESALE MARKET

North Carolina Municipal Power Agency No. 1 said it is gearing up to enter
the Southeast wholesale power market over the next few months, and is
installing new wholesale delivery point metering equipment that will enable
it to predict with considerable accuracy how much surplus non-firm energy
it has to sell.
   NCMPA-1, part of Raleigh-based ElectriCities of North Carolina Inc.,
arranges wholesale power for 19 municipal utilities in the western part of
the state, including larger munis like those in High Point and Gastonia and
smaller ones like those in Lincolnton, Cherryville and Pineville.
   Through plant co-ownership and exchange agreements it signed with Duke
Power more than a decade ago, the agency is entitled to 850 MW from Duke's
2,200-MW Catawba nuclear power station in Clover, S.C. The investor-owned
utility agreed to buy back a significant portion of NCMPA-1's entitlement
initially, then decreasing amounts until the buy-back period ends around
the turn of the century.
   In part because Duke also agreed to buy back--at a relatively low
price--any surplus energy NCMPA-1 may have, and because of a
first-right-of-refusal clause that enabled Duke to match any offer another
potential buyer might make for that surplus, the agency made no real effort
in the 1980s and first half of the 1990s to market its surplus to others.
   Recently, however, NCMPA-1 and Duke reached an agreement that resolves
the first-right-of-refusal issue, and the agency decided to install special
metering equipment at key wholesale delivery points to its member munis to
provide it with real-time information about muni demand.
   That data also will enable NCMPA-1 to predict how much surplus energy it
will have available for sale, said Woody Adams, NCMPA-1's power-supply
manager.
   Adams told Southeast Power Report that while his agency always has had
the right to sell surplus energy, ``we didn't havethe ability to know on a
timely basis how much surplus energy we had'' available for sale.
   He predicted that in 1996 NCMPA-1 will have at least 500 GWh and
possibly as much as 600 GWh of surplus energy for sale either through the
Automated Interchange Matching System (AIMS) or through bilateral deals,
and that that amount would grow to at least 1,000 GWh by 2000.
   ``The surplus will be available primarily in the off-peak hours,'' Adams
said, with more--including, perhaps, some peak-hour energy--available in
non-summer months, but at least some available at night and on weekends all
12 months of the year. He said summer-peaking NCMPA-1 sees particular
promise in ``seasonal diversity'' deals with winter-peaking entities to its
north and west, as well as daily or even seasonal ``energy swaps.''
   The cost of producing the energy in question, he noted, is
``characteristic of typical generation costs for a well-run nuclear unit,''
but he declined to provide specifics. Duke is generally considered to be
one of the nation's premier operators of nuclear facilities.
   ``What we intend to do initially,'' Adams said, ``is to market the
surplus energy on AIMS'' beginning later this winter, ``as well as to enter
into exchange agreements with power marketers and with utilities that are
either directly connected to Duke or that have ready access'' to the
investor-owned utility.
   Duke would have ``as much right as anyone'' to buy power through AIMS,
he said, adding that NCMPA-1 already has signed exchange agreements with
several marketers, including Citizens Lehman Power, Enron Power Marketing,
and LG&E Power Marketing.
   The major advantages of participating in the market, Adams said, ``will
be to give us the contacts and experience we'll need to be active in those
markets as they evolve.''
   The impact of surplus energy sales on NCMPA-1's balance sheet, ``while
significant, will not be a make-or-break thing for us. We see it more as an
initial step toward becoming competitive in deregulated power markets,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, NCMPA-1 also is installing equipment to monitor the loads of
``well over 50'' of its munis' largest retail customers. That equipment,
said Mark Otersen, the agency's supervisor of demand-side operations, will
let NCMPA-1 gather information on customer demand and chart customer load
``shapes''--or patterns of demand.
   That load-shape data, in turn, should help NCMPA-1 design new
demand-side management-related rates for industries with common load
shapes, and help its member munis convince large energy users of the
benefits of using such rates, Otersen said.
   He noted that relatively few of the large retail customers served by
munis in western North Carolina currently participate in load-management
programs that provide incentives to those who agree to let their utility
curtail or interrupt power during peak periods, or who agree to run
peak-shaving standby generators.

LG&E POWER MARKETING SEEKS TO BROKER POWER SALES AND PURCHASES BY TVA

LG&E Power Marketing Inc. (LPM) has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to approve changes in its accounting practices to cover a
contract under which the marketer will broker power sales and purchases by
the Tennessee Valley Authority and assign all gains and losses to its
affiliate Louisville Gas & Electric.
   In a Dec. 15 filing to FERC, LPM said that it was about to enter into an
interchange agreement with TVA under which it would sell energy to TVA and
buy energy for resale to third parties (Doc. No. ER94-1188-000).
   While it will take title to energy received from TVA, it will pass all
benefits from the transactions on to LG&E, thereby maintaining its broker
status in the deals.
   LPM officials said they already perform this non-exclusive brokering
function for LG&E with other energy sellers based on existing general
arrangements with LG&E on file at FERC.
   In the TVA case, however, the two parties will change a system under
which the marketer pays a fee to LG&E for dispatching and transmission
services. Instead of a straight fee, LPM will use the dispatching fee as a
``true up'' mechanism to insure that LG&E receives the full benefit of any
deal involving TVA energy.
   It asked FERC to approve this new arrangement now so that questions
about accounting procedures will not arise later which might hinder LPM's
marketer status and ability to use market-based pricing under FERC
regulations.
   In its filing, LPM also asserted that it was entitled to enter an
interchange agreement with TVA despite a Congressional ban on TVA sales
outside its own territory, because its affiliated franchise, LG&E, was
grandfathered under the 1957 TVA ``fence'' law.
   It also noted that its arrangement with LG&E was not exclusive since any
of its competitors with similar rights could carry out the same services
for LG&E. It said the deal did not in any way increase its market power or
result in undue discrimination or preference and would not be detrimental
to LG&E ratepayers.
   FERC asked for comment by Jan. 12. It appears likely that some utilities
in the region may raise questions about the ``fence issue.''
   Already, in September, when the issue of an interchange between LPM and
TVA first arose, members of Congress asked for an explanation of its legal
aspects. At that time, TVA sent a letter to Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-NC)
assuring him that the arrangement could be done under current fence rules
(SPR, 22 Sept '95, 1).
   At the same time, industry sources said it is possible TVA will attempt
to attach a last-minute amendment to the current budget bill to create a
more explicit permission to allow such interchanges with affiliates of the
14 grandfathered utilities.
   Last summer, TVA publicly pulled back from a plan to introduce
legislation to bring down the fence, and it remains to be seen if it now
will take a piecemeal approach, starting with energy sales to marketers and
energy pools which have immediate applications in the region.

WTU TO SUPPLY CO-OP WITH 11.7 MW, INCLUDING NEW COTTON SPINNING PLANT

Central and South West unit West Texas Utilities has signed a 10-year deal
to supply a total of 11.7-MW to Midwest Electric Cooperative of Roby,
Texas.
   The pact takes effect in two stages. On Sept. 1, 1997, WTU will begin
supplying 5 MW to Midwest to serve the Lortex Industries cotton spinning
plant in Snyder, Texas. The plant represents new load and the entry of a
new industry to that part of Texas.
   On June 1, 1998, it will begin supplying another 6.7 MW. That capacity
has been supplied by TU Electric.
   The contract also has an extended terms provision, meaning that WTU also
will supply any load growth that Midwest experiences at the Lortex
facility.
   WTU said the pact would have a non-fuel revenue impact of $1.4 million
annually when fully implemented. To supply Midwest, WTU will build 39 miles
of 69-kV line and two substations.
   Midwest serves 5,640 members in 10 Texas counties.

LG&E AND LG&E MARKETER MAKE DEAL
WITH OHIO ED SWAPPING COAL FOR POWER

An unusual agreement is in the works among Louisville Gas & Electric, LG&E
Power Marketing and Ohio Edison under which LG&E would supply high-sulfur
coal to Ohio Ed and LPM would receive 300 MW of electricity for one year
from Ohio Ed's Burger power plant.
   An Ohio Ed spokesman confirmed that negotiations are under way but said
a final agreement has not been reached. An LPM spokeswoman said she could
not comment on the proposed arrangement until it is finalized.
   A source familiar with the pending deal said the talks are being
governed by ``very strict confidentiality agreements.'' Apparently, here is
how the transaction would work: LG&E would supply up to 1 million tons of
high-sulfur coal, reportedly from West Virginia, this year to the Burger
plant, located at Shadyside, Ohio.
   In return, LPM would have access to 300 MW of electricity from Burger to
supply its own customers.
   Another Ohio Ed spokesman said he could not comment on the proposed bulk
power agreement because of the ``increasingly competitive'' bulk power
market and electric utility industry.
   The source told The McGraw-Hill Companies' Power Markets Week that such
arrangements may become more commonplace as competition and deregulation
come to the utility industry. ``With a dramatically changing industry such
as the power production industry, you're going to see unusual agreements
more and more,'' she said.
   LPM has been very aggressive since its formation last August. It and
LG&E are subsidiaries of LG&E Energy Corp.

NYMEX LOOKS TO TVA, SOUTHERN COMPANY
AS POSSIBLE FUTURES CONTRACT SITES

With its two proposed electricity futures contracts on track to be
effective this spring, the New York Mercantile Exchange is considering
delivery points in the East to launch further contracts. Among the systems
under consideration in the Southeast are the Tennessee Valley Authority and
the Southern Company system.
   Patrick Thompson, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, last
week predicted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will act on the
exchange's two proposed electricity futures contracts before the end of the
month, which could allow trading to begin by the end of March or early in
the second quarter of this year.
   NYMEX filed supplemental information on its proposed futures contracts
with the CFTC late last month. The material, responding to commission
inquiries concerning the deliverability of the commodity and potential
regulation of electricity futures by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, was filed under a claim of confidentiality and was not made
publicly available.
   The confidential filing cleared the way for CFTC staff to begin
preparing a memorandum for consideration by the commission. The four
sitting commissioners likely will begin considering whether to approve the
contracts later this month, according to a CFTC source.
   Assuming the supplemental filing from NYMEX answers all the questions
raised by the CFTC staff, the memorandum now being drafted could be sent to
the commission within two weeks, the CFTC source said.
   ``I'm really confident now that the CFTC has had all of its questions
answered--both technical and regulatory,'' NYMEX's Thompson said in a
telephone interview last week. ``I expect the approval process to conclude
very quickly.''
   NYMEX is expected to launch both contracts at the same time. The two
contracts are virtually identical, except for the physical delivery points
at the Palo Verde nuclear station switchyard and the California/Oregon
border intertie. The exchange plans to let the markets decide whether one
or both futures contracts will be sustained in the long term.
   NYMEX's advisory group is also considering the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection and American Electric Power's grid as
potential delivery points for further futures contracts in the East.

GREENVILLE, N.C., MUNI USES COINCIDENT
PEAK RATES TO CUT INDUSTRIAL COSTS

Officials of the Greenville Utilities Commission in North Carolina said
that coincident-peak-based rates have not only allowed the muni's existing
industrial customers to cut electric bills, but are helping the muni to
lure new business to the city.
   John Chaffee, executive director of the Pitt County Development
Commission, said industrials that are taking full advantage of the CP rates
pay no more--and sometimes less--than they would for power from neighboring
investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives that serve areas around
Greenville.
   GUC buys all its wholesale power from the North Carolina Eastern
Municipal Power Agency, which in turn buys most of its power from Carolina
Power & Light.
   Because a significant portion of NCEMPA's and the muni's wholesale power
costs is based on their demand during CP&L's highest systemwide demand hour
each month, the muni agency and Greenville have been working hard to
minimize their monthly peaks through, among other things, aggressive
residential load control programs, and programs to help industrials install
peak-shaving generation.
   GUC general manager Roger Jones said the Greenville muni also in
mid-1994 replaced its traditional industrial rate schedule with a new menu
of CP-only rates that all customers with a demand of 750 kW or more must
choose from.
   The GUC typically notifies its industrial customers by automated signal
when it expects a potential coincident-peak period to be approaching; at
that point, the rate agreement says, the customer ``may utilize any means
deemed suitable to reduce its coincident peak demand,'' including, for
instance, temporary production cuts and/or the use of muni-approved
peak-shaving generators.
   Jones said that the muni's 750-kW-plus customers, who also include some
large commercial and institutional accounts, together comprise about
one-quarter of Greenville's total energy use. The CP rates have encouraged
them to reduce their peak-period demand by 15 to 20% from what it typically
would have been without the coincident-peak rates.
   The magnitude of reductions in coincident-peak demand varies widely from
customer to customer, the muni manager said. Some are able only to trim
their demand slightly, while others have been ``very aggressive'' and have
slashed peak-period demand by more than 50%.
   For example, a large Proctor & Gamble manufacturing plant in Greenville
that typically demands about 8 MW reduces its demand to between 1 and 1.5
MW during coincident peaks, Jones noted, saving both P&G and the muni
thousands of dollars in monthly power costs.
   Chaffee said P&G ``basically shuts down production [during forecasted CP
hours] to achieve the maximum possible savings.'' To make the best use of
its down time, he noted, the manufacturer performs required maintenance on
its production and other equipment.
   Chaffee gave as an example the new automobile parts plant that Japan's
ASMO Co. Ltd. in 1994 developed--and in 1995 expanded--in Greenville. The
combined $50-million facility demands about 2.5 MW.
   ``An important issue for ASMO in deciding where to site the [initial]
plant was power costs,'' he said. ``We were able to demonstrate that by
utilizing Greenville's CP rate and installing [a 1-MW peak-shaving
generator to further reduce CP demand] that they would be paying rates
competitive with'' industrial rates offered by Duke Power and other
low-cost, investor-owned utilities in the Southeast.
   Chaffee added, finally, that in his view the CP has been a significant
factor in enabling Greenville to draw increasing numbers of new industries.
He noted that while industrial firms announced $20 million in new
investments in the city in 1992 and $33 million the year after that,
industrial investment jumped to $43 million in 1994 and $55 million in
1995--the first two years the CP rates were mandated.

TECO ROE CAPPED AT 12.5% IN AGREEMENT
TIED TO 260-MW COAL GASIFICATION PLANT

The Florida Public Service Commission voted Jan. 3 to cap the 1996 rate of
return on equity for Tampa Electric at 12.5% and to determine at a future
time how over-earnings might be distributed (Docket No. 950379-EI).
   The action, coming after TECO earned about $45 million more than its
allowed ROE in 1995, will forestall a rate case that would have been filed
in 1996 to pay for a new generating unit.
   In an earlier stipulation with staff, TECO's 1995 earnings were capped
at 12.75% and about $45 million of over-earnings will be deferred until
1997, after TECO's new $550-million, 260-MW integrated coal gasification
combined cycle plant which is in Polk County goes on-line in late 1996
(SPR, 19 May '95, 16). TECO's actual ROE for 1995 was expected to be about
16%.
   The deal between staff and TECO effectively replaced negotiations the
utility was conducting with the Office of the Public Counsel, which
represents ratepayers at the Florida Public Service Commission, according
to OPC attorney Roger Howe (SPR, 31 Dec '95, 11).
   The PSC's action, which was the result of last-minute negotiations
between staff and TECO on 1996 earnings, could mean that any excess
revenues could be used for the plant, a refund, to offset regulatory
assets, or for depreciation in 1997 or later. The PSC will likely make a
decision on disposition of 1996 excesses sometime in early 1997, according
to Tim Devlin of the PSC's Auditing and Finance Division.
   Under the arrangement for 1996, TECO will have an ROE range of 11.5% to
13.5%. However, all of the earnings over 11.5% will be split, which
effectively caps earnings at 12.5%. TECO estimated it will earn about
13.27% in 1996.
   The Polk unit will go into rate base in late 1996 and based on TECO's
earnings projections, which are considered conservative, it will still earn
in excess of its allowed ROE. The 1995 excess carried forward was also
expected to cover the additional cost of the new unit through 1997 and,
possibly, beyond.
   Howe said that, because interest rates were expected to further decline
during the next few years, it was likely the PSC would reduce TECO's
allowed ROE for 1997, which could mean additional excess earnings in that
year, despite the new unit.

NEW GEORGIA POWER RESIDENTIAL DSM
PROGRAM SHIFTS CONTROL TO CUSTOMERS

Georgia Power has proposed to state regulators a new residential load
control program which it says will create 156 MW of savings over 10 years.
   Under the plan, customers would buy the control equipment from Georgia
Power at discounted prices. While this approach is expected to limit
participation to about 10% of all homes, it will only cost the utility a
$20.1-million investment during the 10-year period, meeting the new state
policy limiting DSM spending.
   Under the proposal, submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission
in December, Georgia Power will give its residential users a choice of
three approaches to carry out load control.
   The most sophisticated will be a home control system based on Scientific
Atlanta's ``SuperStat'' thermostat, which will adjust home power use in
response to a ``critical price signal'' from the utility.
   The second approach would use the SuperStat equipment to cycle air
conditioners and other appliances at different times of day based on
prearranged peak and off-peak demand periods. And the third approach will
be to simply offer time-of-use rates to customers with conventional
thermostat control equipment and encourage them to take advantage of price
differentials by voluntarily setting controls.
   Georgia Power said it expects 11,000 customers to actively participate
in this third approach over ten years with a potential savings of 33 MW.
The three programs together would involve about 81,000 homes after 10
years, representing about an 11.2% penetration of the Georgia Power
customer base.

FLA. COMMISSION APPROVES DSM GOALS
AND PLAN FOR LAKELAND ELECTRIC & WATER

The Florida Public Service Commission approved on Dec. 19 conservation
goals and plans for the Lakeland Electric & Water Dept., after the
municipal utility reached agreement with the state's Dept. of Community
Affairs.
   The conservation plan says that by the end of 2005 Lakeland must
guarantee 26.9 MW in winter and 33.5 MW in summer of savings from
residential customers (Docket Nos. 930556-EG and 950445-EG). That same
year, Lakeland plans to guarantee 3.2 MW in winter and 11.6 MW in summer of
savings from commercial/industrial customers.
   The PSC, however, rejected the muni's request to use demand and energy
savings from one customer class to make up shortfalls in another customer
class. The PSC said a ruling on that issue was premature and that Lakeland
should not ask unless the situation occurred.
   Plans for nine other of the state's largest muni's and cooperatives were
approved by the PSC in late November, while plans for the state's four
largest investor-owned utilities received commission approval in May (SPR,
1 Dec., 11; 2 May, 11). Only two utilities required to submit plans remain:
Tallahassee Electric Dept. (Docket No. 930559-EG) and Florida Public
Utilities (Docket No. 930552-EG), which is a small investor-owned utility.

DTI RAISES POSSIBILITY OF SHIPPERS' LEVY FOR TAKE-OR-PAY COSTS

The take or pay liabilities faced by British Gas continue to tax minds
and stir emotions in the industry.  While BG has taken on a chief
negotiator to "lead and direct the renegotiation of gas purchase
contracts", the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has dropped a
potential timebomb in the shape of a possible levy on shippers to cover
the extra cost of high-priced take-or-pay gas.  In addition, delays in
the drafting of licences for shippers and public gas transporters and
the associated transfer documents and special licence conditions have
meant the Appointed Day has slipped from 1 February to 1 March.  This
has raised concerns over a potential delay to the domestic competition
pilot scheme, due to start in the south-west on 1 April.

At a high-level panel meeting between shippers, BG TransCo and Ofgas
last Saturday (6 January), DTI head of oil and gas John Michell
outlined verbally a new Condition 12 for the shippers' licence,
currently being redrafted for release "very soon".  This would allow
the Secretary of State to impose a levy on shippers, via the
transportation charge, to financially benefit suppliers with long-term
take-or-pay obligations.  The size of this levy is not certain,
although 1p or 2p a therm has been mooted.  It is uncertain also quite
how this levy would be passed from TransCo to the appropriate supplier
and whether the recipient will be just British Gas Supply.

While everyone in the industry is waiting to see a written version of
the proposal before giving a considered response, this "Top Gas" type
scheme, similar to that used in Canada, raised initial alarm with both
shippers, who questioned why they should pay for BG's problems, and
with the Gas Consumers Council which feared customers would pick up the
tab.  The last minute nature of the addition of condition 12 means
there will be little time to consider its full implications.  BG said
it remained keen to reach agreement with producers over renegotiated
contracts, but it considered the levy proposal to be a useful
contingency plan.

British Gas has indicated that the first producers to agree to
renegotiate contracts with BG will get best terms.  So far North Sea
producers have shown no inclination to revamp long term take-or-pay
contracts to supply BG at prices well above current competitive market
levels.  The job of BG's new chief negotiator Kenneth Gardener, a
director of Charterhouse Bank, is to persuade producers to come to the
table.  Gardener, who took on his new post on 1 January, has given up
executive duties at Charterhouse but remains a director.

On his appointment last month he acknowledged producers would be
reluctant to re-open legally binding contracts but said he believed a
"win win" position could emerge from negotiations.  He has agreed to
give at least two years to the problem.  BG also underlined the
increased significance of legal issues in its affairs with the
appointment of William Friedrich, formerly with international law firm
Shearman & Sterling, as its general counsel.

Levy proposal

The DTI is maintaining that its levy proposal is still under
consideration and would be included in the licence on a contingency
basis only.  No decision has been made as to whether the condition
would be invoked.  The government may be using it as a threat to
producers to encourage them to sit down with BG to renegotiate
contracts.  However, this could backfire if producers feel they risk
being hit with a "double whammy" whereby they accept a lower price for
gas from BG and are then hit by a levy because other producers have
been unwilling to renegotiate.  Thus the messages coming from the DTI
appear somewhat confusing.

The Gas Consumers Council is concerned that a levy will keep prices for
domestic customers higher than a free market would otherwise deliver.
Council director Ian Powe said: "Contingency provision for a levy on
all shippers would, if implemented, be passed on to consumers in prices
higher than they would otherwise pay.  It must not be seen as anything
more than an insurance policy against British Gas' failure to sort out
its own problems.  Customers can accept no blame for this predicament.
We would need to have very different information than we have now in
order to concede that any of British Gas' contractual liabilities
should be passed on to its own and other suppliers' customers".  The
Council has asked for full disclosure of all facts before any levy is
imposed and on 12 December proposed that the House of Commons Trade and
Industry Committee should conduct an enquiry into public interest
issues arising from BG's take-or-pay commitments.

BG is now working on the transferal of its supply contracts (and the
related take-or-pay obligations) to a new subsidiary.  Under the new
Gas Act the same company is not allowed to act as a public gas
transporter and gas supplier.  This restructuring will take place on
the Appointed Day.  During debate of the Gas Bill, producers expressed
concern that BG would be able to offload its take-or-pay liabilities
into a number of subsidiaries without proper guarantees.  Amendments to
the Act mean there will be a single trading subsidiary, but some
questions still remain over the fact that this subsidiary will have no
parent guarantee.  How will the DTI ensure the long-term funding and
solvency of the subsidiary to make sure it is not allowed to fall into
bankruptcy to avoid take-or-pay commitments?

Appointed Day

Another important issue discussed at the panel meeting was the timing
of the Appointed Day for licences and introduction of the Network Code.
 DTI confirmed that while a final draft of the suppliers' licence had
been issued, the shippers' licence still needed completion of the
controversial condition 12.  Michell said the public gas transporters'
licence, the transfer scheme and special licence conditions had slipped
badly in the drafting timetable, due to the time required to turn
policy into legal drafting, as opposed to policy difficulties.
Slaughter and May was working on the special conditions, but he was not
entirely confident that all the licence documentation would be in place
by 1 February, the proposed Appointed Day.  Accordingly it was agreed
that the Appointed Day should be moved to 1 March, with a panel meeting
on 2 February to confirm this date.  Energy balancing will be
introduced from 1 September.

The big question is how this delay will affect the proposed 1 April
date for the introduction of the domestic competition pilot scheme.
While it is the job of the Domestic Competition Steering Group, chaired
by Clare Spottiswoode, to discuss this issue, it was agreed at the
panel meeting that TransCo should continue with its current timetable
for systems implementation and testing.  SPA is already under trial,
and nomination and confirmation of all sites by shippers will utilise
the SPA system from 1 February.  The Gti system would not be used for a
start date of supply beyond 1 February, but would be retained for
invoicing purposes.  While some shippers were still concerned over the
accuracy of their sites and meters portfolios, most felt they were
workable and were not a reason for delay, as long as a suitable
reconciliation process for disputes was established.  Dual billing of
sites was being tackled among the shippers themselves, but some sites
remained without any nomination.

The running and testing of SPA is seen by many shippers as one of the
most important systems steps for the domestic trial, and suppliers such
as Amerada Hess and Total, who are committed to participating in the
first trial, remain optimistic that the 1 April date can be maintained.
 However, TransCo itself has been giving conflicting messages over its
attitude to the timing of the pilot.  Having originally requested six
months between the implementation of the Network Code and the domestic
competition pilot, in order to test systems thoroughly, TransCo had
reluctantly agreed to first a four-month and then a two-month gap.  The
shift from 1 February to 1 March for Network Code implementation means
the gap will narrow to one month, although systems testing will be
underway before the official start date.

Systems failure

While some in TransCo appear to have indicated a willingness to
consider this option, managing director Harry Moulson came out very
strongly in favour of delaying the pilot in a Times interview this
week.  He suggested the introduction of domestic competition should be
delayed until June because the computer system is untried and could
fail.  He said it would be "ludicrous" to press ahead with the trial in
April, as there were significant risks, including the worst outcome
where a breakdown left TransCo unable to maintain pipeline pressure.  A
more likely risk, he suggested, would be an inability for TransCo to
confirm meter readings if too many customers wished to switch supplier.
 He also admitted that TransCo's service to its customers had been
"bloody awful" last year, and although it was improving he felt there
was a way to go.

Ofgas has indicated there should be "a searching review to determine
why the 1 April date cannot be retained for the introduction of the
domestic market".  Chris Rees from Touche Ross has been taken on as a
"troubleshooter" reporting to Ofgas, to examine whether the 1 April
deadline is feasible or whether the start-up date should be delayed by
a month or two.  He is currently visiting interested parties and is
expected to make his recommendation in late February.  It is likely the
introduction will be on a quota or rationed basis, with say a maximum
of 1,000 confirmations per day in the early days to minimise system
strain.

BG RANKED SIXTH IN SURVEY OF OVERALL GAS COMPANY PROFITABILITY

British Gas ranks sixth in terms of overall composite profitability in
comparison with 159 gas companies surveyed worldwide in 1994, according
to a survey* compiled by the Sheffield Energy & Resources Information
Services (SERIS).  Based on 1992-1994 information, the survey uses
operating and financial data to rank the upstream and downstream
activities of gas companies in 48 countries, according to 25
competition and performance indicators.  The information is also used
to compile a profitability index, headed in 1994 by Statoil as the top
performing company, against which the remaining companies are measured
(see table).  In the index the company's absolute profit, profit margin
and rate of return on assets are combined and given equal weight.
However, SERIS points out that the accuracy of the information is
dependent on the operations of each company and on its willingness to
disclose such data.

In compiling the survey, SERIS considered each company's upstream
operations and downstream gas pipeline and marketing segments, and used
the information to rank the following companies:

* top five gas production companies in 1994: Russia's Gazprom with
20,150.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf), Algeria's Sonatrach (4,569.8 Bcf),
Indonesia's Pertamina (2,661.0 Bcf), the UK's Royal Dutch/Shell Group
(2,574.0 Bcf) and Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco (2,479.1 Bcf);

* top five companies for gas pipeline sales in 1994: Dutch company
Nederlandse Gasunie with 2,899.4 Bcf, Germany's Ruhrgas (2,006.1 Bcf),
Italy's ENI subsidiary SNAM (1,707.9 Bcf), France's Gaz de France
(1,329.5 Bcf) and the US's Tenneco (870.5 Bcf).  British Gas, in second
place in SERIS's 1993 ranking, declined to disclose a figure for gas
sales because of "the commercial sensitivity of the data in the run up
to competition in the gas market".  Similarly, British Gas's market
rivals were equally unwilling to disclose figures to SERIS;

* top five companies for total gas pipeline throughput volume in 1994
(gas pipeline sales plus gas transported for third parties): Canada's
Nova Corp with 4,089.0 Bcf, the US's Tenneco (3,328.0 Bcf), Nederlandse
Gasunie (3,164.2 Bcf), Slovakia's Slovak Gas Industry (SPP) (2,765.0
Bcf) and the US's Panhandle Eastern Corporation (2,498.0 Bcf).  British
Gas's figures for throughput volume (2,197 Bcf) put the company into
eighth place in 1994 compared with fifth place in 1993;

* top five companies for gas marketing sales in 1994 (sales of bought-
in third party gas by marketing subsidiaries): US company Enron Corp
with 2,489.6 Bcf, the US's Natural Gas Clearinghouse (1,286.0 Bcf),
Canada's Transcanada Pipelines Ltd (1,171.3 Bcf), the US's Panhandle
Eastern Corp (1,134.6 Bcf) and the US's Coastal Corp (989.0 Bcf);

* top five most profitable gas companies in absolute terms in 1994:
Italy's SNAM, with an operating profit of US$1,920m, British Gas with
$1,356m, Gaz de France with $872.8m, Transcanada Pipelines with $733.9m
and Norway's Statoil with $603.4m.

SOME GAS PRICES LINKED TO PRICE OF ELECTRICITY

It appears some companies supplying gas to power plants have been
offering contracts where the gas price is linked to the price of
electricity in the pool, thus protecting generators from a price
squeeze following changes in the electricity price.

This is seen as a marketing tool to secure sales in a market under
pressure from falling gas prices and surplus supplies.  It carries
risks of large losses for the gas supplier and such deals may be
offered at a premium.

Scottish Hydro is one generator that is believed to have agreed a gas
contract with around 40% linked to the electricity pool price.

Gas prices are more usually linked to an indicator such as the retail
price index.

UK ENERGY PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION

Provisional statistics showing energy production and consumption in the
three months September to November 1995, published by the Department of
Trade and Industry, show that production of indigenous primary fuels,
at 67.9 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) was 5.4% higher than in
the corresponding period a year ago.

Production of coal, natural gas, primary electricity and petroleum rose
by 12.0%, 7.8%, 4.3% and 3.2% respectively.  Deep-mined coal was 21.0%
higher than in the same period a year ago as the newly privatised
companies increased production.

Total inland consumption of primary fuels, which includes deliveries
into consumption, during the three months September to November 1995,
at 52.9 mtoe was 0.6% less than in the same period a year ago.

Consumption of natural gas increased by 9.0% largely due to low
consumption in November 1994 because of exceptionally mild weather, and
a significant increase in use for electricity generation in September
to November 1995, compared with the same period a year earlier.

Consumption of petroleum and coal fell by 3.7% and 9.7% respectively.

BRITISH GAS TO DRILL OFF THE LANCASHIRE COAST

British Gas Exploration and Production (E&P) is to drill an exploration
well some 11 kilometres southwest of Formby Point on the Lancashire
Coast.  This will be the fifth well it has drilled in exploration block
110/14.

A jack-up drilling rig, the Global Adriatic XI, will be towed to
location and will drill to a depth of approximately 1,350 metres
beneath the seabed.  Drilling will last about two weeks.

The target reservoir is the same as the Morecambe fields, already
developed by British Gas.  An extensive survey of the area was
undertaken before the decision was made to drill, said BGE&P.

British Gas is the main acreage holder in the Irish Sea, currently
operating 19 blocks in the East Irish Sea, North Channel and Caernarvon
Bay, and participating in four others in the East Irish Sea.

OFGAS SEMINAR ON PREPAYMENT METERS

Ofgas held another seminar last month at the Church House Conference
Centre, this time to discuss and seek views on the thorny issue of
access by future domestic gas suppliers to prepayment meters.

Suppliers need access to prepayment technology to be able to meet their
licence obligations. The current Quantum System is viewed as the only
realistic technology for the competitive market, however it is a system
firmly stamped with the BG logo.

The aim of the seminar was to discuss and get agreement on what has
been called a short term solution to allow prepayment  supply from the
start of a competitive gas market, but which is not necessarily the
long term solution.

The main thrust appears to suggest suppliers will need to agree among
themselves a series of prices for gas supplied through a prepayment
meter.

Data constraints in the Quantum System, which was originally designed
for an integrated supplier, mean that it would be difficult and costly
for each supplier to have its own individual price.

BG TRANSCO PROPOSES HIGHER RANGE FOR COST OF CAPITAL ESTIMATES

BG TransCo has published a paper on its cost of capital, the first in a
series that will consider specific elements of the current price
control formula review.  The paper has been made public to stimulate
debate and add transparency to the process, said TransCo.  It concludes
that the range for TransCo's cost of capital, or allowed rate of
return, is now 7.4%-8.9%, with the actual cost towards the upper end of
this range.  This compares with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
1993 enquiry which estimated the range for TransCo's cost of capital
was 6.5%-7.5% pre-tax.

In a letter to Ofgas director general Clare Spottiswoode, TransCo
managing director Harry Moulson said the change in estimate is partly
due to factors exogenous to TransCo including the MMC's revised figures
for the equity risk premium and changes to the advance corporation tax.
 However, he suggests a more specific reason is a change in the
riskiness of TransCo relative to the stock market as a whole.  He said
the beta coefficient had become more volatile and had risen to a value
in the range 0.83-0.93, compared with the MMC beta estimate of 0.86.

Moulson suggests this increase reflects changing market and regulatory
conditions and is likely to continue over the next few years.
Separation of transportation and trading and the introduction of
competition have increased the market-related risk of transportation.
The report suggests "the systematic risk that TransCo faces is
comparatively high in relation to other utilities.  On a qualitative
assessment of the market risk facing utility companies, TransCo ranks
higher than the water and electricity companies, but lower than
telecommunications".  TransCo argues that the company should therefore
have a higher cost of capital, towards the upper end of the range of
7.4%-8.9%.  It suggests "failure to provide this will be to the
detriment of the financial viability of the business and will undermine
incentives to invest".

TransCo is organising a seminar early this year, to which it will
invite Ofgas, shippers and academics to discuss its analysis.  It
intends to publish a second paper on the asset base for consideration.

DECEMBER 1995 FIRM GAS PRICES NEARLY 30% LOWER THAN YEAR BEFORE

A sample of prices from clients of energy specialists John Hall
Associates showed that for customers using more than 25,000 therms per
year, the volume weighted average firm gas price in December 1995 of
18.72 pence per therm was down 3.01 ppt on the previous month (21.73
ppt) and 3.25 ppt below October's average price.  This December price
was down 7.81 ppt (29.4%) compared with the same month the year before
(December 1994, 26.53 ppt).  However, JHA points out that prices for
currently renewable firm gas contracts are significantly lower at
around 11.5 to 12.0 ppt for customers with good volume and load factor,
a little below the levels in November.

The December 1995 volume weighted price of firm gas in the markets
below 25,000 therms was 23.97 ppt, according to Hall sample figures.
This is 7.95 ppt (24.9%) below the price in the same month the year
before (December 1994, 31.92 ppt), and 1.45 ppt lower than the previous
month's figure (November 1995, 25.42 ppt).  New contracts are being
quoted as low as 15 ppt, or even lower if attached to above 25,000
therm volumes, according to JHA.

At 15.11 pence per therm (ppt), the volume weighted average price of
interruptible gas in December 1995 was down 0.36 ppt on the price the
month before (15.47 ppt) and 0.43 ppt less than the average price in
October (15.54 ppt).  This average December 1995 price is 4.40 ppt
below the average price in the same month in 1994 (19.51 ppt) - a
reduction of 22.6%.   As with firm gas prices, the best interruptible
prices for new contract business are considerably lower at between 10
and 11 ppt, with prices having stabilised over the last few months of
1995.

Having remained steady at around 9.05 to 9.10 ppt during late October
and early November, spot gas prices rose sharply in the last half of
November to break through the 10.00 ppt barrier, based on Bacton
prices.  Prices have since stabilised around 9.95 to 10.15 ppt, with
some increases seen during the period of cold weather.

The discount for supplies from St Fergus compared with Bacton was
around 0.20 to 0.25 ppt until around mid November, when it increased to
over 0.30 ppt.  During December, the discount tended to be around 0.2
ppt.  Prices for the first quarter of 1996, based on Bacton, were
around 10.2 ppt in late December, with the differential between St
Fergus and Bacton ranging between 0.45 and 0.65 ppt during the month.

IRISH INTERCONNECTORS FACE FLAK ON SAFETY AND ECONOMIC GROUNDS

Following a demand from George Foulkes MP for a public enquiry into
safety aspects of the construction by British Gas of the Scotland-
Northern Ireland gas pipeline, the Scottish Office has released results
of its preliminary underwater survey.  Concern had been expressed that
recent pipelaying work had disturbed Second World War explosives dumped
in and around Beaufort's Dyke in the Irish Sea.

Phosphorus flares have been washed up along the south-west Scottish
coast, and the British Geological Survey reported underwater explosions
in this area of the Irish Sea.  The Scottish Office report shows that
munitions were strewn in and around Beaufort's Dyke, sometimes in
relatively shallow water, but concluded there was no risk to the public
or marine life.

Offshore pipelaying work by Premier Transco, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of British Gas, was halted briefly in late October, but the prohibition
order was lifted by the Health and Safety Executive after five days (UK
Gas Report, issue 47, 3 November 1995, page 4), allowing the company to
finish laying, trenching and pressure testing of the complete offshore
section of the pipe.

A Premier Transco spokesman told UK Gas Report 42 kms of 24 inch pipe
had been laid and some work had been completed on the onshore section
in Scotland.  This work had been suspended during the winter for
environmental reasons, to reduce land damage, and would resume in the
spring, together with work on the 3km onshore link to the Ballylumford
power plant in Northern Ireland.

He said the project was on schedule for completion in October this
year.  Planning permission had also been given for a pipeline to
Carrickfergus to allow the development of a downstream gas market in
Northern Ireland (UK Gas Report, issue 47, 3 November 1995, page 12).
He anticipated the first customers could be supplied with natural gas
by the end of the year.  It is believed that competition in supply for
industrial and commercial customers will be introduced three years
after the start of operations, with full competition after eight years.

Premier Transco has always claimed its offshore pipelaying work posed
no threat to safety or health and had been carried out in accordance
with government safety procedures.  The Scottish Office suggested more
research was needed to see if there was a conclusive link between work
on the pipeline and the emergence of up to 4,000 incendiary bombs on
local beaches.  Commissioning and operation of the pipeline will be
discussed by Premier Transco, the Scottish Office and the Health and
Safety Executive, and Transco says it will continue to act in
accordance with procedures agreed with the DTI, HSE and Ministry of
Defence.  Foulkes and environmental groups have condemned the survey as
being held too late and in the wrong place.

Meanwhile, Ireland's Department of Energy (DoE) has been criticised for
its role in the completed Scotland-Southern Ireland gas interconnector
pipeline, with claims by the country's Comptroller and Auditor General
that the department got its figures wrong in its estimates for the
$373.5m line.  The comptroller, in a report to the government on the
pipeline, says the DoE made serious blunders in its calculations at the
planning stage of the interconnector.  Administration and design cost
$41.2m, some 45% more than budgeted for, while entire costs overran by
$16.5m.  This the comptroller says, was reasonable.  "The $16.5m
represents a reasonable overrun because the scale and complexity of the
project made cost estimation particularly difficult and also because
extra work above that envisaged had to be undertaken."

However, the DoE is blamed for faulty estimates on its rate of return
to the Irish economy, initially estimated at between 23% and 39% but
eventually found to be only around 15% by the EU which assessed the
project for grant aid.  The comptroller found the rate of return to the
economy to be even lower at only 11%.  The department based its rate of
return calculations on costs of $300m at 1990 prices but sought
government approval for the project based on costs of $360m.  In
addition, no provision was made in estimates of project returns for the
foreseeable costs of developing and upgrading existing natural gas
infrastructure, estimated at $240m.

Controversy continues in Ireland over this interconnector, with critics
claiming it is unnecessary and that had Southern Ireland been patient
it could have taken an overland spur from the British Gas
interconnector at a modest cost of around $45m or less.  However,
others argue that the separate pipeline provides valuable security in
alternative supply options.

BG FACES CLAIMS FROM SERVICE CONTRACT CUSTOMERS LEFT IN COLD

British Gas has confirmed that it will compensate domestic customers
covered under its Three Star Service contracts, after repair services
were severely disrupted by freezing weather conditions over the
Christmas period.  The company faced widespread criticism after an
estimated 150,000 of the 3m customers covered by the #104 contract -
the most expensive and popular of four service agreements offered by
British Gas - were left without heating for up to four days.  Under the
terms of the agreement, British Gas pledges to send an engineer to
repair a faulty system within 24 hours if the fault is reported before
7.30am and depending on demand.

According to a spokesman, British Gas plans to "consider each case on
its individual merit" but will award #10 for each day after the 24 hour
call-out period that a contract customer awaited an engineer.  The
company added that it will consider paying costs incurred by customers
covered by the service who were forced to use another company to carry
out repairs.

The Gas Consumers Council criticised British Gas for the delays which
it said were due to the company's redundancy and restructuring
programme.  The Council added that British Gas had failed to make
contingency plans to cope with the cold period after the Council had
warned the company in early December of potential disruption to
services due to staff shortages.  Ian Powe, director of the Council,
said the problem was "fundamental" rather than seasonal, with
complaints about British Gas service contracts trebling in the year
ending November 1995.  He suggested BG should amend the terms of its
three-star contracts or take on more engineers to provide a better
service to justify the high cost.

Responding to the criticism, British Gas said the number of engineers
operating in 1995 (7,500) was the same as in 1993, and that all
businesses had been affected by the extreme weather conditions.  A BG
spokesman added that during the disruptions, priority had been given to
"customers most in need, particularly the elderly and families with
young children and households suffering from a complete central heating
breakdown".

REGULATORS GIVEN DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES AS REVIEWS CONTINUE

Utility regulation is under the spotlight once again as the London
Stock Exchange issues guidelines for regulators releasing sensitive
information and the Labour Party sets up its policy review of energy
regulation.  In addition, it appears the Committee on Standards in
Public Life, chaired by Lord Nolan, may include utility regulation in
its wide-ranging remit.

The London Stock Exchange guidelines conclude a review of the control
of information which could affect the share prices of companies under
the supervision of privatised utility regulators.  Last summer, a row
erupted when information on price controls provided by electricity
director general Professor Stephen Littlechild to regional electricity
companies was leaked, causing a crash in electricity share prices.  The
new guidelines have been drawn up with the agreement of regulators in
the fields of gas, electricity, water, telecommunications, rail,
aviation, environment, television, gaming, and the Lottery.  The Office
of Fair Trading, although not an industry regulator in the same sense,
has agreed to the same guidelines.

The guidelines include:

* a minimum period - not normally more than 24 hours - between giving
sensitive information to a company and its advisers and releasing it
publicly;

* limitation of access to information on a need-to-know basis;

* advice to be given to other parties on the confidential nature of
information;

* lists to be kept of people to whom information has been shown in
advance;

* notification to the Stock Exchange and companies simultaneously;

* consultation with the exchange in the case of a leak, and if
appropriate, immediate release of information.

However, the voluntary guidelines have a get-out clause in that the
exchange recognises that regulators may not always be able to stick "to
the strict letter of these guidelines".  Critics have also suggested
that the guidelines would not have stopped the electricity price
control leak last year, as Offer officials claim they were already pre-
releasing sensitive information no more than 24 hours before
publication.  Some suggest that only simultaneous release of
information to companies and to the exchange could really guard against
that kind of price manipulation.

Richard Kilsby, director of market services at the exchange, said the
new guidelines would "help to prevent disorderly markets and potential
insider dealing in shares of regulated companies before the official
release of sensitive information by the regulators".

Meanwhile, the Labour Party has begun work on its review of energy
regulation, headed by shadow energy minister John Battle.  He believes
the current structure of regulation has failed the customer in terms of
service and prices and is lacking in transparency and consistency.
Labour is thought to favour a single energy regulator served by a panel
of advisers.  A group of industry specialists is being recruited by the
Party to draft a new regulatory framework.  The subject may also come
under further scrutiny by the current government if Lord Nolan decides
to include utility regulation in this year's programme for the
standards in public life committee.  The recent row over the behaviour
of the Lottery watchdog chief has raised again questions of
accountability and standards for regulators.

CONTRACTING ACTIVITY IN DECEMBER STIRS UP JHA MARKET SHARE FIGURES

Figures provided during December to John Hall Associates (JHA) by firm
gas clients using more than 25,000 therms/yr show some significant
changes in market share, reflecting an increase in activity in December
when many of the contracts on the database were due for renewal.

Mobil remains the market leader in this sector, although it lost 1% to
hold a 22% share.  Kinetica gained 1% to 16%, taking over second place
in the sample from Alliance which dropped 6% to 13%.  Eastern Gas
(eGas) saw its recent aggressive marketing pay dividends with a 6% rise
in share to 11%.  AGAS and Quadrant each gained 1% to 8% and 5%
respectively, while Amerada Hess lost 2% to reach 7% of this market in
December.  The "others" category also fell back 1% on the database.

Similarly, within the sub-25,000 therm sector, there was some movement
in market share figures during December.  Alliance remains the major
player, although its share fell 4% to 30% of the non-BG market in the
JHA sample.  Quadrant (including Gas Direct) maintained its overall 22%
on the database, while eGas gained 1% to 10%.  The "others" category
rose 3% to 10%.

A breakdown of figures provided to JHA by interruptible customers
during December shows a sharp increase in eGas' market share, gaining
4% to reach 17% of the total in the sample database.  Using the JHA
database that now excludes single sites of over 100m therms per year
consumption, Business Gas' (BG Supply's) share of the interruptible
market stayed at 25% in December, while Amerada Hess increased by 1%.

Alliance Gas remains a dominant force in this sector, although it lost
4% to register a 24% share in the December JHA sample.  Alliance showed
falls in all market sectors on the database, reflecting JHA's
perception that the company had been much less prominent during the
latest contracting round.  Alliance told UK Gas Report it had been
considering each renewal carefully in the light of tightening margins,
but it had not changed its policy and was not withdrawing from any
markets.  Other significant players in the interruptible gas market
include United Gas (7%), Accord (6%) and Quadrant (5%).  AGAS, Mobil
and Amerada Hess each have a 4% share on the JHA interruptible
database.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION ADOPTS ENERGY POLICY WHITE PAPER

At a meeting on 19 December, the European Commission adopted energy
commissioner Christos Papoustis' proposal for a white paper, entitled
"An energy policy for the European Union", which lays down guidelines
for EU energy policy into the next decade.  However, Papoustis raised
the question of whether it will be possible to achieve the white
paper's objectives without the addition of an Energy Chapter to the
European Treaty - currently the subject of ongoing discussions.

The white paper is the outcome of detailed discussions and
consultations held on the EC's green paper, which was published in
January 1995.  It sets out three strategic objectives for EU energy
policy: overall competitiveness; security of energy supply; and
environmental protection.  To achieve its objectives, the white paper
has established a number of policy guidelines, the first of which is
integration of energy markets.  Liberalisation of the internal market
for electricity and for natural gas is considered to be the key factor
in market integration.

The second policy guideline deals with concerns over the increasing
energy dependency of the EU.  However, the Commission feels that
despite the political risks in some important supplier countries and
growing world energy consumption, security of supply does not at
present warrant crisis measures.  Instead, the Commission will aim to
encourage fuel diversification, energy efficiency and renewable energy
sources as a means of helping to preserve security of supply.

The Commission sees no inherent conflict between improving
competitiveness and protecting the environment and recognises that the
internalisation of environmental costs and benefits offers a way to
integrate environmental concerns by working with the market rather than
against it.  The need to promote sustainable development means the
Commission will seek to encourage energy efficiency and the use of
renewables via a range of policy instruments.  The Commission also
agreed that the role of local authorities should be given more
recognition in national and Community energy policies, as many aspects
of energy policy affect local communities.

Speaking at the meeting where the white paper was adopted, Commissioner
Papoustis said: "A sound and sustainable energy policy is critical for
our future economic development.  This white paper will be our blue-
print for action into the 21st century".  Papoustis outlined the
importance of the paper's objectives to achieve environmental
protection, secure energy supplies, job creation, industrial
competitiveness and balanced regional development.  However, he said:
"If we are to achieve all these objectives, the Commission must raise
the question of whether a modification of the Treaty is necessary, as
Community action is now limited by the absence of clear provisions".

ONSET OF WINTER SEES N.SEA GAS OUTPUT SURGE IN NOVEMBER 1995

British gas production was up 51% in November over the month before,
and 25% higher than in November 1994, according to the latest Royal
Bank of Scotland Oil and Gas Index.  Production reached 8,551 million
cubic feet per day (MMcfd), taking the bank's gas index to 251.6.  Gas
sales were helped not only by the colder weather but also increasing
demand for electricity generation, said the bank.  Gas revenues were
estimated to have risen by #5.17 million a day to #15.86 million a day
during November last year, about 28% higher than in the same month in
1994.  Gas production was at its highest level since March last year.

British Gas' Morecambe field saw the largest increase in output, up 754
MMcfd to 1,325 MMcfd in November.  BP's Bruce field was up by 195 MMcfd
to 667 MMcfd.  Hamilton's Ravenspurn field increased by 194 MMcfd to
291 MMcfd, Marathon's East Brae was up 150 MMcfd to 438 MMcfd, Shell's
Sole Pit field output rose by 136 MMcfd to 339 MMcfd and Shell and
Amoco's Indefatigable field produced 311 MMcfd, up 70 MMcfd on October.
 BP's Cleeton field came back into strong production, rising from just
1 MMcfd to 197 MMcfd.

There were few falls in production, but Mobil's Beryl and Conoco's
Murdoch fields fell by 43 MMcfd to 372 MMcfd and by 41 MMcfd to 38
MMcfd respectively.  At the terminals higher production saw Bacton and
Barrow increase throughput by 752 MMcfd and 754 MMcfd respectively.
Easington increased by 483 MMcfd.

ROUND TABLE CALLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN ENERGY LIBERALISATION

The UK Round Table on Sustainable Development will shortly publish a
report giving broad support for energy market liberalisation, but
calling on the government to set a framework which ensures that energy
markets operate in a way that is consistent with sustainable
development.

The round table is a government appointed committee, set up to provide
advice to the government on sustainable development in the wake of the
Rio environmental conference.  It is chaired by secretary of state for
the environment, John Gummer, and includes representatives from
business, environmental organisations and academics.

At its meeting on 11 December, the round table suggested the
development of competitive markets should increase efficiency of
production and supply and generally provide benefits of reduced prices
and better services for customers.  However, it felt that the market
would not of itself meet all the environmental and social objectives of
a sustainable energy policy.

For this reason the round table concluded that the government should
set objectives and be prepared to use economic instruments, incentives
and regulation where necessary, to ensure that liberalisation is
achieved in the context of a sustainable energy policy.

EUROGAS SLAMS COMMISSION DIRECTIVE ON INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

The proposed European Commission directive on integrated resource
planning (IRP), aiming to introduce rational planning techniques in the
electricity and gas distribution sectors, is "unnecessary, potentially
harmful and discriminatory, as far as gas is concerned" according to
the European Union of the Natural Gas Industry, Eurogas.

The group calls for the directive to be withdrawn and for EU policy to
focus on developing economic conditions, to encourage energy efficiency
through a competitive, commercial market structure.

Eurogas' main objection to the IRP directive proposal, which covers
rational planning activities in both the gas and electricity sectors,
is that it fails to take account of recent efforts by the gas industry
to increase efficient, economic and environmentally acceptable energy
supply and consumption.

These include end-user instruction on efficient energy use, the
promotion of energy audits, R&D into and increased use of energy
efficient appliances and plant, and cooperation with the construction
industry to encourage energy efficient housing, according to Eurogas.

Eurogas also believes an IRP directive is "potentially harmful" since
it threatens to intervene in market conditions where the need for
additional regulation is "not explained or documented".  In particular,
Eurogas says, commercial competition encourages the development of
efficient energy services, especially where companies must compete
against other energies to offer "best economic conditions to their
customers' needs, which includes energy efficiency and low cost, and
which applies to gas as much as to the alternative fuels".

Furthermore, the proposal is unfairly biased towards gas and excludes
other energies which compete in the same market and on balance
"contribute for each unit of energy produced more to greenhouse gas
emissions", said Eurogas.  Bearing in mind that the objective of the
IRP directive proposal is to reduce emissions, Eurogas feels that the
energy efficient merits of gas over other energies such as oil should
be given greater consideration.

Finally, the group points out that the directive "ignores and
misrepresents the actual situation in the European energy market" by
referring to out-of-date studies relating to electricity.

Instead, Eurogas calls on the Commission to compile a comprehensive
study of Europe's energy market needs and of possible initiatives to
"support existing policies and practices promoting energy efficiency in
the market place", with a view to publishing the findings as a
Commission Communication or Recommendation.

POWERGEN CHP CONTRACT TO SUPPLY CONOCO'S HUMBER REFINERY

PowerGen CHP Ltd has been awarded a contract to supply the electricity
and steam requirements of Conoco Ltd's Humber Refinery.

The contract, which reflects a long-term commercial relationship
between the companies, will involve the construction of a new gas-fired
combined heat and power plant rated at 24 megawatts electrical and over
90 megawatts thermal.

The CHP plant - with capital costs of almost #23 million - will feature
four independent gas turbines with back-up systems to ensure continuous
running even when the primary gas supply is unavailable.

To coincide with the plant construction, a connection between the
refinery and the existing Theddlethorpe to Killingholme gas pipeline
will be installed by Kinetica, the PowerGen/Conoco joint venture.

PowerGen CHP managing director Bob Kennett said: "We have broken new
ground in meeting the requirements of Conoco for efficient but flexible
plant.  Both parties can be confident that the energy supply will
support the refinery's demands in future."

STATOIL CONSIDERING SELLING ESTUARY FUELS

Statoil is thought to be considering selling its Irish oil and gas oil
importer, Estuary Fuels Ltd, which it acquired recently when it took
over Aran Energy, the Dublin explorer.

Estuary is 80% owned by Statoil, with the remainder held by Irish
farmer co-ops who are thought to be keen to liquidate their holdings
and diversify into CHP.

Estuary leases 44 petrol filling stations in the south and south west
of Ireland and owns a further two.

Two potential buyers are thought to have considered Estuary prior to
the successful Statoil bid for Aran, and Bord na Mona, the state peat
producer, is considered a likely buyer.

Bord na Mona is keen to diversify into other energy markets, including
gas.  The peat company was recently freed of most of its debt mountain
by the Irish government, and is managed by Dr. Eddie O'Connor, formerly
head of energy supply purchasing at state electricity company, ESB.

NESTE TO SELL ITS 50% SHARE IN SOVEREIGN

Following the completion of the sale of Neste's UK oil assets to Sands
Petroleum AB, Neste Oy, the Finnish oil, energy and chemicals company,
has agreed to sell its 50% share in Sovereign Exploration Ltd to
Northgas Ltd, a subsidiary of Northern Electric plc.

In January 1994 Neste and Northern Electric formed an upstream gas
company based on Neste's Southern Gas Basin interests, including the
Victor gas field (UK Gas Report, issue 4, 28 January 1994, page 1).

In addition to Victor, Sovereign Exploration has holdings in the
Schooner field which starts production at the end of 1996 and in the
Windermere development.

Neste has stated its intention to focus its upstream activities on
Norway, the Middle East and Russia.  Coinciding with the sale of its UK
activities, Neste is relocating its international business unit (which
is responsible for activities in the Middle East) from London to new
offices in Dubai.

IRISH BOTTLED GAS COMPANY TRADING PROFITABLY

Blugas plc, the Irish bottled gas company that fell into surprise half
year losses of Ir.#400,000 to the end of September last, now says it is
trading profitably, having shed top management and drafted in
accountants to manage the company short term.

However, part or the entire equity of this company may be sold.  Around
70% of the equity is Swiss controlled, through Jones group plc of
Dublin, with the remainder held by Irish interests.

Some of this equity may be taken up by Irish state peat board, Bord na
Mona, already selling peat and coal to households, and keen to expand
into other energy products.

Blugas has around 15% of the local bottled gas market, a fiercely
competitive market dominated by Calor and Flogas.

Calor and Flogas combined last year with Temp Technology of Dublin for
an assault on the local LPG-CHP market, but Blugas was excluded.

BRISTOL CITY COUNCIL TENANTS TO BENEFIT FROM NEW CHP SYSTEM

Bristol City Council and its tenants are to benefit from lower energy
bills and better heating following the installation of a new, high
efficiency combined heat and power (CHP) system at the City's Barton
Hill estate.

The project, according to the CHP Association, was supported by a grant
of #75,000 from the Association's Residential CHP Programme.

The new CHP system generates heating for the 715 homes on the estate,
and power to offset the City Council's electricity costs.

CHPA said that tenants across the city will benefit from the energy
cost savings which CHP's inherently high efficiency delivers to the
council - a proportion of the savings will be invested in further
initiatives by the City's Energy Efficiency Unit. Meanwhile electricity
bills for the City's Council House will be reduced by an estimated
#43,000 a year.

The new system, opened on 7 December by CHPA vice president Peter Rost,
is the latest in a series to be supported under the #2 million
Residential CHP Programme, created and managed by the CHPA for the
Energy Saving Trust.

CAMPAIGN TO WIN SUPPORT FOR DISPOSAL OF OFFSHORE INSTALLATIONS

The oil and gas industry has launched a campaign to win over public
support for a wide range of disposable strategies for its redundant
offshore  installations.

The industry has refused to rule out deep sea dumping as an option for
the future, despite the Greenpeace Campaign which forced Shell to
abandon its plans to dump the Brent Spar facility. However, players
have acknowledged the need to be more transparent and open when
considering options.

"Events of the past few months have persuaded the industry that we need
to do more to understand better public concerns and to encourage
positive participation on the issue," said Dr Harold Hughes, director
general of the UK Offshore Operations Association (UKOOA).

With over 300 oil and gas installations due for decommissioning in the
North Sea and North Atlantic, Hughes estimated about 50 installations
could be decommissioned in the next decade at a cost of #1.5 billion.
As much as half of that cost would be met by the taxpayer.

UKOOA has suggested at least 75% of the installations will be disposed
of on land.

The European Commission will be reviewing the "economic and
environmental aspects" of the dumping of platforms in its review this
year.

However, no decision has been made in Brussels on whether to ban deep
sea dumping.

WYBREW LEADING CONTENDER FOR APPOINTMENT TO BRITISH GAS

We understand John Wybrew is the leading contender for appointment to
the main board of British Gas as director of communications strategy

The appointment is seen as an attempt by BG to improve its public image
following a disastrous year in terms of public relations, including
chief executive Cedric Brown's salary increase.

Wybrew is currently on the board of Shell UK as corporate affairs
director.

It appears Peter Sanguinetti, the current head of corporate
communications, will remain with the company.

NEW SENSOR FOR DETECTION OF FLAMMABLE HYDROCARBONS

AMG Systems has developed a new sensor for the detection and
measurement of flammable hydrocarbons.

AMG says the sensor is intrinsically safe as it uses a patented
infrared light emitting diode (LED), in place of the usual heated
filament bulbs which themselves present an explosion hazard.

The research programme received a support award from the Department of
Trade and Industry and has attracted interest and support in the US.

BORD GAIS OFFERING GRANT TO SWITCH TO NATURAL GAS

Irish state gas distributor, Bord Gais, is offering households a grant
of Ir.#800 to switch heating systems to natural gas.

This scheme is believed to be annoying the local LPG, electricity and
coal industries,

who see it as an abuse of the state company's monopoly position.

There is also independent criticism from builders, who claim they
notice in the course of renovation of homes that owners wastefully
leave on their central heating, even in summer.

It is claimed householders are trying to use sufficient units to reach
targets set by Board Gais that bring qualification for company bonus
schemes.

Other critics suggest Ireland is giving little thought to likely gas
prices in the decades to come, assuming a never ending era of low gas
prices.

HOUSEHOLD BILLS COULD RISE BY ONE THIRD

Charity Age Concern has estimated that the average household bill could
rise by almost one third this winter because of the bitterly cold
weather and the addition of 8% VAT to domestic gas bills.

The government has a system of cold weather payments for households
which are payable when the temperature falls to freezing for seven
consecutive days.

However, only certain people are eligible for the #8.50 allowance.

To qualify for the payment, recipients must be claiming income support
and either 60 or over and claiming the basic state pension, disabled or
living with a disabled person, or with a dependent child under five.

TESORO RE-ASSURES JOBBERS FOLLOWING BOARD OVERTHROW THREAT

Dissident shareholders may push Tesoro to sell refining
division, following move to oust entire board of directors.

Bid, led by Lafayette, La.-based Stone Energy Corp. chairman
James H. Stone, seeks to improve company value through increased
stock price.

To reach that goal, group would install handpicked board and
likely sell off Tesoro's refinery business to focus instead on
exploration and production, according to papers filed with
Securities & Exchange Commission Dec. 26.

Shareholder action comes on heels of company decision to pull
out of California market (OW 12/25).

Company shuts down terminals at Sacramento, Calif., (172,000
barrels) and Stockton (57,000 bbl.) by mid-January.

Meantime, Tesoro's branded push in Pacific Northwest (OW 7/3)
shouldn't be affected by legal swirl.

Several Tesoro jobbers in Oregon told Oil Week last week that
company has assured them Tesoro flags will continue to fly
regardless of shareholder suit outcome and shut-down of
California terminals.

"We're not concerned by news" after talking with marketing rep,
jobber said.

Other jobbers report sales have picked up since they rebranded
to Tesoro.

Portland-area jobber Johnson Oil rebranded Astoria station in
June and followed with Seaview and Knappa sites in Fall.

"The brand's working," jobber said.  Johnson will rebrand fourth
station in Manzanita when it gets signage approval from city
council.

Tesoro spokesman declined to comment on dissident shareholder
suit.

Stone spokesman also declined comment.  However, Stone Energy
issued statement last week saying move was part of Chairman
Stone's personal investment strategy and not a company action.

GREENS SLAM ELECTRIC CAR DELAY

California Air Resource Board staff report recommends axing 2%
electric car sales in 1998, delaying "zero-emission vehicle"
mandate until at least 2003.

CARB would vote on final plan in March following public
hearings.

Agency earlier told staff to come up with a new plan because E-
car technology is too primitive, expensive and consumer-
unfriendly (OW 11/27).

ZEV Environmental Alliance, a "green" group favoring electric
cars, fears latest CARB delay may be prelude to yet another E-
car delay when 2003 deadline for 10% ZEV sales approaches.

Massachusetts and New York may also delay any ZEV mandate
because they're following whatever California does.

Anti-ZEV group, Californians Against Hidden Taxes (CAHT),
praises CARB staff report for axing 1998 deadline.

But group says it's dismayed that CARB plan would eventually
mandate electric cars, since that would only result in a 1% air
quality improvement at a cost in excess of $20 billion.

CAHT spokesperson Anita Mangels says it's time for CARB to look
for other, more cost-effective measures to clean up the air.

CARB might "chicken out" on costly, consumer-unfriendly ZEV
mandate as 2003 approaches, but Mangels says consumers have no
assurance that.

Many observers feel CARB can't mandate ZEVs in 1998 because of
growing voter/consumer revolt against costly, impractical
government mandates and subsidies.

DEALERS ASK COURT TO STOP BELOW-COST

Below-cost sales fight in Southern Florida heats up, with a
jobber filing a below-cost selling lawsuit against an Amoco
branded retailer.

Jobber, Maximo Investments, is joined by Mobil dealer Jorgelina
Lago, M & H Citgo, and Sunshine Gasoline Distributors in suit
against ISJ Energy.

Suit, filed in circuit court in Dade County, also names Jay
David Weinstock as defendant.

Suit seeks damages in excess of $45,000 under state's Motor Fuel
Marketing Practices Act.

Sunshine owns and manages Miami Palm Plaza Mobil with Lago as a
contract operator.

Sunshine also provides management services for a Miami-area
Citgo station owned by Maximo.

M & H Citgo is a contract operator for Maximo's station.

ISJ owns an Amoco branded station nearby, managed by Weinstock.

Florida law prohibits below-cost sales where the effect injures
competition.  Retailers are, however, allowed to sell below
their cost in order to meet competition.

Suit alleges Amoco station has sold between 7-11 cents/gal.
below cost on all grades since November 1.

That's in a market where dealer laid-in cost was about
$1.059/gallon for regular unleaded and retailers were selling
for 99.9 cents/gal.

Suit seeks actual damages in excess of $15,000, plus attorney's
fees.  Suit also seeks injunctive relief.

ISJ signed consent decree with attorney general in 1992 for
below-cost selling at another Amoco branded outlet.

In light of alleged violation of consent decree, suit requests
court treble actual damages.

Retailers in Southern Florida complain Attorney General rarely
enforces below-cost law because it is unpopular politically.

So, jobbers and dealers are taking matters into their own hands
in the courts.

SUWANNEE SWIFTY EXITS ALA.

Florida-based C-store chain Suwannee Swifty completes exit from
Alabama with sale of four stores to Griffin, Ga.-based
PetroSouth.

PetroSouth, which operates about 135 units in Alabama and
Georgia, will rebrand the sites to Citgo or its own brand,
company says.

Sites will be rebranded first quarter 1996.

Buy is part of PetroSouth's goal to grow by at least 50
locations by end of 1996.

Company plans to move into in Florida early 1996.

Meantime, Suwannee Swifty's exit from Alabama is part of
company's plan to focus on core markets, company says.

Company raised eyebrows in Tallahassee, Fla. this month when it
closed three stores overnight.

One store still had help wanted sign in window, while another
had a happy holidays sign on reader board.

Suwannee Swifty says closures were planned.

Company says although it is consolidating now, it expects to
start growing in core markets early in 1996.

Company now operates about 200 stores in South Georgia and
Northern Florida.

ALTERNATE FUELS MAY GET VASTLY CHEAPER COMPETITOR

Engine/heavy equipment giant Caterpillar takes another big
stride in quest to prove its "A-21" naptha/water/surfactant
emulsion as a clean, cheap alternate fuel.

Fuel has made headlines since Caterpillar's announcement last
year of a scientific breakthrough with new fuel, invented by
scientist Rudolph Gunnerman of A-55/Advanced Fuels of Reno,
Nevada.

Fuel is an emulsion of about half water and half petroleum
naptha; large-volume production eventually would cost about 35
cents/gallon ex-tax at refinery gate.

Plus, fuel would get about same mileage as conventional diesel
or gasoline, according to company test results submitted to
Nevada Bureau of Air Quality.

Fuel would require no changes to oil industry distribution
structure and only minor, relatively cheap changes to engines.

Fuel also would save refiners from further costly upgrades to
refineries and eliminate costlier alternate-fuel competitors.

Few details about the fuel have emerged since initial
announcement.

However, Nevada just certified A-21 fuel for use as a clean
alternative fuel, with a ringing endorsement from Gov. Bob
Miller.

Now, Nevada State Energy Office says it's pushing for
demonstration of A-21-fueled power generator at a new alternate-
fuels facility, formerly the nuclear Nevada Test Site.

Still, Caterpillar has yet to register A-21 fuel with EPA or get
it certified by federal Dept. of Energy as an "alternate fuel"
that fleets could use to meet costly Energy Policy Act mandates.

But company officials met with DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary
recently, and a DOE policy office has begun to take a look at
the fuel, we've learned.

Meantime, several demonstration test projects are underway, some
involving stationary engines and some involving motor vehicles.

Test results submitted to state of Nevada for designating A-21
as an "alternate fuel" describe fuel as an emulsion of 52% water
(by weight) and 48% hydrocarbon plus 0.5% hydrocarbon surfactant
holding fuel in stable emulsion.

Fuel could be used in either spark or compression-ignition
engines.

Spokesman for Advanced Fuels, Caterpillar's joint-venture
partner in fuel, says water emulsion keeps engine temperature
down, allowing slower, more complete combustion and much lower
emissions.  Similar principle was used in World War II
airplanes.

A nickel catalyst installed in cylinder, possibly employing a
small nickel plate or a nickel spark plug, might promote
combustion of hydrogen molecules in water-fuel emulsion, or so
theorizes fuel's inventor.

In any case, water vapor is a major component of tailpipe gases,
even if water molecules actually provide little or no energy.

Test results submitted to Nevada Bureau of Air Quality show fuel
passes California's tough Phase 2 emission regs and EPA's tough
new regs for diesel engine emissions.

Assuming fuel passes federal regulatory hurdles, marketing would
initially target diesel fleets, then any fleets in areas
affected by "alternate fuels" mandates.

Fuel would require dedicated tank storage.  In extra-cold areas,
fuel may require some ethanol blending to prevent icing.

If demand grows enough, then shipping from naptha
refiner/blenders via pipeline to terminals would become more
feasible, an Advanced Fuels spokesman says.

TOP CHEMIST, JOBBER: CLEAN ENGINE BEATS ALTERNATE FUEL

Properly-tuned cars with properly-maintained oil and fuel
systems do far more to prevent air pollution than multi-billion-
dollar alternate fuels programs.

That's what University of Denver chemistry professor Don
Stedman, inventor of increasingly-popular "remote sensing
device" (RSD) pollution detector, has been telling EPA for years
(OW 1/2/95, 2/21/94).

But politicians have had more fun beating up on oil companies by
mandating costly alternate-fuel programs, rather than insisting
consumers keep their vehicle systems clean, Stedman says.

About 10% of cars on the road today cause most air pollution,
studies show.

So, detecting those "gross polluters" and then fixing them with
good maintenance would save U.S. consumers and taxpayers
billions of dollars wasted on alternate fuels and oxy-fuels.

California jobber Steve Kludt heartily agrees with Stedman.

That's why Kludt has been trying to get government agencies to
promote good maintenance over alternate fuels.

He's also prodded one local agency to test "Super Tune" oil and
fuel system cleansing additive, a mixture of common, well-known
chemical solvents that he's marketed to fleet accounts for
years.

Kludt agrees that well-tuned vehicles with good maintenance and
regular oil changes don't necessarily need an extra dose of
cleaning solvents to cut air pollution.

But some vehicles do need that extra shot of engine cleanser
from time to time.

Fleet vehicles can even extend oil change intervals, offsetting
cost of the solvent additives, he says.

Unlike goofy fuel-system magnets and other "secret formula"
snake-oils, Super Tune is nothing more than toluene, methyl-
ethyl-ketone, isopropyl alcohol and a lightweight mineral
carrying oil.

Those are well-known, common oil/chemical industry solvents,
Stedman confirms.

While Stedman personally doesn't recommend any sort of
additives, he concedes that perhaps 10% of vehicles may
occasionally need something extra, such as solvents, to remove
pollution-causing dirt from engines.

As Kludt explains, "you cannot properly tune an engine if it has
crankcase and fuel system deposits."

Cleaning those systems, properly tuning vehicle and changing oil
regularly will cut pollution dramatically.

Ironically, auto manufacturers now push 50,000 mile tuneups and
lengthy oil change intervals.  That not only causes pollution,
but could ruin engines.

Planned obsolescence could explain those automaker
recommendations, Kludt says.

Meantime, consumer revolt against costly alternate fuels
continues to grow, as evidenced by more states opting-out of
costly RFG programs and California beginning to back-off
electric-car and natural-gas-car mandates.

So now may be right time for oil industry to propose far-less-
costly alternatives, such as better emissions inspections, tune-
ups for dirty cars and proper oil/fuel system maintenance.

While many automotive aftermarket bottlers target dirty fuel
systems, "nobody thinks about crankcase deposits," Kludt says.

Those deposits can foul PCV valves, which in turn cause tailpipe
pollution.  Proper oil changes, plus a solvent treatment for
especially-dirty cars, could clean up crankcases that cause so
much pollution.

At only about $3.75 per bottle with regular oil changes,
solvents such as Super-Tune could fix pollution problems a lot
cheaper than $40,000 electric cars, $30,000 CNG cars or RFG
gasolines costing 10-25 cents/gal. more than ordinary gasoline,
Kludt maintains.

Kludt also says he hopes to get more jobbers interested in
promoting maintenance over alternate fuels.

10TH CIR.: WILLIAMS BOUND
TO BUY GAS BEYOND 20-YEAR
TERM OF 'TAKE-OR-PAY' PACT

     The 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5 that,
under the terms of a 20-year "take-or-pay" natural gas purchase
contract forged in 1982, Williams Natural Gas Co. is obliged to
continue buying gas beyond the contract period if the plaintiff
sellers do not revise prices or contract terms.  Talus Properties
Limited Partnership et al. v. Williams Natural Gas Co., No. 95-
1056 (10th Cir.).

     Seeking reversal of a U.S. District Court ruling affirming
the validity of the contracts with plaintiffs Yuma County Oil
Co., Talus Properties Limited Partnership and others for natural
gas produced in Yuma County, CO, Williams argued that the
agreements were ambiguous.  Williams said the U.S. District Court
for the District of Colorado erred in rejecting its request to
enter extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent to remedy the
ambiguity.  It also said the trial judge erred in not reaching
its claim in favor of reformation of the agreements.

     In a non-binding order and judgment, the 10th Circuit said
the contracts were clear and unambiguous.  "The primary term of
each of the contracts is twenty years.  Once the primary term
expires, the contract will remain in effect under the same terms
and conditions, unless, during the allotted time periods, the
respective plaintiffs offer to sell the defendant the gas under
different terms and conditions," the panel ruled.  "Because the
relevant provisions are unambiguous, defendant cannot introduce
extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict their terms."

     The panel said Williams' purported extrinsic data is not
permitted because it is not evidence of additional contract
terms.  "Under the plain language of the contracts, defendant
continues to be obligated to purchase gas from plaintiffs after
the expiration of the primary term unless plaintiffs offer
defendant a new price for the gas, which defendant rejects.
Defendant, however, wants to introduce extrinsic evidence that it
contends establishes that defendant has no obligation to purchase
gas from plaintiffs after the expiration of the primary term.
Because the evidence would vary, rather than supplement, the
written terms, it is not admissible under the guise of CO Rev.
Stat. Sec. 4-2-202(b)."

     The 10th Circuit's opinion, by Circuit Judge Deanell Reece
Tacha, said there was no evidence to support Williams' claim that
the contracts should be reformed because of the mutual mistake of
both parties of not including provisions for a drop in natural
gas prices.

     "The provisions at issue originated with defendant and
became part of the final contracts without any discussion by the
parties.  Nothing suggests that plaintiffs failed to consider the
possibility of future declining prices when they executed the
respective contracts," concluded the court.  "To the contrary,
the contracts work to plaintiffs' advantage in a declining
market.  Nor is there any evidence that plaintiffs knew at the
time they executed the contracts that defendant's assent to the
contracts was based on its mistaken belief that future gas prices
would not fall."

DC CIR. VOIDS FERC'S
INTERPRETATION OF 1968
GAS SALE CONTRACT

     The District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Dec. 12 vacated a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order that
said a 1975 gas sale contract between Jack Grynberg and Rocky
Mountain Natural Gas Co. was illegal because the gas sold under
the pact was dedicated to interstate commerce in a 1968 contract
between Grynberg and another interstate pipeline.  Grynberg et
al. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Nos. 94-1699 and 95-
1134 (DC Cir.).

     The court's ruling comes after both Grynberg and Rocky
Mountain challenged the FERC's finding that since the Colorado-
produced gas had been dedicated to interstate commerce, the
maximum lawful price would be lower than the price paid by Rocky
Mountain.  Grynberg contested the FERC's dedication to commerce
ruling, while Rocky Mountain challenged the Commission's refusal
to order Grynberg to refund certain overpayments.

     In an opinion by Judge A. Raymond Randolph, the DC Circuit
said that, even in allowing jurisdictional deference, the FERC's
interpretation of the 1968 agreement between Grynberg and
Mountain Fuel Co. was "not reasonable" because that contract did
not tie future production from those fields to interstate
commerce usage.  The panel remanded the case for further FERC
review without considering Rocky Mountain's petition.

     "The Commission's reading of the contract is entitled to
judicial respect..., but here the Commission has gone beyond a
fair construction to reach a result it has not supported," said
the DC Circuit.  "The Commission viewed the 1968 agreement as
having dedicated all of the gas underlying the fields described
in the contract to Mountain Fuel."  The FERC, said the panel,
improperly derived its finding from an introductory "Whereas"
clause in the beginning of the 1968 contract which states:
"WHEREAS, Seller owns or controls, and desires to sell and Buyer
desires to purchase Seller's share of gas underlying the lands
and leaseholds (subject lands) described in Appendix 'A'...."

     The DC Circuit said the FERC reached its conclusion based on
the introductory clause and "brush[ing] aside" a subsequent part
of the contract (Article II-1) prohibiting application of the
1968 contract to lands adjoining the pertinent wells.  "Ignoring
the rest of the contract, the Commission offers little more than
an assertion to support its idea that the prefatory Whereas
clause defines the scope of the dedication," wrote Judge
Randolph.  "According to the Commission, Grynberg agreed to sell
all of the gas underlying the subject lands to Mountain Fuel.
But if the Whereas clause defines the extent of the obligation to
sell and dedicates all of the gas to Mountain Fuel, what is the
role of Article II-1?"

     Nancy J. Skancke of Grammer, Kissel, Robbins & Skancke
represents Grynberg.  The FERC is represented by Commission
Attorney Jill L. Hall and Solicitor Jerome M. Feit.  John T.
Miller Jr. argued the cause for intervenor Rocky Mountain.  All

5TH CIRCUIT VACATES
APPOINTMENT OF CAJUN
BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE

     Holding that a trial court's appointment of a bankruptcy
trustee for debtor Cajun Electric Cooperative is not in the best
interest of the parties involved, as required under 11 U.S.C.
Sec. 1104(a)(2), a divided Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Nov. 20 vacated the appointment at the request of Cajun and
several of its creditors.  In re Cajun Electric Power
Cooperative, Inc.; Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. v.
Central Louisiana Electric Co., Inc., No. 95-30760 (5th Cir.);
see Utilities Industry LR, July 1995.

     After making a threshold determination that the appointment
of a trustee by a district court sitting in bankruptcy is a final
appealable order, the Fifth Circuit ruled 2-1 that such an
appointment here was wrong because it was based on the trial
court's incorrect assumption that there was a conflict of
interest in the makeup of Cajun's board of directors.

     Cajun chose Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after
sustaining major losses from investments in the ill-fated River
Bend Nuclear Power Facility and then being ordered to lower its
rates by the Louisiana Public Service Commission.  The court
below appointed a bankruptcy trustee for Cajun after board
difficulty by board members in deciding whether to appeal the PSC
order.

     Although the board voted to appeal the rate reduction
ruling, the trial judge said the decision was complicated by the
fact that many Cajun board members were either managers or board
members of Cajun's 12 member companies, all of whom bought power
from Cajun.  A vote to appeal would mean they were attempting to
raise rates for their subsidiary companies; not to appeal would
mean added difficulty for Cajun to pay its debt obligation.  A
trustee was appointed at the request of Rural Utility Service
(RUS), the federal agency from which Cajun received a $1.6
billion loan to invest in River Bend.

     On appeal, the Fifth Circuit majority said that the
appointment of a trustee is an extraordinary remedy under Sec.
1104(a)(1), one for which the moving parties failed to meet their
burden of proof.  The panel said that while the district court
offered several reasons for its decision, they all stemmed from
the inherent conflict between the interests of its member-
customers and those of its creditors.

     "However, because this inherent conflict results from
Cajun's organizational structure " a structure that Congress
encouraged it to adopt " the conflict is insufficient to justify
the appointment of a trustee," said the majority in an opinion by
Judge Reynaldo G. Garza.  "The fact that Congress and the RUS
encouraged " if not required Cajun to organize itself as a
cooperative leads us to believe that any conflict inherently
arising from Cajun's organization as a cooperative is
insufficient to justify the appointment of a trustee."

     "Further," the panel added, "holding that these inherent
conflicts constitute cause for appointing a trustee would create
a per se rule permitting the appointment of a trustee in any case
involving a cooperative."

     Writing in dissent, Judge Emilio M. Garza disagreed with the
majority's per se rule assumption, saying the trustee's
appointment should stand.

     "The conflicts present in this case go beyond the 'inherent'
conflicts under which all healthy cooperatives operate," he said.
"Presumably, healthy cooperatives do not fail to collect monies
owed by member-customers or attempt to deny member-customers
access to information.  Nor do members in healthy cooperatives
consider strategies which seem designed to break-up and scavenge
the assets of the debtor....  Once cooperative members begin
working at cross-purposes, to the extent Cajun's members have,
the appointment of a trustee may be the only effective way to
pursue reorganization."

CONVICTION REVERSED IN
DESTRUCTION OF KY NATURAL
GAS TRANSMISSION TOWER

     A divided Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Nov. 29
reversed the conviction of a defendant who hired people who
mistakenly destroyed an interstate transmission tower owned by a
natural gas company.  United States v. Howard, No. 95-5433
(6th Cir.).

     The 2-1 majority said defendant Ricky Nelson Howard did not
intend to destroy an interstate transmission facility but had
mistakenly targeted the wrong tower.

     Howard, who owned a Kentucky cable television company,
offered to pay a man $1,000 to destroy a tower operated by a
competitor, but mistakenly pointed out a nearby Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp. tower as the target.  That man recruited a
friend to assist.  When Howard refused to pay the $1,000 fee
because the wrong tower had been destroyed, the disgruntled
accomplice contacted the FBI.

     An Eastern District of Kentucky grand jury indicted all
three for conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the destruction
of an interstate facility under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety
Act (NGPSA).  The two men who carried out the destruction pleaded
guilty.  A jury convicted Howard at trial before Judge Joseph M.
Hood.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed in an unpublished, 2-1 per curiam
decision.

     Howard unsuccessfully argued the Columbia Gas tower was a
communication rather than transmission facility and was not a
pipeline facility under NGPSA; it had an electronic system to
convert pipeline pressures and flow rates into electrical signals
and to transmit the results to a central monitoring location.  He
also unsuccessfully argued the tower was exempt from protection
under NGPSA because it was located in a rural area.

     However, the majority said the conviction must be reversed
because the conspirators lacked specific intent to cut down a gas
tower.  As a result, it said a jury could not reasonably conclude
that the defendants knowingly and willfully destroyed a gas
pipeline facility.

     Dissenting, Judge Harry W. Wellford said the mistake as to
ownership of the Columbia Gas tower was insufficient for
reversal.  Howard, in fact, did point out the Columbia Gas tower
to a co-conspirator, he said.

11TH CIR.: GA PRISON
OFFICIALS DUE IMMUNITY IN
POWER CONTRACT BID SUIT

               Although ruling that two low-bidding electric cooperatives
held a state-created property right in electrical service
contracts granted to high-bidder Georgia Power Co. by Georgia's
Department of Corrections (DOC), the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals on Nov. 15 reversed a district court's denial of
qualified immunity for DOC officials and remanded the case for
further state law action.  Flint Electrical Membership Corp. v.
Whitworth et al.; Pataula Electric Membership Corp. v. Whitworth
et al., Nos. 94-9199 and 94-9227 (11th Cir.).

     The court's action came in the consolidated treatment of
separate lawsuits by Flint Electrical Membership Corp. and
Pataula Electric Membership Corp. (the EMCs), which claimed they
were denied their due process rights to supply power to certain
DOC facilities when DOC violated Georgia's State Purchasing Act
and awarded the contracts to Georgia Power.

     U.S. District Judge Horace T. Ward of the Northern District
of Georgia originally dismissed the actions on the pleadings for
failure to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, holding that
the EMCs had no federally protected property interest in the
contracts.  The 11th Circuit, in an earlier ruling, reversed
Judge Ward on the grounds that Georgia law requires electrical
service contracts to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder
"whenever possible."

     Holding that DOC officials should have known the are
required to follow competitive bidding procedures, the 11th
Circuit remanded the case to trial court, where DOC and Georgia
Power, also a defendant, moved for summary judgment.  Upon the
court's denial of all such motions, the DOC officials appealed to
the 11th Circuit.

     In a per curiam opinion, the panel found that although the
EMC's right to a property interest in the contracts remain, the
DOC defendants are now entitled to qualified immunity due to a
change in the law under the 11th Circuit's 1994 ruling in
McKinney v. Pate.  In that case, the 11th Circuit held that Sec.
1983 substantive due process claims arising from nonlegislative
deprivations of state-created property interests are no longer
cognizable in the circuit.

     The panel noted that the EMCs should have, but did not, file
suit against DOC in state court under Georgia law O.C.G.A. Sec.
50-5-79, designed to challenge the issuance of improperly bid
state contracts.  "Because they failed to do so, and because the
rule of law announced in McKinney must be applied
retroactively..., their Sec. 1983 due process claims are not
actionable," the court concluded.

DEMAND EXCUSED BY MAJORITY
HOLDER'S INFLUENCE ON
BOARD MEMBER, SAYS DE CT.

     A shareholder plaintiff was excused from making pre-suit
demand on the board of York Research Corp. by a Delaware state
court judge who on Dec. 4 found that a majority of the board
lacked independence due to a dominant director/shareholder's
ability to exert "considerable influence" over a swing vote
director.  Friedman v. Beningson et al., No. 12232 (DE Ch. Ct.).

     In his memorandum opinion, Chancellor William T. Allen
rejected a motion to dismiss breach of duty and insider trading
charges from Delaware Chancery Court, finding that in order to
allege lack of independence, it was not necessary to show that
the swing vote director's continued employment and remuneration
hinged solely on the whim of the controlling director.

     At issue in the derivative suit by Irving Friedman was the
decision of York Research Corp. " a Delaware company that
develops, constructs and operates co-generation power plants " to
issue interest-free loans to several of its directors and
officers so that they could buy large blocks of stock in the
company.  According to the complaint, the directors and officers
then made false statements regarding revenue growth and future
business prospects to inflate York's stock price and sold their
shares before announcing that revenues would be significantly
below projections.

     Friedman alleged that the defendant officers and directors
not only misused corporate office but cost the company a $500,000
settlement used to obtain the dismissal of shareholder securities
suits in federal court in New York City.

     After the suit was amended, defendants in July 1993 moved to
dismiss it for failure to make demand on the board before
initiating the action.  Friedman contended that he was excused
from making pre-suit demand because the majority of the three
board members lacked both independence and disinterest.  He said
defendant York director/president Robert Beningson was the
mastermind of the interest-free loan and insider trading scheme
and that he exerted a controlling interest over board member John
Ellis through his control of his remuneration.

     The court said it need only address the first prong of the
two-prong test used in Aronson v. Lewis, DE Sup. 473 A.2d 805, 8
(1984), i.e., whether plaintiff has alleged particularized facts
creating a reasonable doubt whether those directors could, under
the circumstances, exercise a judgment on the suit and demand
that would qualify for the deference of the business judgment
rule.

     "This inquiry may include the subject whether some or all
directors are 'beholden' to or under the control, domination or
strong influence of a party with a material financial interest in
the transaction under attack, which interest is adverse to that
of the corporation," the court wrote.  "Such circumstances alone
may sometimes raise a reasonable doubt that directors in such a
situation could exercise judgment on behalf of the corporation
concerning the transaction involving such dominant or influential
party."

     The court noted that the state Supreme Court held in Rales
v. Blasband, DE Sup. 634 A.2d 927, 936, that "although the
director/officer's continued employment and remuneration did not
hinge solely on his relations with the defendant directors, the
official authority of the defendant directors 'placed them in a
position to exert considerable influence over the director
officer.'"  Ellis's continued receipt of consulting fees,
"...when considered in the context of the other facts alleged,
represents a substantial interest subject to possible corporate
retribution had he exercised judgment in a way displeasing to the
financially interested shareholder/CEO," the court concluded.

     The court also noted that Beningson's ties to York's
principal client empower him in relation to the other directors,
"...since they must remain cognizant of and sensitive to his
ability to affect York's business prospects."  The chancellor
also noted (1) the size of the loans " the loan to Beningson was
greater than the company's net revenue that year; and (2) York's
settlement of the federal class actions without any director
contribution, despite the profits earned by Beningson.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Joseph Rosenthal and John Day
of Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess in Wilmington; and Ronald

CA CT. GRANTS JUDGMENT
FOR DEFENSE IN OFFICE
EMF EXPOSURE CASE

     Holding that the plaintiffs would be unable to submit causal
evidence associating electromagnetic field exposure to the
development of cancer in humans, a California Superior Court
judge on Dec. 8 granted defendant Southern California Edison's
(SCE) motion for summary judgment in a suit by office workers who
say they developed cancer due to the location of an SCE
transformer beneath their office.  Johsz et al. v. Koll Co. et
al., No. 726765 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.); see Utilities
Industry LR, October 1995.

     Orange County Superior Court Judge H. Warren Siegel said he
agreed with SCE's assertion that plaintiffs' proffered testimony
would not meet the Kelly-Frye admissibility test as laid out in
the California Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in People v. Kelly.
Such testimony, which was to have been given at trial beginning
this month, he said, failed to conclusively say EMFs caused
plaintiff's cancers.  The testimony expected from plaintiffs'
experts Samuel Milham, M.D., M.P.H., and David Michael Ozonoff,
M.D., suggested only that "there is a causal association; that
based on statistics it 'may' be a cause," the judge ruled.

     The judge added, "Statistics may lend credence to an opinion
that EMF caused plaintiff's cancers, but there is no expert
opinion that it did in these cases and Ozonoff and Milham are the
only causation experts proposed by the plaintiffs on the EMF
issue."

     Co-defendants Koll Co. and Grubb & Ellis joined in the
utility's summary judgment motion.

     Plaintiffs Michael and Jill Johsz, James and Christianne
Nichols, and Mary Ann Stewart voluntarily withdrew their causes
of action for battery and fraudulent concealment and their
request for punitive damages after SCE moved for summary judgment
on Nov. 7.  Plaintiff attorney Annee Della Donna, who plans to
file a motion for a new trial this month, says the ruling does
not affect companion cases Younkin v. Southern California Edison
(see Utilities Industry LR, September 1995, P. 11,032), in which
a March settlement conference is slated, or Muir v. Southern
California Edison (see Utilities Industry LR, June 1995), which
is scheduled for trial on May 20, 1996.

     The plaintiffs discounted SCE's summary judgment motion
claim that the Kelly-Frye test is inapplicable, arguing that it
applies only to admissibility of "new scientific methods, devices
or techniques" in criminal cases.  Instead, they said that their
conclusions and opinions should be judged, and are shown
reliable, under the 35-year-old "Hill Criteria," developed in
England.  The Hill Criteria, they argued, include strength,
consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient,
plausibility, coherence, experiment and analogy.

     "Plaintiffs argue that the Kelly-Frye rule is not applicable
to the scientific principle of whether EMF causes cancer, but
rather is limited to novel scientific techniques, methods or
tests," SCE responded.  "In support of this argument, plaintiffs
cite several California decisions which have held that the Kelly-
Frye rule is not applicable to medical opinion testimony based on
an examination of a particular physical or psychological injury."

     "However," the utility continued, "the cases cited by
plaintiffs on this point are inapposite in that the issue with
respect to Edison's motion for summary judgment is not the
admissibility of medical opinion testimony that EMF caused
plaintiffs' specific cancers, but rather the admissibility of
scientific evidence on the threshold issue of whether EMF causes
cancer generally.  This distinction is highlighted by the fact
that the expert declarations submitted to plaintiffs in
opposition to Edison's motion for summary judgment do not
indicate that either of the declarants have ever examined any of
the plaintiffs in this action, but rather base their opinions
solely upon scientific literature and epidemiologic studies
regarding the health effects of EMF."

     Opposing SCE's motion, the plaintiffs challenged the
qualifications of defense experts Philip Cole, M.D., Chairman of
the University of Alabama School of Public Health's Department of
Epidemiology; and Jack D. Sahl, M.S., M.P.H., Ph.D, an SCE
research scientist since 1983.  Both men, the plaintiffs argued,
"are so tied to the utility companies that their testimony is not
credible."

     SCE replied, "in contrast to the declaration of Dr. Cole
[that there is no causal relationship between human cancer
development and EMF exposure], the declarations submitted by
plaintiffs are devoid of any reference to general acceptance
within the scientific community of the principle that EMF causes
cancer.  Rather than addressing the consensus of the scientific
community, Dr. Milham simply states that there are a number of
biological mechanisms by which EMF 'may' cause cancer, that EMF
'may' affect and compromise the immune system, and that, in his
opinion, EMF exposure promotes a number of cancers."

CA COURT VOIDS FRAUD,
CONDEMNATION, NUISANCE
CLAIMS AGAINST TANC

     A California Superior Court judge ruled Nov. 21 that the
plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proving that the
Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) committed fraud
in refusing to disclose the potential dangers of electromagnetic
fields when it acquired a 200-foot-wide right-of-way across their
100-acre farm in 1991.  Jess et al. v. Transmission Agency of
Northern California et al., No. V-0072568 (CA Super. Ct., Alameda
Cty.); see Utilities Industry LR, Feb. 15, 1994.

     Judge Richard A. Hodge said that although TANC had a duty to
inform John Jess Jr. and his wife, Nell Jess, of the "existence
of a public controversy" concerning the effects of EMF on human
health, TANC did not defraud the couple when TANC right-of-way
agent Robert Gray negotiated a deal to purchase the 11.4-acre
strip of land for $80,960.  Claims for reasonably foreseeable
health hazards resulting from the placement of the 500kV
transmission line, the court added, are moot under a waiver
contained in the right-of-way contract.

     The fraud, inverse condemnation and nuisance suit charged
TANC with failure to reveal that the operation of the line at
full capacity would result in a 1 milligauss (mG) EMF or more
over an area of up to 600 feet from the center of the
transmission line.  The complainants said there was a diminution
of the value of their property as a result of the EMF and that
there was an interference with their use and enjoyment of their
property.

     Weighing the testimony of opposing property appraisers,
Judge Hodge said the estimated valuation drop suggested by
claimants' appraiser Arthur Gimmy was inconclusive because it
failed to differentiate between the loss attributed to EMF fear
and that due to the general installation of a high voltage line
across a rural property.

     "The court...was not persuaded that Mr. Gimmy had adequately
distinguished loss of value from perceived health problems from
loss of value attributed to the manifold negatives otherwise
associated with transmission lines," Judge Hodge wrote.  "In this
regard, it is important to observe that the plaintiffs negotiated
their easement and right-of-way contracts with full appreciation
of the visual, aural, and 'convenience' negatives.  Presumably,
the plaintiffs calculated these negatives in their acceptance of
the $80,960 contract price."

     The court ruled, "The fact that EMF MAY engender biological
effects of unknown consequence is not sufficient to establish a
basis for damages.  Plaintiffs' proof of actual harm derived from
asserted biological effects of EMF has been singularly lacking in
persuasive force."

     Judge Hodge concluded, "Plaintiffs have failed to meet their
burden of proof to establish fraud, inverse condemnation or
nuisance.  Plaintiffs have failed to establish any damages.
There is no established nexus between EMF exposure and any known
health hazard.  While a diminution in property value may be
expected from the proximity to EMF transmission lines, here
plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate any diminution in
value attributable specifically  to the fear of health hazards as
opposed to other of the known detriments.  Plaintiffs negotiated
and accepted a price for the easement which accurately reflected
the damage to their property."

     TANC is represented by Ivor E. Samson of Sonnenschein Nath &
Rosenthal and by Valerie Smith Boyd of Marron, Reid & Sheehy,
both of San Francisco.  The plaintiffs are represented by Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. and John J. Keating of the Law Office of John

9TH CIR. DETERMINES HEALTH
ASSESSMENT TO CONSTITUTE
REMOVAL OR RESPONSE

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 affirmed a
Washington federal court's dismissal of a citizens' group's bid
to compel the Agency for Toxic Research and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) to initiate a health assessment program in the region of
the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.  Hanford Downwinders Coalition
et al. v. Dowdle et al., No. 94-35100 (9th Cir.).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.)

     The panel agreed that no federal court jurisdiction existed
over the claim and concluded that the ATSDR's ongoing health
assessment activity in the region constituted a removal or
remedial action for the purposes of CERCLA's Timing of Review
provision.

     The litigation stems from ongoing cleanup efforts at the
Hanford facility in Richland, WA, which for some 30 years
produced plutonium for the Department of Defense.  The facility
generated releases of radioactive iodine and other hazardous
substances into the atmosphere, soil and water of the region.

     In 1988, the EPA proposed adding the Hanford site to the
National Priorities List (NPL).  The following year, the EPA,
Department of Energy and Washington Department of Ecology
outlined their response.  The ATSDR was assigned specific
responsibilities under the response plan to prepare preliminary
health assessments, and was given the discretion to expand them
to full health assessments if warranted.

     The Hanford site has remained the subject of continued
research by the ATSDR.  In 1993, the ATSDR declared the site to
be among the Superfund sites posing the greatest threat to public
health, and has applied the results of the Centers for Disease
Control's 1994 study to its criteria for determining whether
medical monitoring would be appropriate.

     Plaintiffs Hanford Downwinders Coalition Inc. (HDC) brought
the instant litigation in July 1993, alleging that the ATSDR has
a mandatory duty under CERCLA Sec. 9604(i)(9) to commence a
health surveillance program in the region, including medical
testing and monitoring for individuals exposed to radioactive
iodine.  The Eastern District of Washington granted the defense's
dismissal motion, concluding that the ATSDR's health-related
activities at Hanford constituted ongoing removal or response
activity, and that the plaintiffs' claim was therefore an
impermissible challenge.

     Affirming, the Ninth Circuit first rejected the plaintiffs'
contentions that the language of the statute supported their
construction of the statute.  The HDC asserted that when Congress
instructed the ATSDR to "effectuate and implement [CERCLA's]
health-related authorities" in Sec. 9604(i)(1) of the statute, it
meant to distinguish these health-related authorities from
"response authorities" as defined under Sec. 9604.  "There is no
indication that Congress' characterization of ATSDR authorities
as 'health related' was intended to render the Sec. 9604
'response authorities' section superfluous as to ATSDR actions,"
the panel rejoined.

     The panel found that the language of Sec. 9604(i)(1) "should
be read narrowly as a means to distinguish between different
types of response authorities, rather than interpreted broadly as
an effort to differentiate ATSDR health assessment and
surveillance activity from response actions protected by the
Timing of Review provision."

     Cautioning that not all Sec. 9604 "response authorities" are
to be considered removal or remedial actions per se, the Ninth
Circuit engaged in an analysis of whether the ATSDR's conduct
could be shown to be removal or remedial activity.  "The ATSDR
health assessment and surveillance activities challenged by the
HDC," the panel wrote, "are a necessary part of the government's
efforts to safeguard the public health at NPL sites....  [The
ATDSR] is an integral part of Congress' effort to protect the
health of those exposed to hazardous releases from facilities
listed on the NPL."

     The court reconciled the instant case with its holdings in
Durfey v. E.I. DuPont (1995) and Price v. U.S. Navy (1994), which
declared that independent private actions for medical monitoring
were not removal or remedial actions.  "The reasoning in Durfey
and Price does not apply to health assessment and surveillance
actions engaged in by a governmental agency pursuant to explicit
CERCLA provisions," wrote the panel.

     The plaintiffs pointed to the structure of CERCLA, noting
that Sec. 9607(a)(4)(A), which provides for the government to
recover "all costs of removal or remedial action," is separate
from Sec. 9607(a)(4)(D), which provides for the recovery of "the
costs of any health assessment" made by the ATSDR.  The panel
rejoined that Sec. 9607(a)(4)(D) was in fact part of the 1986
SARA amendments, and "decline[d] to read the failure of Congress
to accomplish the seamless integration of ATSDR provisions with
the other authorities found under subsection 9607(a)(4)(A) as
compelling proof of Congress' intent to distinguish ATSDR
activities from removal and remedial actions."

     The plaintiffs also pointed to the separate treatment of
response costs and ATSDR costs in CERCLA Sec. Sec. 9611(a) and
9611(c).  Noting the fact that the legislative history was silent
as to why the distinction was made, the panel stated its
obligation "to choose the interpretation that is most consistent
with the remainder of the Act."

     Having established that the ATSDR's conduct constituted
removal or remedial action, the Ninth Circuit disposed of HDC's
assertions that the requirements of the Timing of Review
provision were otherwise unsatisfied.  The panel looked to its
1995 holdings in MESS v. Perry and Razore v. Tulalip Tribes in
concluding that the HDC's suit was a "challenge" to the ongoing
removal or remediation.

     Tom H. Foulds, Seattle, represents the appellants.

     Elizabeth Ann Peterson of the U.S. Department of Justice,
Environment and Natural Resources Division, Washington, DC,
represents the appellees.

9TH CIR. ASKED TO DECIDE
NGA AND 'HINSHAW' STATUS
OF MOJAVE'S CA EXPANSION

     In an intervenor's brief filed Dec. 18, Process Gas
Consumers Group (PGCG) told the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals to reject the California Public Utilities Commission's
petition to vacate two Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
orders asserting regulatory authority over Mojave Pipeline Co.'s
planned 400-mile-plus "Northward Expansion" gas transmission line
from Sycamore, CA to the San Francisco Bay area.  Public
Utilities Commission of the State of California v. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, No. 95-70611 (9th Cir.); see related
story, Pacific Gas & Electric v. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, Utilities Industry LR, June 1995.

     PGCG sided with Mojave's Dec. 13 intervenor brief, which
urged the court to affirm FERC authority over the project based
on the FERC's finding that Mojave will neither be (1) engaged in
local gas distribution and subject to state jurisdiction under
Natural Gas Act (NGA) Sec. 717(b); nor (2) under PUC rule through
the NGA's "Hinshaw Amendment" exemption.

     In November, the PUC asked the Ninth Circuit to vacate the
FERC orders (No. 61,194, Feb. 15, 1994; No. 61,167, Aug. 4, 1995)
that rendered void a 1993 PUC order asserting PUC jurisdiction
over the high-pressure line.  The FERC said it holds authority
over the line because it is designed to provide direct
transportation-only service to end-users, not local distribution
retail sales.

     The PUC, however, says the project meets the criteria for
Hinshaw Amendment exemption from NGA rule, which are that,
"(1) the person or facilities must either transport or be legally
authorized to transport gas which is 'received by such person
from another person within or at the boundary of a State';
(2) 'all the natural gas so received [must be] consumed within
such State'; and (3) 'the rates and services of such person and
facilities [must] be subject to regulation by a State
commission.'"

     The PUC argued that "[i]f Mojave's Northward Expansion
application were granted, both Mojave " the 'person' " and the
'facilities' used by Mojave to transport gas received by Mojave
in California and ultimately consumed in California, would be
exempted from FERC jurisdiction by the plain language of the
Hinshaw Amendment.  The FERC is therefore, without jurisdiction
to grant the expansion certificate requested by Mojave.  Such a
certificate can only be granted by the PUC, which has certified
to the FERC that 'it has regulatory jurisdiction over the rates
and services of the Mojave Pipeline Co. and the facilities used
by Mojave to transport gas received by Mojave in California and
ultimately consumed in California and that it is exercising such
jurisdiction.'"

     On Nov. 14, a joint intervening brief was filed on the PUC's
behalf by Associated Gas Distributors (AGD), the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Toward Utility
Rate Normalization, a consumer action agency that says
residential and small business customers have experienced
significant rate hikes in recent years due to interstate pipeline
bypass.

     AGD and the joint intervenors say the record "amply
demonstrates that Mojave's Northward Expansion project will
engage in the local distribution of natural gas and is therefore
exempt from FERC regulation."  The FERC's assertion of authority,
they add, is "inconsistent with the statutory language,
legislative history, and case law of Sec. 1(b)."

     The PGCG added on the FERC's behalf, "The proposed
facilities are not Hinshaw facilities exempt from the NGA.
Mojave's pipeline crosses the Arizona-California border,
and...Mojave's integrated pipeline transports gas as part of a
continuous stream of interstate commerce.  The fact that some gas
might potentially also be received from Kern River [Gas
Transmission Co.] in California does not change the interstate
character of the transportation.  In order to qualify as a
Hinshaw pipeline, a pipeline must operate exclusively in one
state; Mojave does not.  The mere existence of an extension or
branch located within a state does not render an integrated
interstate pipeline company a Hinshaw pipeline.  Nor would
receipt of gas from another interstate pipeline within the state
alter the multi-state pipeline's interstate character."

     The PUC brief was filed by PUC attorneys Mark Fogelman,
Peter Arth Jr. and Edward W. O'Neill of San Francisco.  Mojave is
represented by corporate attorney Michael D. Ferguson of
Bakersfield, CA, and by Mary Anne Mason, Kenneth L. Wiseman, and
Kenneth M. Minesinger of Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., in Washington,
DC.

     The AGD intervenor brief was filed by Frederick Moring and
Ann H. Kim of Crowell & Moring in Washington, DC.  PGCG is
represented by Edward J. Grenier Jr., William H. Penniman, Glen
S. Howard and Daniel E. Frank of Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan.
All are located in Washington, DC.

CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT
AFFIRMS $1.3M WRONGFUL
DEMOTION AWARD

     A company that demoted two employees without following the
procedures outlined in its personnel manual was ordered to pay
$1.3 million in damages to those workers by the California
Supreme Court on Nov. 13.  Scott et al. v. Pacific Gas and
Electric, No. S042601 (CA Sup. Ct.); see Utilities Industry LR,
April 19, 1994.

     In a unanimous decision on an issue of first impression, the
court said that there was no reason why an employer's policy that
its employees not be demoted except for good cause could not
become an implied term of an employment contract.

     Plaintiffs C. Byron Scott and Al Johnson were engineers with
defendant Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)'s technical and
ecological services unit when they were demoted in 1988.  Just
prior to the demotion, PG&E's internal auditing department began
an investigation into Scott's and Johnson's supervisory practices
and outside business interests.  According to court documents,
both men were partners in an outside consulting firm, and PG&E
had been informed of this involvement from the outset.

     As a result of the investigation, Scott and Johnson were
accused of being negligent supervisors and of resolving against
PG&E any conflicts of interest that arose from their dual
positions as proprietors of an outside business and employees of
PG&E.  They were suspended with only a brief explanation of the
charges against them and were denied copies of the report.  Their
response to the report was submitted in three days, and contained
extensive documentary support for their denials that they favored
vendors or employees of their outside business while employed by
PG&E.

     Scott and Johnson filed suit, claiming that PG&E breached an
implied contract term not to demote employees without good cause.
Their theory was based on the company's detailed personnel
policies, and there was evidence at trial that PG&E intended to
bind itself to those disciplinary policies.  There was also
testimony that neither Scott nor Johnson had shown any
favoritism.

     The jury found in favor of the employees and awarded them
$1.325 million in economic damages and $75,000 each for emotional
distress.  A divided state Court of Appeal reversed, finding a
contract action for "wrongful demotion" inherently vague.  The
court also concluded that judicial involvement in employment
decisions short of termination would constitute an unacceptable
intrusion into the employer-employee relationship.

     The California high court reversed, agreeing with the
plaintiffs' argument that their breach of an implied-in-fact
agreement with PG&E not to be demoted without good cause is
substantially similar to an action for breach of an implied-in-
fact contract not to be discharged without good cause.  The
latter cause of action was held to be enforceable in Foley v.
Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654 (1988), noted Justice
Stanley Mosk, who delivered the opinion of the court.

     The principle that implied contract terms may arise from an
employer's official and unofficial policies and practices is one
that pre-dates Foley, and has not been confined to the area of
wrongful termination, said Justice Mosk.  Where an employer
promises to confer a significant benefit on an employee " such as
a promise to restrict termination or provide for severance pay "
it is a question of fact whether that promise was reasonably
understood by the employee to create a contractual obligation,
said the court.  Here the jury resolved that issue in favor of
Scott and Johnson.

     Turning to the evidence of an implied contract adduced in
the instant case, Justice Mosk concluded that that evidence was
"not merely substantial, but compelling."  He cited the company
detailed "positive discipline" and testimony from PG&E's own
human resources managers to support the jury's conclusion that
there was an implied contract, and that its terms were not too
vague to enforce.

     Scott and Johnson are represented by Christopher Platten of
Wylie, McBride, Jesinger, Sure & Platten in San Jose.  Counsel
for PG&E is corporate attorney Maureen Fries in San Francisco.

PLAINTIFF IN ILL HEALTH
SEEKS EXPEDITED APPEAL
OF CA DEFENSE VERDICT

     The plaintiff in a personal injury suit against the owners
and operators of the St. Onofre Nuclear Generating Station
(SONGS) will petition the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
this week for an expedited appeal of a jury verdict in favor of
the defense after losing a bid for a retrial on Dec. 5, according
to his attorney, Don Howarth.   James v. Southern California
Edison Co., No. 94-1085 (SD CA).

     Howarth filed a notice of appeal on Dec. 22.  He said that
his client, Glen James, 63, who is suffering from chronic
myelogenous leukemia, is in rapidly deteriorating health and that
he wants to expedite the appeal on James' behalf "while it may
still do him some good."  James, an engineer, worked at SONGS in
the mid-1980s.

     Howarth moved for a new trial after the eight-person jury
returned a verdict in favor of defendants Southern California
Edison and Combustion Engineering Inc. on Oct. 12.  He argued
that the jury was improperly influenced by the O.J. Simpson trial
and by juror misconduct.

     Howarth argued that the verdict was against the weight of
the evidence, that it was the product of improper passion and
prejudice and that the jury improperly considered extraneous,
prejudicial information.

     According to the motion, one of the jurors, Genevieve
Fitzwater, told the others that she had received radiation
therapy for thyroid cancer and that "it had saved my life."  In
addition, after the jurors were allowed to watch the verdict in
the O.J. Simpson case, Fitzwater also allegedly told the others
that they must apply the same "reasonable doubt" standard used in
the Simpson murder case to the evidence in this case.

     James also alleged that a second juror told a post-verdict
gathering that he had made his mind up for the defense early in
the trial before all of the evidence had been presented and that
he had never wavered in his belief.

     Southern District of California Judge Napoleon Jones Jr.
rejected all of those arguments, finding that under the Federal
Rules of Evidence, most of juror Gregory Hafen's declaration
supporting the allegations of juror misconduct is inadmissible.

     According to Rule 606(b), a juror may not testify to
anything that may have influenced his decision during
deliberations except on the question of whether extraneous
prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's
attention.

     Under that rule, only Fitzwater's statements about her
radiation treatment and applying the reasonable doubt standard
may be admissible if they can be shown to be extraneous
information and prejudicial by a preponderance of the evidence,
Judge Jones said.

     He ruled, however, that Fitzwater's alleged statements about
her radiation treatment are not prejudicial extraneous
information but "are best classified as personal experience
applied to the evidence in the case...."

     Citing to Hard v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., 870 F.2d
61 (9th Cir. 1989), Judge Jones said, "The type of after-acquired
information that potentially taints a jury verdict should be
carefully distinguished from the general knowledge, opinions,
feelings and bias that every juror carries into the jury room."

     In Hard, he said, the Ninth Circuit found that it is
acceptable for a juror to use his own personal experience to
interpret the evidence in a case.  In addition, even if
Fitzwater's statements did constitute impermissible extraneous
information, the plaintiff failed to show prejudice by a
preponderance of the evidence.

     On the reasonable doubt issue, Judge Jones found that such
allegations are not admissible because they constitute testimony
on the mental processes of the jury.  He found no Ninth Circuit
precedence on the issue, but he cited two Fifth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals cases that hold that once a verdict is rendered,
the court may not inquire into the jury's deliberative process to
determine if the jury properly followed the court's instructions
(United States v. D'Angelo, 598 F.2d 1002 [1979] and Robles v.
Exxon Corp., 862 F.2d 1201 [1989]).

     In addition to Howarth, the Jameses are represented by
Suzelle M. Smith of Howarth & Smith in Los Angeles.  Southern
California Edison is represented by Jack Reding of Crosby,
Heafey, Roach & May in Oakland, CA.

CA SUP. CT. TO DECIDE
MOBILE HOME SUBMETER
SYSTEMS RATE DISPUTE

     A consortium of California mobilehome park owners on Sept.
12 asked the California Supreme Court to decide if the state
Public Utilities Commission misinterpreted the public utilities
code in barring park owners from recovering the unreimbursed
costs of operating their submeter utility systems.  Western
Mobilehome Parkowners Association et al. v. Public Utilities
Commission of the State of California, No. S048893 (CA Sup. Ct.).

     Western Mobilehome Parkowners Association (WMA) sought the
court's review after the PUC refused WMA's motion to rehear the
issue in August (Decision Nos. 95-02-090 and 95-08-056).  The
group, whose members operate 5,780 master-meter/submeter electric
and gas distribution systems, says they have been disadvantaged
by the PUC's refusal to let them recover, via rent increases,
system operation costs above the discounted rate provided by
their local utility.

     WMA says that since Public Utility Code Sec. 739.5(a) does
not expressly prohibit parkowners from recovering unreimbursed
costs, the PUC has overstepped its authority and has illegally
engaged in rent control by forcing them to make up the difference
out of their pockets.  The PUC issued the ruling after mobilehome
park residents complained they were, in some cases, being double-
billed for park system maintenance costs, once in the rates they
paid and again in landlord-imposed rent increases.

     The Supreme Court petition maintains that since the
implementation of Sec. 729.5(a), the submetering discount
provided parkowners "has been set based on utility comparable
costs which have been determined to be substantially lower than
the reasonable costs of master-metered mobilehome park owners of
providing submetered service."  It adds that "the PSC in D.95-02-
090 has now decided that as between owners of mobilehome parks
and residents in mobilehome parks, mobilehome park owners must
underwrite all those reimbursed costs, that is losses incurred in
owning, operating and maintaining submetered systems, WITHOUT ANY
RECOURSE."

     In an Oct. 16 answering brief, the PUC says the issue was
appropriately decided because Sec. 739.5 bars subsystem operators
from recovery of costs above the submetering discount.  The PUC
says the legislative intent of the section was not to allow full
compensation for subsystem operations, but to give a "sufficient
differential to cover the reasonable average costs to master-
meter customers of providing submeter service."

     "Moreover," the PUC added, "the regulation may serve a
legitimate public purpose in preventing the potential for the
double recovery of costs by park owner.  The double recovery may
exist if the leases provide for rents that include the capital
costs related to the submetered system, and these same costs are
factored into the discount received by the park owner, and the
tenants do not receive a credit.  Thus, this double recovery
would be a windfall for the park owner.  The elimination of such
a windfall is a legitimate public interest."

     WMA is represented by Richard L. Hamilton and James E. Young
of the Law Office of Richard L. Hamilton in Sacramento.  The
answer was filed by PUC attorneys Peter Arth Jr. and Helen W. Yee
of San Francisco.

DC CIR. REVERSES FERC'S
APPROVAL OF 'BLENDED RATE'
FOR MICHCON GAS SERVICE

     Siding with an ANR Pipeline Co. petition that alleged the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission arbitrarily and capriciously
allowed Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. (MichCon) to employ a
"blended rate" schedule for natural gas transport services, the
District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 12
reversed the FERC ruling and remanded it for further review.  ANR
Pipeline Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, No. 94-1705
(DC Cir.).

     ANR asked the court to review the FERC's decision,
complaining that it violated the Commission's own anti-rate
blending edict in Order No. 636.  In that order, the FERC
mandated use of a straight fixed-variable (SFV) rate plan for
intrastate or "Hinshaw" pipelines operating in cooperation with
interstate lines under Sec. 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of
1978 (NGPA).

     The panel noted that ANR opposed MichCon's use of blended
rates as an intervenor in FERC proceedings and that the
Commission approved the rate plan despite ANR's insistence that
the approach would provide MichCon the anticompetitive ability to
provide a discount in its rates under Michigan law, which is
unavailable to federally ruled interstate lines.

     "The reasons given by FERC fail to explain why MichCon's
blended rates would not present the ills that FERC concluded in
Order No. 636 would result from continued authority to blend
rates," said the DC Circuit in an opinion written by Judge Judith
W. Rogers.  On remand, said the panel, the FERC must address
ANR's concerns about MichCon's use of blended rates and
"...provide a reasonable justification for excluding MichCon from
the SFV requirements, in view of FERC's conclusions about rate
blending and about the necessity of the SFV rate method to
promoting congressional directives for a natural gas market."

     The court added that the FERC "missed the point" when it
answered ANR's rate-blending concerns by holding that ANR and
other interstate pipelines can remain competitive by discounting
their rates.  "A pipeline that cannot blend rates is unable to
recover fixed costs foregone as a result of discounting its
demand charges.  Conversely, a pipeline with the ability to blend
rates can recover such fixed costs by shifting them from the
demand charge to the usage charge."

     Daniel F. Collins, G. Mark Cook and Christine R. Pembroke of
The Coastal Corp. represent ANR.  The FERC is represented by
Commission Attorney Katherine Waldbauer, Solicitor Jerome M.
Feit, and Deputy Solicitor Joseph S. Davies.  All are located in

CA SUP. CT. ASKED TO
REVIEW REQUEST FOR
GAS CONTRACT DATA

     The California Supreme Court has been asked by two utility
consortiums to issue a writ of mandate compelling the state
Public Utilities Commission to open its files on four Southern
California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) natural gas transmission contracts
for inspection under the provisions of the California Public
Records Act.  Southern California Utility Power Pool et al. v.
Public Utilities Commission of the State of California; Southern
California Gas Co., real party in interest, No. S049667 (CA
Sup. Ct.).
               Southern California Utility Power Pool (SCUPP) and Imperial
Irrigation District (IID) comprise publicly owned utilities that
say the PUC violated the public access provision of Sec. 6250-65
when it denied their access requests as contrary to the public
interest.  The PUC conceded that while California Public Utility
Code Sec. 489 charges utilities with the responsibility of filing
and keeping "open to public inspection," rate schedules and
contracts that affect rates, SCUPP and IID, as potential SoCalGas
competitors, are not entitled to view the unredacted contracts.

     Allowing the petitioners access to the proprietary
information on rates charged by SoCalGas under the agreements,
said the PUC, would be unfair because neither SCUPP nor IID are
under PUC regulation, thus denying SoCalGas any opportunity of
requesting inspection of their transmission agreements.  Each of
the pacts at issue was approved under the PUC's "Expedited
Application Docket" (EAD) process, which allows transmission
companies to provide discounts for customers threatening to
"bypass" the utility for another power source.

     The PUC's reciprocity argument, says SCUPP/IID, is
"misplaced" because "neither the members of SCUPP nor IID compete
with SoCalGas to provide gas transmission service.  They operate
publicly owned electric utility systems that consume gas to
generate electricity for their retail electric customers."  SCUPP
includes the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the
cities of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena.

     The petitioners told the Supreme Court that the PUC denied
the request despite the fact that it knew the contracts were not
eligible for exemption from public inspection under the Act.
"For an agency to properly apply the law that it is empowered to
enforce, it must first look to the language of the statute to
determine if it is clear.  If the language is clear, the agency
must apply that language," argued SCUPP and IID.  "It is not
within the discretion of the agency to rewrite the provisions of
the relevant statute to fit its goals.  Any actions that are
inconsistent with the clear pronouncement of the legislature must
be overturned."

     In a Dec. 1 answer, the PUC said its actions were warranted
under Public Records Act Sec. 6255, which holds that "the agency
shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the
record in question is exempt under express provisions of this
chapter or that on the facts of the particular case the public
interest served by not making the record public clearly outweighs
the public interest served by disclosure of the record."

     The PUC contended that "SCUPP/IID can ignore Commission
orders to disclose records while demanding (as it does here) that
the Commission order SoCalGas to disclose the very same type of
document.  The legislature did not intend to create unfair
competition.  That is exactly what will happen under SCUPP/IID's
version of the law in this case in that SoCalGas would be placed
in an unfair competitive position in negotiations with SCUPP/IID
and other entities if disclosure of its similar gas contracts is
required.  On these facts, the conclusion that non-disclosure
outweighs disclosure was lawful."

     On Nov. 21, SoCalGas, as real party in interest, filed a
Supreme Court brief opposing the writ petition.  It said the PUC
properly based its denial of the contract access requests on the
increasingly competitive California natural gas market.  "The
Commission's EAD decision noted that in light of the imminent
threat of bypass of historic public utility facilities (two major
new interstate pipelines have commenced service in California
since 1990, providing service to customers previously served by
SoCalGas), the Commission determined to prevent public disclosure
of the information in arrangements which could be detrimental to
the competitive position of the public utility company and its
remaining ratepayers during the period such bypass threats
continue.

     SoCalGas says the Records Act, based on the federal Freedom
of Information Act, "was enacted with the clear intent to exempt
from disclosure those documents on file with the government
which, if made available, would result in business disadvantage
to a company vis-a-vis its competition."  SCUPP and IID's
discussion of the Act, it adds, "fails to comment specifically on
the long-standing exception to disclosure for BOTH corporate
trade secrets and commercial information likely to cause
competitive harm."

     The petitioners are represented by Norman A. Pederson and
Kirstin Porter-Whitley of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Los
Angeles.  The PUC is represented by agency attorneys Peter Arth
Jr., William N. Foley and Lawrence Q. Garcia of San Francisco.
The SoCalGas response was filed by corporate attorneys Daniel G.
Clement and Norman J. Provost.  All are located in Los Angeles.

NC COURT OF APPEALS
DENIES EASEMENT FOR
UTILITY INSTALLATION

     An easement that does not expressly permit access for
utilities cannot be judicially expanded to authorize installation
of underground utility and telephone lines, the North Carolina
Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 21 in a 2-1 decision.  Swaim v.
Simpson et al., No. COA94-1205 (NC Ct. App.).

     The majority said the easement holder is bound by the
express and limited language of the conveyance.

     Rickey Swaim was granted a recorded easement to his
residential lot for a "right of way for ingress and egress" over
a lot owned by Elmer and Joan Simpson in Yadkin County, NC.
After the Simpsons refused him permission to install underground
utility and phone lines along the easement, Swaim filed a
declaratory judgment complaint in Yadkin County District Court,
where Judge Samuel L. Osborne granted summary judgment in favor
of Swaim.

     The Court of Appeals reversed in a majority opinion by Chief
Judge Gerald Arnold.  Once an easement is established, the
easement holder cannot change the use for which it was created in
a way that increases the burden on the subservient land, said the
panel.  Allowing the location, installation and maintenance of
facilities for domestic utilities on the Simpsons' property would
increase that burden, it said, and the easement cannot be
judicially expanded.

     Dissenting, Judge Clifton E. Johnson said Swaim's
underground utilities would not encumber the Simpsons' property
or use of the easement.  He also said it is reasonable to
interpret the easement language as including the right to install
utilities to a residential lot.

     C.R. "Skip" Long Jr. of Morrow, Alexander, Tash & Long
represented the Simpsons.  N. Lawrence Hudspeth III and Douglas
P. Mayo of Shore Hudspeth & Harding appeared for Swaim.

CONSEQUENCES OF FEDERAL UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT
(DSM) LEGISLATION TO UTILITIES

This (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) paper
reviews some of the potential consequences of recent
federal legislation on Demand-Side Management (DSM) to
utilities.  It covers the 1992 Energy Policy Act
(EPAct), the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, and
FERC Order No. 636.  The paper: outlines the contents
of the federal legislation regarding utility DSM
programs; explains some of the impacts of these laws
and regulations on utility programs, particularly the
likely effects with respect to the emerging competitive
utility market; and seeks to understand where and how
action will be needed to carry out many of the
provisions of these laws in the most cost-effective
manner.

Examples of specific activities regarding DSM in
Pennsylvania are included for illustration.  Each of
the federal laws under discussion is unique in terms of
origin, goals, and focus; nevertheless they all focus
on the regulated energy industries in such a way that
their effects tend to combine to force massive changes.
In the regulated electric and natural gas industries,
this synergy is compounding the complexity of
management and, at least in the short term,
contributing to increases in the cost of doing
business.  In the long term, these federal initiatives
are likely to lead to a massive reassessment of
state-regulated energy sources in production and end
use, and their environmental consequences.  The overall
effect of all three pieces of legislation is to
increase competition among the state-regulated
utilities.  The differences between competitive and
regulated industries are also noted in an effort to
explain the effect of inducing competition among energy
utilities.  This has particular relevance to
utility-sponsored energy-efficiency programs such as
DSM, and other customer-assistance activities.

UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS: 1989 THROUGH
1998

Over the pest five years, the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) has been collecting data annually
from U.S. electric utilities on their Demand-Side
Management (DSM) programs, both current and projected.
The latest data, presented in this (Oak Ridge National
Laboratory) report, cover activities for 1993 and
projections for 1994 and 1998.

In 1993, 991 utilities operated DSM programs and spent
$2.8 billion, a 13% increase over 1992 expenditures.
These and earlier DSM programs saved 44,000 GWh of
energy and reduced potential peak demand by 40,000 MW,
30% and 22% increases over the 1992 values,
respectively.  While some people predict the demise of
electric-utility DSM programs, the data do not paint as
bleak a picture.  In most parts of the country, DSM
programs grew in 1993, and utilities (as of Spring
1994) projected continued growth through 1998.
Expenditures grew from 1.3% of revenues in 1992 to 1.5%
in 1993, and are expected to grow 2.5% per year faster
than inflation.  Thus, DSM spending is expected to stay
constant at 1.5% of revenues through 1998.

Because of the cumulative effect of DSM programs,
energy savings are expected to grow from 1.2% of sales
in 1992 to 1.6% in 1993 and 3.0% in 1998.  Potential
peak reductions are expected to increase from 5 9% of
peak demand in 1992 to 6.8% in 1993 and 8.9% in 1998;
however this growth in spending is not as rapid as the
8% annual real growth projected a year earlier. Actual
expenditures in 1993 were 6.5% lower than projected
early that year; while energy savings were the same as
projected earlier.  Potential peak reductions were
actually 9% higher than previously projected.

IMPACT EVALUATION OF UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT
(DSM) PROGRAMS

Over the past several years, four of the largest
investor-owned California utilities have completed more
than 50 evaluation studies designed to measure the
energy and demand impacts of their Demand-Side
Management (DSM) programs.  The four utilities are:
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California
Edison (SCE), Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), and
San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E).  These studies
cover residential, commercial, industrial, and
agricultural DSM programs and provide a wealth of
information on program impacts.

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report summarizes
the results of these DSM evaluation studies in order to
describe what DSM has achieved in California.  It
assesses how well these achievements were forecast and
compares the effectiveness of the different types of
DSM programs.  It also documents the sizable
investments made by the California utilities in their
1990-1992 DSM programs.  Between 1990 and 1992, the
four utilities spent $772 million on energy-efficiency
and energy-conservation programs.  The report
summarizes the realization rates estimated by the
50+ evaluation studies.  Realization rates -- defined
as ex-post net savings estimates divided by ex-ante net
savings estimates -- are summarized for 158 programs
and program segments.

IMPACTS OF ELECTRIC UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT
(DSM) PROGRAMS ON ELECTRICITY PRICE

As competition in the electricity industry increases,
utilities (and others) worry more about the upward
pressure on electricity prices that Demand-Side
Management (DSM) programs often impose.  Because of
these concerns, several utilities have recently reduced
the scope of their DSM programs, or have focused them
more on customer service and peak-demand reductions and
less on improving energy efficiency.

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) study uses ORFIN
(the Oak Ridge Financial Model) to calculate the rate
impacts of DSM.  ORFIN is used to examine the two
factors that contribute to DSM's upward pressure on
prices: (1) the cost of the programs themselves; and
(2) the loss of revenue associated with fixed-cost
recovery.  The second factor reflects the reduction in
revenues caused by the DSM-induced energy and demand
savings that exceed the reduction in utility costs.

The analysis examines DSM price impacts as functions of
the following factors: (1) the DSM program itself,
including: cost; conservation load factor; geographic
focus on deferral of transmission and distribution
investments; and mix across customer classes; (2) the
utility's cost and pricing structures, which include
factors at least partly under the utility's control,
such as: retail tariffs; fixed vs. variable operating
costs; and capital costs not related to kW or kWh
growth; and (3) external economic and regulatory
factors, including: the level and temporal pattern of
avoided energy and capacity costs; rate-basing vs.
expensing of DSM-program costs; shareholder incentives
for DSM programs; load growth; and the rates for
income, property, and revenue taxes.

STUDY OF NET LOSS REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS FOR UTILITY
DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT (DSM) PROGRAMS

Utility shareholders can lose money on Demand-Side
Management (DSM) investments between rate cases.
Several industry analysts argue that the revenues lost
from utility DSM programs are an important financial
disincentive to utility DSM investment.  A key utility
regulatory reform undertaken since 1989 allows
utilities to recover the lost revenues incurred through
successful operation of DSM programs.  Explicitly
defined net lost revenue adjustment (NLRA) mechanisms
are the states' preferred approach to lost-revenue
recovery from DSM programs.

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report examines
the experiences that states and utilities are having
with the NLRA approach.  The report: determines whether
NLRA is a feasible and successful approach to removing
the cost-revenue disincentive to utility operation of
DSM programs; identifies the conditions linked to
successful implementation of NLRA mechanisms in
different states; assesses whether NLRA has changed
utility investment behavior; suggests improvements to
NLRA mechanisms; identifies states having NLRA
mechanisms where utilities are recovering cost revenues
from DSM programs, through interviews of regulatory
agency staffs in these states and utility staffs in
four states; analyzes regulatory agency orders
involving NLRA, as well as associated testimony,
reports, and utility lost revenue recovery filings; and
uses qualitative and quantitative indicators to assess
NLRA's effectiveness. Contrary to the concerns raised
by some industry analysts, the results indicate that
NLRA is a feasible approach to the lost-revenue
disincentive.

A SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT MODEL FOR STUDYING THE
DEMOGRAPHIC IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE UTILITY RATE DESIGNS

Historically, utility customers have been
differentiated into various customer classes based on
their utility service demand characteristics.  This
(Argonne National Laboratory) paper argues that greater
differentiation based on value and cost of service can
be justified on grounds of economic efficiency, and if
done properly, can also promote economic equity.  Doing
this would require a break with traditional customer
classifications.  With this break, more detailed
information on how and why certain utility services are
consumed would be required.

In line with the issue of heterogeneity within the
residential customer class, is the differential impact
that different utility rates might have on different
population groups.  The paper shows how differences in
the pattern of energy use may give rise to disparate
economic impacts, depending on the rate structure, and
how more equitable and efficient outcomes might be
achieved if these differences are taken into account.
For this purpose, an analytical model has been
developed.  The Energy Policy Socioeconomic Impact
Model (EPSIM) is an econometric simulation model to
assess the economic impact of utility rate designs and
Demand-Side Management programs on various population
groups.  The paper provides a conceptual description of
the theoretical underpinnings associated with the
EPSIM.

ELECTRIC AND GAS RATES FOR RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND
INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN 1994 FOR 45 U.S. CITIES

This 2-volume report (by Casazza, Schultz and
Associates) contains electric and gas rates for the
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors in
45 U.S. cities during 1994.  The rates were collected
from the utilities that serve the 45 cities involved in
the study.  These rates apply to the residential,
commercial, and industrial sectors of service and
include both general service and various innovative
rate structures.  The information compiled from the
utilities is compared to data from other sources to
ensure consistency.  Additional contacts were made with
specific utilities to resolve observed conflicts of
information.  The information is organized in several
lengthy appendixes (A, B, and C in Volume 1, and D, E,
F, and G in Volume 2) with introductory explanatory
chapters in Volume 1.  Appendixes D and E provide rate
abstracts for the South and West regions; Appendix F
provides a list of known utility rate revisions; and
Appendix G provides 1994 utility sales data.

STUDY OF THE EXTENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE
PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY

This (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) study
focuses on technological change in electricity
production.  The study is based on empirical economic
research on production functions in the electric
utility industry.  It advances a seldom used approach,
called the engineering-production function, instead of
the more common neoclassical approach used by
economists.  Combined with this approach is a major
departure from the type of data used to conduct
econometric estimations of production parameters.  The
research draws upon a consistent set of ex-ante or
blueprint data that better reflects planned technical
performance and cost data elements, in contrast to the
more customary expect-type of data from actual firm
and/or plant operations.  The results from the
examination of coal-fired technologies indicate the
presence of technical change.  Using data for the
period 1979 to 1989, it finds technical change to be
capital-augmenting at the rate of 1.8% per year.

ELECTRIC UTILITIES' ROLE IN BUILDING THE NATIONAL
INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE (NII)

In two particular aspects, from a lawyer's perspective,
that are briefly investigated in this (DOE) study ,
electric utilities appear uniquely well-positioned to
contribute to the National Information Infrastructure
(NII).

One aspect concerns the legal powers that utilities
have derived from their charters and operating
authorities and confirmed in their rights-of-way, to
carry out activities and functions necessary for
delivering electric service.  These activities and
functions include building telecommunications
facilities and undertaking information services that
are essential to manage electricity demand and supply.
The economic value, to utilities and society, from the
efficiencies made possible by telecommunications and
information could be substantial.  How great remains to
be established, but by many estimates, electric utility
applications could fund a significant share of the
capital costs of building the NII.  Although utilities'
legal powers to pursue such efficiencies through
telecommunications and information appear beyond
dispute, it is likely that effort to do so will produce
substantial excess capacity.  Who will benefit from
this excess capacity is a potentially contentious
political question that demands early resolution.  Will
this windfall go to the utility, the customer, or no
one because of political paralysis, or will there be
some equitable and practical split.

A second aspect, one of inquiry, points to another
contemporary issue of very great societal importance
that could very well become the platform on which the
first question can be resolved fortuitously: how to
achieve universal telecommunications service.  In the
effort to fashion the NII that will now continue, ways
and means to maximize the unique potential contribution
of electric utilities to meet important social and
economic needs -- in particular, universal service --
merit priority attention.

THE WHEELING OF COGENERATED POWER

This (Engineering Research and Consulting Inc.) report
concerns project considerations and design systems for
the wheeling of cogenerated power.  The term "wheeling
electric power" refers to utility transmission of power
that it doesn't own.  The term "cogeneration" refers to
simultaneous production of electric and thermal power
from an energy source that, in many instances, is more
efficient and less expensive than separate production

ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELD LEVELS FROM HIGH-VOLTAGE
TRANSMISSION LINES VERSUS THEIR DESIGN OPTIONS AND COST

This (Argonne National Laboratory) report provides
background information regarding electric and magnetic
fields (EMFs) of high-voltage transmission lines at
typical voltages and line configurations and typical
transmission line design-option costs, to assist with
alternatives for environmental control of field
strengths.  EMF strengths up to 200 ft from a
transmission-conductor centerline are calculated for:
an ac overhead line; a 345-kV and a 230-kV ac
underground line; and a (+ or -)450-kV dc overhead
line.  Compacting and height sensitivity factors are
computed for variation in EMFs when the line conductors
are moved closer or raised.  Estimated costs for the
lines are presented and discussed, so that the impact
of using alternative strategies for reducing EMF
strengths, and the implications of implementing the
strategies, can be better appreciated.

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY FOR ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS

This (NREL) report presents a program overview of
superconductivity for use in electric power systems.
Largely due to government and private industry
partnerships, electric power applications based upon
high-temperature superconductivity are now being
designed and tested, only 7 years after the discovery
of high-temperature superconductors.  These
applications offer many benefits to the national
electric system, including: increased energy
efficiency; reduced equipment size; reduced emissions;
increased stability/reliability; deferred expansion;
and flexible electricity dispatch/load management.  All
of these benefits have a common outcome: lower
electricity costs and improved environmental quality.
The DOE sponsors research and development through its
Superconductivity Program for Electric Power Systems,
which will help develop the technology needed for U.S.
industries to commercialize high-temperature
superconductive electric power applications.  The DOE
envisions that by the year 2010, the U.S. electric
power systems equipment industry will regain a major
share of the global market by offering superconducting
products that outperform the competition.

CONCERNS REGARDING ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY
IN COMPETITIVE POWER MARKETS

For years the electric utility industry operated as a
regulated monopoly, largely immune to market forces
except those of competing fuels.  That era came to an
end with the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act
(PURPA) of 1974, which created a market for non-utility
generated power. Within 20 years, non-regulated
non-utility generators have become the primary supplier
of new energy resources.  Their market power is matched
by their political power, as evidenced in the Energy
Policy Act of 1994 (EPAct) that requires open access to
utility transmission lines to facilitate inter-utility
bulk power sales.

Conventional wisdom regarding this issue believes that
active wholesale power markets with competition among
alternative generators will lead to lower
power-development costs and cheaper retail power
prices.  However, the trend towards alternative bulk
power sources at low prices intersects with large
retail power customers' interests in accessing
alternative power supplies.  In many instances, these
alternatives to local utilities are at a lower cost
than retail rates.

For the most part, proponents of generation competition
have remained silent about potential environmental
consequences.  However, skeptics of increased
competition, including some major environmental groups,
cite environmental impacts among their concerns.  This
(Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) paper deals
with energy and environmental efficiency in competitive
power markets, and examines these concerns.

ELECTRICITY REGULATION IN GERMANY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
EUROPEAN MARKET

This translation from Germany (Oldenburg University)
concerns electricity regulation in Germany in the
context of the European Market.  It presents a survey
of the electric power regulatory thinking and situation
in Germany with respect to ongoing European Market
reform.  Electric utilities in Germany are semi-public
or private enterprises having a wide variety of size.
The large producer-utilities operate the high voltage
grid on the basis of private contracts.  Regional
distribution companies, mostly without a considerable
share in production and often in cooperation with local
distributors, deliver electricity in the non-urban
areas; whereas mostly city-owned electric utilities
supply the large cities, often with a considerable
share of electricity produced in cogeneration plants.
In the past, the equilibrium between the parts of this
system was ensured by a legal framework that protected
local monopolies, as well as by long-term contracts
between producers and distributors.  This equilibrium
derived its stability from political, more then
economic, factors.

Now, deregulation trends inherent in European Market
legislation on competition threaten this stability.  In
the first phase of this legislation, resistance against
a more competitive order seemed unanimous.  Since that
time, however, the different players have had time to
rethink their positionS.  The European Council has now
proposed a more moderate regulation, taking into
account the large differences among the different
member countries.  The German Government has made a
proposal for some important changes in the European
Market Energy Law and connected passages in the
Competition Law, which would introduce some
more-competitive elements into the system.  Wholesale
producers and regional distributors, as well as
customer groups, are in favor of this reform, whereas
the local distributors fear they will become the losers
in the ongoing reform process.  Environmentalists
express concern that a more competitive order could
lead to a lowering of environmental standards.

HOW A SMALL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP HELPED REFORM ELECTRIC
UTILITY REGULATION

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) paper tells a
story about David and Goliaths; how a small
environmental group helped reform electric utility
regulation.  In 1991, the Land and Water Fund of the
Rockies (LAW Fund) -- a regional environmental
organization -- started an energy project with two
lawyers and a scientist to challenge the
energy-efficiency, renewable-resource, and
environmental-protection practices of utilities in the
vast six-state Rocky Mountain region.  Within three
years, Colorado and Utah had adopted comprehensive
Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) rules, and several
utilities had developed plans to expand their
Demand-Side Management (DSM) activities.  The paper
discusses the role that this small band of lawyers and
policy analysts played in stimulating these changes.
It also comments on the substantial influence and
valuable services that such a small group can provide.

DIRECT CONVERSION OF METHANE TO METHANOL

This (University of Colorado) report covers a program
to demonstrate the effectiveness of a catalytic
membrane reactor (a ceramic membrane combined with a
catalyst) to solely produce methanol by partial
oxidation of methane.  Methanol synthesis and
separation in one step would make methane more valuable
for producing chemicals and fuels.  Both ceramic and
metal membranes are tested, and similar results are
obtained.  A cooling tube is inserted inside the
membrane reactor to create a low-temperature zone that
rapidly quenches the product stream.  This
non-isothermal non-permselective membrane reactor has
proved effective for increasing methanol selectivity
during CH4 oxidation.

THE NET ENERGY BALANCE OF CORN ETHANOL

Studies conducted since the late 1970s have estimated
the net energy value of corn ethanol; however,
variations in the data and assumptions used among the
studies have resulted in a wide range of estimates.
This (Economic Research Service) study identifies the
factors causing this wide variation and develops a more
consistent estimate.  It concludes that the net energy
value of corn ethanol has become positive in recent
years due to technological advances in ethanol
conversion and increased efficiency in farm production.
It shows that corn ethanol is energy efficient, as
indicated by an energy ration of 1.24.

WEST AFRICAN DEEP WATER DRILLING SET TO TAKE OFF END YEAR

A new market for high specification semi-submersibles opens up in deep
water off West Africa at the end of this year.  Suitable drilling units
will need to be brought in from outside the region to cope with water
depths varying from 2,500 to over 4,000 feet.

Co-operation is likely between the operators planning to drill during
1995/6 to reduce mobilisation costs and avoid undue competition within
the small worldwide pool of suitable rigs.  This will probably limit
the number of deep water rigs required offshore Nigeria to two - one an
upgraded third generation or standard fourth generation unit operating
in intermediate water depths of around 2,500 ft, and the other a
specialist deep water rig capable of drilling in 4,000 ft or more.

There are also deep water drilling programmes planned elsewhere
offshore West Africa, notably in Angola, but also in Congo, Gabon
Equatorial Guinea and potentially Namibia.  These could provide
continuing employment for one other deep water unit. The DP drillship
Pelerin has begun to establish a foothold in this segment of the
market.

Pelerin moved from South East Asia last year to drill two deep water
wells for Elf in the Congo, although the contract was terminated after
a single well.  However, after modifications in Cape Town, Pelerin will
drill two deep water wells for Shell in Block 16 in Angola starting in
May.

The critical players in the Nigerian deep water semi market are Shell
and Statoil, the latter operating on behalf of the Statoil/BP
consortium.  Statoil and Shell are due to drill up to six wells apiece
in the period 1995 to 1997, amounting to approximately six months
drilling by each company per year.

Initially, the two operators investigated combining their programmes,
and sharing a suitable rig.  A pre-tender was issued late last year for
a semi for a one year term starting at the end of 1994, with two
further one year options. Partly as a result of this pre-tender the
incompatibility of the two programmes in terms of rig specification and
timing became clear.

Both operators require semis equipped with 15,000 psi BOP stacks for
programmes starting early in 1995.  Shell plans three wells in over
2,500 ft of water and one in over 4,000 ft.  Two of these are planned
to be drilled from the first quarter of 1995.  After a four month gap
to early 1996, a further two wells will be drilled.  Shell is then
considering two further deep water wells in 1997.  In contrast five of
six wells planned by Statoil are understood to be in around 2,500 ft of
water, while one well in deeper water is being deferred until 1997.

For its programmes in 1995 and 1996, Statoil is believed to consider an
upgraded third generation semi to be suitable, whereas Shell will need
a more specialised fourth generation deep water rig.  Having
established the mutual incompatibility of their
programmes, the two operators are now seeking alternative partners to
fill the gaps in their requirement with a single rig contract.  Shell is
talking to Esso which is planning a well in over 3,250 ft of water in
the third quarter of 1995, and could, with minor adjustment, neatly fill
the gap between Shell's 1995 and 1996 programmes.

Statoil is understood to have circulated other operators with the
results of its joint pre-tender exercise with The Norwegian state
company is expected to tender by early April for a semi to start work
at the end of 1994.  As well as attempting to set up a partnership with
one or more other operators, it is thought Statoil could base its
contract on anything from one to six firm wells plus options.

Other operators in Nigeria
Other operators planning deep water wells offshore Nigeria from the end
of 1994 have already begun their own market inquiries.  This month Agip
has sought details of availability and indicative rates for a semi for
one firm well plus two options starting between December 1994 and
February 1995 based on one of two possible scenarios.  Option A is
based on a water depth of 3,600 ft and Option B on a maximum depth of
2,650 ft.  In both cases a 15,000 psi BOP, three mud pumps and
chain/wire mooring with propulsion assist form the basis of the
requirement.  In terms of start date Agip's plans appear to clash with
both Statoil and Shell, so some compromise may need to be worked with
one or the other depending whether Agip goes for Option A or B.

Among others planning deep water wells off Nigeria, Dupont has a
location in about 2,700 ft of water, although the spud is not now
expected until late in 1995.  Elf could also drill in 1995, although it
has indicated it might be 1996 before it drills on its acreage in
permits OPL 222 and OPL 223 where the water depth ranges from 3,000 to
6,000 ft.  Mobil has yet to formulate definite plans for its deep water
Nigerian acreage, but has indicated it intends to work with other
operators to ensure it has access to a suitable rig at the appropriate
time.

Angolan deep water market
Apart from its two wells this year with the drillship Pelerin, Shell
also plans three more deep water wells in Angola Block 16 starting in
mid-1995.  While it is not yet definite that the Pelerin will be
retained for this work, Shell does have options on the rig.  Subject to
successfully concluding its initial two well programme with Shell, the
Pelerin should be well placed to win a further contract with Elf which
is planning a well in Angola Block 17 in 3,300 ft of water spudding in
August or September 1994.  Also in Angola, BP is operator on Block 15
for a consortium including Statoil and Exxon where deep water drilling
will be required, although details of the start date are not yet known.

Congo, Gabon, Namibia and Equatorial Guinea
Elsewhere in West Africa exploration is gradually moving into deeper
water off the edge of the continental shelf.  In Congo, Elf has already
drilled a deep water well in 1994 and could return in the next year or
two to drill deep water well Moho-1. This had previously been planned
for a 1994 spud.  In Gabon, British Gas could drill a well in 1995 in
around 1800 ft of water, while Shell is planning a well in similar
depths on its Kenguerie Marin permit in mid-1996.

UMIC/Mobil is understood to be planning a well in 1700 ft of water
offshore Equatorial Guinea at the end of 1994.  Some acreage in the
recently licensed Namibian offshore also includes deep water territory.
 Norsk Hydro's block is in water depths up to 6,000 ft, but although
consideration has been given to drilling a well in around 3,000 ft of
water, this prospect now appears to have been dropped in favour of
concentrating on more accessible prospects.

OFFSHORE RIG TOP DRIVE SURVEY

Use of top drives in Americas below world average.

The Gulf of Mexico lags behind the rest of the world in the fitting of
top drives or power swivels on offshore rigs.  The top end of the jack-
up market in the US Gulf is well supplied with top drives, as would be
expected in an area with so much development drilling.  This is not the
case for the lower specification units.  However, recent increased
competition, with many rigs mobilising to the area last year, should
result in a rise in the number of top drives fitted.

Experience in the North Sea has shown that while there may well be an
initial dayrate premium gained by rigs with top drive, this disappears
as top drive installation becomes a necessity in order to remain in the
market.  All the competitive jack-ups and all the marketed semi-
submersibles in the North Sea are equipped with top drive.

Just under 52 % of the competitive offshore rig fleet is now equipped
with a top drive or power swivel.  64 % of semis in the world have top
drives, largely reflecting operator preference in the North Sea, where
many semis are still based.  Only 49 % of jack-ups worldwide have top
drives, reflecting the lower percentage of rigs so equipped in the
major jack-up market, the US Gulf, and in other parts of the Americas.

In India top drives are not an ONGC requirement, so statistically there
are a below average number of top drives in the Middle East/India
region.  Top drives are, however, widely used in the Middle East Gulf,
and to a slightly lesser extent in the Gulf of Suez.

Only three drillships have top drives, just 16 % of the world fleet,
principally because drillships are mostly involved in exploratory
rather development drilling.  Of the three which are fitted, Canmar has
two, and Sonat has one on the Discoverer 534.

Rigs with a higher initial capital cost and/or of a more sophisticated
design tend to be fitted with top drive. (see table p 3)  70 % of
deeper water jack-ups and 86 semis are equipped with top drive or a power
swivel.  Many older rigs are not marketed, and upgrades are not
contemplated, so the percentage of marketed rigs with top drive or a
power swivel .  Many older rigs with top drives amongst 1st and 2nd
generation semis and shallower water jack-ups is higher than it appears
statistically.

The provision of top drives and power swivels is dominated by Varco,
which has supplied 215 or 83 % of the top drives to the offshore mobile
competitive rig fleet.  Maritime Hydraulics is having increased success,
and to date has supplied 11 % of the units to the mobile fleet.
Portable top drives have been developed
by both companies.  National Oilwell and ACB,  the market.

A comparison of the investment which drilling contractors have made in
fitting top drives to offshore rigs is interesting.  Seven of the major
contractors (managing over 80 % of their rigs equipped with top drives.
 This figure would be increased to eight., if Global Marine had not
recently purchased three 116 jack-ups which arees.  Although the Gulf
of Mexico has, on average, a lower proportion of top drives compared
with the rest of the world, several of these contractors have the bulk
of their fleet in the US Gulf.

The figures for top drives fitted by contractors is revealing about
contractor status in the largest jack-up market in the world: the US
Gulf.  Three types of controse with over 50% of their rigs equipped
with top drives: Diamond, Dual, ENSCO, Global Marine, and Rowan.  Those
that have a few of their rigs so equipped: Chiles (although that rig is
currently in West Africa,) Marine Drilling, and Noble; and those with
no top drives yet fitted: Falcon Drilling, NR Marine and Southwestern.
Competition will ensure that more top drives are bought.

Explanation of definitions used in top drive tables
The accompanying tables (in the hard copy) on pages 5 to 13, and also
on page 3, give a 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th generation description for each
semi-submersible.  Many rigs, however, have been upgraded to have some
of the characteristics of the next generation of units; the earlier
Sedco 700 series being a particular case in point.  However, some
subjective demarcatioon of a generation to a semi-submersible has been
made more on build date than on physical characteristics.

Jack-ups in India have been grouped with those in the Middle East,
whereas drillships in India have been grouped with those in Asia,
reflecting the way the market for these two types of rigs tends to
function.

NORTH SEA SEMI DEMAND TUMBLES

As expected there has been a dramatic drop in the utilisation levels of
semi-submersibles in the North Sea.  In January there were 34 semis
working in NW Europe.  This is expected to drop to 22 or 23 in the next
month.  With the large exodus out of the North Sea at the end of last
year, demand elsewhere in the world for North Sea semi-submersibles has
for the foreseeable future mostly been satisfied.  There are few
opportunities for contractors now, and lay up for most is a
probability.

For the surplus North Sea semis there may be work for one in the
Mediterranean for Repsol off Egypt, and two deepwater units will be
required in West Africa at the end of the year.  Competition for these
will be strong, with the West African deepwater tenders likely to be
bid also by contractors with rigs in the Americas.  However, of the
North Sea semis, West Delta is mobilising to the Far East for a one
well plus two options contract with Mobil Indonesia in 1,800 ft of
water.  On previously awarded contracts Dan Baroness is substituting
for Dan Countess for Unocal Trinidad, with Dan Princess now mobilising
to LASMO Vietnam, leaving the older Dan Countess stacked in UK.  The
jack-up market in NW Europe has fairly low utilisation levels
anticipated for the rest of 1994, but demand is at least expected to
stay constant.

MEDITERRANEAN MARKET POSSIBLY NOW IN BALANCE

In the Mediterranean a potential shortage of a jack-up in the area has
probably been solved by Santa Fe which plans to mobilise Key Hawaii for
a 2 well plus option contract with Samedan offshore Tunisia.  Key
Hawaii is currently working for Mobil Nigeria, but NNPC payment
problems have made it difficult for Mobil to confirm a definite
extension of a proposed contract.

There are longer term tenders in the Mediterranean area, notably with
TPAO in the Sea of Marmara and Agip Italy where the results are as yet
undetermined.  Sonny Voss is a candidate for mobilising through the
Suez Canal, if the rig is awarded work in the Mediterranean.  INA's
jack-up Labin, based in the Mediterranean, was refused work in Tunisia
at the turn of the year as a protest against political events in former
Yugoslavia.  Whether this will extend to other Muslim countries remains
to be seen, but in such a small market, currently just nine jackups,
this could be of importance.

The award of QGPC's term programme off Qatar will affect rig contracts
in the Gulf of Suez, and possibly the Mediterranean.  QGPC tenders were
lodged at the end of December, and the operator is nearing a decision,
but has not yet awarded the work.  Santa Fe has offered a rig to QGPC,
and is apparently in competition with Maersk for the contract.  If
Santa Fe is successful it will have to mobilise a rig from outside the
Arabian Gulf, probably from the Gulf of Suez or Singapore.

GULF OF MEXICO JACK-UP MARKET FUTURE UNCLEAR

The Gulf of Mexico jack-up market, apart from the Far East and West
African floater markets, now remains the only one in the world where
utilisation in 1994 might be reasonable.  As current natural gas prices
are still well over the $2/mmbtu level, as are the futures prices, the
prognosis is good.  Confidence has not fully returned to the market
after the optimism shown at the end of 1993 before the oil price drop.
Plans being formulated at the moment by many of the operators will be
critical for the market.  A survey of operators' intentions was
intended earlier in the year for this issue of World Rig Forecast, but
in the event, many plans were not firm enough to make a comprehensive
survey worth publishing.

With the large number of mobilisations into the Gulf of Mexico in 1993,
and the heavy refurbishment programme of previously stacked units,
there must remain a doubt about utilisation levels of jack-ups in 1994.
 The top end of the market is showing continuing strength with high
specification units being extended at end 1993 rates.  Those wishing to
re-enter the market after lay-up are having to cut rates.

CHRISTOPHER CREEK, SONOMA COUNTY--LARRY WALKER LIKES THEIR TWO REDS;
CO-OWNER SUSAN MITCHELL SUGGESTS FOOD PAIRINGS;  THEIR CHARDONNAY,
WHICH WALKER ALSO LIKES, IS AVAILABLE ONLY AT WINERY: 707/433-2001

  If Rhone-style wines go out of favor in the USA, most producers of
syrah, mourvedre, carignane and the like can go back to blending those
rich wines into their other reds.

  But tiny Christopher Creek Winery, just south of Healdsburg, has bet
the farm they bought almost ten years ago on petite sirah and the true
Rhone, syrah, both of which win them numerous medals and much praise.
Except for an acre or so of chardonnay, which is distributed mostly from
the winery, their land is devoted to the two reds.

  Larry Walker recently tasted the wines and recorded co-owner Susan
Mitchell's food suggestions, in the California Visitors Review, a great
weekly magazine, $40 per year from PO Box 92, El Verano, CA 95433, tel.
707/938-3494, fax 938-3674 (they don't have e-mail yet, I guess).

    -- The 1991 syrah, $14, brought forth from Walker's quill "lush;
rich;  dark velvety fruit;  full;  layered."  Susan Mitchell, mother of
the teen-age Christopher for whom the winery is named, says hearty
cassoulet is a great match.

    -- The 1992 syrah, also $14, is big and powerful, Walker says-- but
because of tasty fruit, there's a certain graceful quality about it as
well.  So Ms. Mitchell suggests "a chicken and turkey meatloaf with
garlic mashed potatoes and a green salad."

    -- The 1992 petite sirah runs true to its varietal character --
deeply intense, lots of flavor including a full-flavored finish, and
what Walker calls "meaty tannins" which must mean you can pair it with
some hard-knuckled, hot-tempered foods:  sure enough, here's Ms.
Mitchell suggesting pepperoni pizza!  Maybe next year it'll be perfect
with the grilled steak, prime rib or roast pork loin she also mentioned.

    -- There's a 1994 chardonnay whose oak makes its statement from
"behind" a citrus character.  The wine is "elegant, stylish, poised and
balanced," says Walker, mentioning a winery price of $16.  Food?
Grilled chicken or light pasta dishes.

  If you contact Christopher Creek, ask for their recipes matched to
their wines.  Here's one.

SUSAN'S WINTER POTATO SOUP

      1/4 cup olive oil
        1 medium yellow onion, chopped
        4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
    2-1/2 lbs Yukon gold or red potatoes
        3 cups chicken stock
    Also, freshly-ground pepper and salt to taste
      and sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped, or fresh Italian parsley,
            finely chopped.

  Saute onions and garlic one to two minutes in heated oil.  Use a
large, heavy pan.  Don't peel potatoes, but wash and cube them and add
them, with the chicken stock, to the pan;  add water as necessary to
cover the potatoes.  Simmer over heat until potatoes are tender, about
20 minutes.  You can serve from the pot, or puree after allowing the
soup to cool a bit.  Use the tomatoes or parsley as garnish atop each
bowl, and accompany it with warm crusty bread and syrah.

'SONOMA ODYSSEY' JUNE 1, 1996--WORTH A VISIT

  Perfectly in tune with the high quality of Sonoma County food and
wine, the gorgeous, even breathtaking scenery, and laid-back exurban
lifestyle of Sonoma County is its off-the-beaten-track (but not far)
Sonoma Odyssey, June 1, 1996.

  From 1 to 5 PM, at Richard's Grove--Saralee's Vineyard, you can meet
food and wine authors, taste premium wines from 30 producers, sample
Mediterranean style foods (Sonoma County is a dead ringer for Tuscany
and a number of other "mid-earth" ambiances), buy new, used and rare
books, and participate in an auction the nature of which-- who knows?

  To get there you go north from Santa Rosa to the River Road exit of US
Highway 101 (the Luther Burbank Center for the Performing Arts dominates
the view here;  you can't miss it) and go west on River Road to Slusser
Road and turn north to number 3375.

  Tickets are $20.  Information from co-sponsor the Sonoma County Wine
Library, PO Box 43, Healdsburg, CA 95448, tel. 707/433-2485.  The other
sponsors are National Public Radio state KRCB-FM and PBS KRCB-TV,

MURPHY-GOODE 1993 SONOMA COUNTY FUME BLANC-- DON'T RUSH OUT TO GET IT
BECAUSE IT'S SOLD OUT, BUT THEIR 1995, $10.50 IS WIDELY AVAILABLE

  The Airport Club, the health facility where our family spends time and
money (too bad the effects don't show on me), has been serving a 1993
Murphy-Goode fume (sauvignon) blanc that's so good I've wanted to write
about it.  I thought I'd wait for their 1995 to show up on the market,
and taste them side by side.  Not really possible.  But a certain house
style will connect the two, I think, and so I'll tell you the 1995 is
available, list price $10.50, and give you the winery phone number, and
let you know what I think you might want to prepare to go with it.

  The '93 probably has just a hint of residual sugar;  I can just about
detect it and my "threshold" is 0.03 percent.  Alcohol is 13 percent and
in a white wine that level in a crisp wine can make it "hot" but I felt
no such effect.

  Delightful lemon and grapefruit with a background hint of tropical
fruit (typical for the Alexander Valley) come through in a wine that's
crisp from start to lemon-zesty finish.  It's so clean it would be
perfect with any dish with a rich white sauce -- perhaps fettucine so
sauced, with seared and braised tuna slices or chunks?  To prepare that
fresh tuna steak, I'd sear it on a bed of course-ground black pepper,
remove it from the hot iron pan, reduce the heat to medium high and
braise it over lemon slices with enough of the fume blanc to come half-
way up the height of the tuna flake;  remove from the pan when it seems
the tuna will just barely begin to flake, and slice or cube it.

  Alternatively you could make a lemon-garlic creamy white sauce (I use
Knudsen non-dairy sour creme for that).

WARNERVISION ANNOUNCES BUYOUT PLANS

     As expected, WarnerVision Entertainment Pres. Stuart Hersch
will participate in buying company he founded as A*Vision
Entertainment in 1990.  Company announced agreement in principle
for Hong Kong-based Tiger Eye Investments Holdings to buy it from
Warner Music Group.  Deal is expected to close early this year.

     Executives couldn't be reached for comment over holiday
season, when WarnerVision was among many industry-related companies
taking week off.  However, news of Hersch's plans had been expected
for several months.  Fate of WarnerVision and Hersch had been in
question since executive shakeup began at Warner Music Group
earlier last year.  Sources had posed various scenarios -- Hersch
leaving company altogether or leaving Warner Music but taking
WarnerVision with him, as is occurring (VW Nov 6 p6).

     Although ownership is changing, WarnerVision won't sever its
distribution ties with Warner Music -- it has 4-year deal to be
distributed by WEA, sources say.  Name will be changed, though --
WarnerVision name, adopted less than year ago (VW Jan 16 p5), is
likely to revert to A*Vision, name with which company was founded
as affiliate of Warner's Atlantic Records.

     Price Tiger Eye will pay for WarnerVision is in $50-$70
million range, sources said.  Gross sales of WarnerVision, known
for its aggressive stance in acquiring nontheatrical properties,
are believed to be in $120-million range.  It has major share of
fitness video market and owns leading direct response fitness
equipment distribution company Fitness Quest, which it acquired in
1994.  It also distributes children's, music and other special
interest videos along with some direct-to-video movies.

     Tiger Eye Pres.-CEO Robert Book will become chmn. of new
company.  Tiger Eye specializes in acquiring media, publishing and
entertainment companies.  Hersch is expected to continue to run
WarnerVision.  Before founding it he was COO of King World
Productions, serving as key figure in taking company public.

     Time Warner won't lose much by selling WarnerVision, which it
still will distribute.  Although losing ownership of one video
company, Time Warner will gain others if pending merger with Turner
goes through.  Time Warner owns Warner Home Video and HBO Video
along with direct response specialist Time Life;  it will gain
Turner Home Entertainment and New Line.  

     Sale of WarnerVision comes after months of turmoil in
executive ranks of Warner Music Group that most recently resulted
in resignation of Michael Fuchs (VW Nov 20 p7).  Earlier ousters at
Warner Music included Doug Morris, who originally set Hersch up at
Atlantic and now is at MCA -- one of possible future homes that had
been rumored for WarnerVision.

LARGE VIDEO CHAINS GETTING BIGGER PIECE OF PIE

     Stores making up top 100 video chains now represent more than
25% of the more than 28,000 video specialty outlets in U.S.,
according to annual Top 100 report in Video Store Magazine.  Total
number of stores among top 100 chains for 1995 was 7,220 -- 24%
increase over 1994.  However, total revenue for top 100 amounted to
$4.06 billion, only 3% increase over $3.95 billion in 1994.

     Consolidation was main reason for increase in number of
stores, report said.  Acquisition-hungry newly public chains
swallowed many smaller chains that had made Top 100 in past,
leaving room for 24 chains to make list for first time.  Top 20
chains earned $3.65 billion -- up $15 million in year.  Increase
came despite overall decline in video rental business, which Video
Store documents as down 6% for retailers on industrywide basis from
1994.

     However, average Top 100 store grossed only $568,000 in 1995
-- off 16% from $679,000 in 1994.  Drop followed 3 consecutive
years of advances.  Report said decline is "more a result of the
swelling ranks of Top 100 retailers than anything else."  Increase
in total stores of 24% was far greater than any in history of
report since 1987.  Commenting on overall revenue gain of only 3%
for Top 100 chains, report said that "as chains grow, it takes a
while for new stores to come up to speed."

     Video revenue inched up 2% for Top 100 and ancillary revenue
5%, indicating growing importance of such products as snacks,
audiobooks, CD-ROMs, videogames, music, magazines, licensed
merchandise.  Biggest ancillary category, videogames, accounted for
9.8% of average Top 100 store's revenue -- up 4% despite overall
slump in 16-bit market.  Videogame rentals accounted for 8.3%,
sales 1.5%.  Sales and rentals of laserdiscs and CD-ROMs went up
slightly to 0.9% each from 0.8%;  food and drink sales were down
slightly to 0.7% from 0.8%.

     Percentage of average Top 100 store's revenue earned from
videocassette rentals actually increased slightly to 77% from 76.3% 
after several years of decline.  Only 8.3% of average Top 100
store's revenue came from video sellthrough, and almost half of
that was from previously viewed cassettes.  Total was down 10% from
preceding year's 9.3%.

     Blockbuster continued to dominate Top 100, although its power
was slightly diluted because of challenges from newly public
competitors and chains hoping to go public soon.  Blockbuster's
share of Top 100 revenue amounted to 62% in 1995, down from 67% in
1994, and its gross revenues for 1995 were $2.6 billion.  Company
had 3,350 domestic locations at year-end.

     Hollywood Video, which went public in 1993, exploded to 280
stores in 1995 from 97, increasing revenues to $165 million from
$73 million.  Movie Gallery, which made initial public offering
(IPO) in Aug. 1994, grew to 665 stores in 1995 including 90
franchisees, from 279, increasing revenue to almost $200 million
from $90 million.  Video Update, whose IPO was in July 1994, rose
to 250 stores from 45, growing revenue to $82.5 million from $26.9
million.  Moovies, only chain to complete IPO in 1995
(Aug.),expanded to 107 stores  from 11, with revenue soaring to $49
million from $5.5 million.

     Home Vision, which filed registration statement for IPO in
Oct. that has yet to hit market, increased its store count to 53
from 38 during year, with growing to $25.5 million from $18.8
million.  West Coast Entertainment, franchiser that was purchased
by smaller Giant Video in 1995, had about 500 franchised locations
throughout year, with revenues increasing to $195 million from
$183.6 million, report said, and plans IPO early this year. 
Roadrunner Video, which became public by merging with shell company
Business Data Group in July, maintained 53 stores throughout year
with annual revenues of $22 million.  First National Entertainment,
public company that originated as film distributor, purchased
25-store Video Tyme of Las Vegas, with annual revenue of $13.1
million.

     Top 10 chains accounted for 84.8% of Top 100 revenue -- $3.44
billion.  Preceding year's top 10 accounted for 83.2% of total.  Of
entire video specialty business, top 10 chains drew 39% of income,
up from 34% in 1994.  Top 10, ranked by 1995 gross revenue, were
(1) Blockbuster, (2) West Coast, (3) Hollywood, (4) Movie Gallery,
(5) Tower Records/Video, (6) Video Update, (7) Moovies, (8) Video
Connection (recently sold to Movie Gallery), (9) Palmer Video
(expected to be sold to West Coast), (10) Home Vision.

     Chain with most revenue per store was tiny 2-store Odyssey
Video of L.A. -- No. 82 on Top 100 list, its locations had average
rental revenue of $1.45 million.  Blockbuster Video stores averaged
highest amount of rental income -- $645,900 per store, down from
$826,300 in 1994.  Chain with highest sellthrough revenue per store
was RKO Warner Video, which ironically was forced into liquidation
at year-end despite almost doubling sellthrough income to $241,500
per store from $143,182 in 1994 (see separate item in this issue). 
Average Top 100 store earned only $37,776 from sellthrough in 1995.

     Lion's share of consumer dollars spent on video sellthrough
isn't claimed by video specialists.  Video Store puts total
industry retail revenue at $14.5 billion for 1995, $8.3 billion of
it spent in video specialty stores ($7.6 billion rental and only
$690 million sellthrough).  That leaves whopping $6.2 billion spent
in nonspecialty outlets, most of them sellthrough-oriented.  Top 10
stores of any type carrying video in N. America in 1995, according
to report:  (1) Blockbuster, (2) Suncoast Motion Picture Co. (410
stores, $280 million in video revenue), (3) Wal-Mart (2,189 stores,
$271 million in video revenue), (4) K mart (2,163 stores, $249
million), (5) merged Price Club/Costco (242 stores, $173 million),
(6) West Coast Video, (7) Wherehouse Entertainment (327 stores,
$155 million), (8) Sam's Club (433 stores, $141 million), (9)
Musicland/Sam Goody (869 stores, $139 million), (10) Hollywood
Video.

NOV. VCR SALES HIT RECORD, CENSUS TOPS 150 MILLION

     Our running count of VCR sales since inception in 1975 shows
cumulative total U.S. sales hit 150 million in Nov. after just over
20 years on market.  In other Nov. hardware news, EIA figures show
dealers' purchases of VCR and several other consumer electronics
products set records for month despite less-than-enthusiastic
estimates of holiday sales potential.

     TV/VCR combo sales showed biggest advance of all -- 49.1% --
but fell shy of record for month because of huge combo sales in
Nov. 1993.  VCR decks, achieving record, were up 23.5%.  VCR census
passed 150 million unit mark in 4th week of Nov., reaching
150,039,297 (VW Dec 11 p8).

     Here's how 1995 probably will go down in record books, based
on seasonal rates for first 11 months:  Direct-view color
(excluding combos), 23.56 million, down 4.8% from last year's
record 24.71 million.  Projection TV, 828,700, big 30.3% gain over
1994's record 636,177.  TV/VCR, 2,190,000, record 8.5% more than
1994's 2.02 million.  VCR decks, record at 13.71 million, 4.7% over
13.09 million last year.  Camcorders, 3.66 million, topping 1994
record of 3.21 million by 14%.

     Following is table of EIA figures on sales to dealers for
Nov.:

16-BIT VIDEOGAMES HOLD SHARE AMID NEW FORMAT BATTLES

     "Old-fashioned" 16-bit videogame systems probably will hold
onto major market share even this year as manufacturers wage war of
words, games and marketing dollars over high-powered new
technology.

     Sparking latest contretemps were comments by 3DO Chmn. William
(Trip) Hawkins that internal "bus" structure of Nintendo Ultra 64
would severely limit performance of system overall, and was like
"squeezing a fire hose into a garden hose."

     "That's bull," said Nintendo of America Sales & Mktg. Exec. Vp
Peter Main.  At issue is ability of Nintendo's system to move
information from one part of machine to another.  Some portions of
Nintendo's machine use 32-bit bus structure.  Hawkins says that
will limit system's performance, Main and Nintendo engineers say
absolutely not.  What's clear is that such battles definitely will
wind up dominating media coverage and high-end game scene -- but
perhaps not dollar volume.

     Introduction of Ultra 64 in Japan is absolute lock for April
21, Main said.  Picture in U.S. is far fuzzier, with potential
launch dates ranging from May to Aug.  Some observers are betting
on spring launch themed on Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in
L.A.  If that's to be case, Nintendo is going to have to do some
fast advertising footwork.  In visit last week to Nintendo's
Redmond, Wash., hq, company told our affiliated publication
Consumer Multimedia Report that no ads had been placed in game fan
periodicals, even though deadlines are drawing near.  Another sign
that Ultra may come later rather than sooner:  Despite flying
half-dozen journalists to Redmond, Nintendo had only Ultra 64
videotape to show, not game itself.

     One thing is sure:  1995 was tough year for videogame
industry, Nintendo included.  "This year was called the great year
of confusion," Main said.  One big challenge:  Primary audience --
8-12-year-old boys -- is getting more choosy than ever before,
willing to skip products that don't offer dramatic edge in
performance and game play.  "We're dealing with 8-12-year-olds
acting like 35-40-year-olds in terms of savvy," he said.  That's
resulted in good and bad news for Nintendo -- software sales have
been strong, but company's new hardware introduction, Virtual Boy,
is struggling so hard that company is planning "relaunch" in both
U.S. and Japan.

     "It was the year of hits, not bits," Main said, with winner
determined by "who is going to have the greatest content."  He
pointed to Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country 2 as both hit and good
software product.  "Even while other software is selling at best
60-70% of last year's totals, this one has worldwide demand of
110-120%," he said.  One sign that strength of 16-bit market caught
Nintendo as well as most of rest of videogame market by surprise is
fact that DKC2 is sold out on global basis.  Main predicted 16-bit
strength would continue to lesser degree through 1996.  "At this
time next year [16-bit] is going to represent 35-40% of the
videogame market," he said.

     While Donkey Kong may be doing well, rest of videogame market
isn't setting any records.  Projections were that game market would
be down anywhere from 5-6% to 20%, Main said.  He thinks total
decline will come to 10-12%, with U.S. videogame dollar volume at
$3.8-$3.9 million.  Once counted out, 16-bit products represent 2/3
of that, he said.  Market share of 16-bit games declined to 66% of
total sales in 1995 to 77% in 1994.  Hand-held market share also
slumped, to 15-16% from 25%.  That still represents some
significant volume, though.  "We've got 19 million Game Boys sold,"
Main said.  "This year we'll be moving 5.7 million pieces."

     New technology, including 32-bit games and Virtual Boy,
account for only fraction of total market, about 19%, Main said. 
He estimated that fewer than one million units of 32-bit consoles
sold.  Of that number, Sony's Playstation accounted for
400,000-500,000, Sega's Saturn for 200,000 and 3DO for 150,000,
with Atari's Jaguar and other devices accounting for rest.  By
contrast, 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment system sold 2.4
million units, he said.  Virtual Boy's sales were far under
expectations, Main admitted.  "It's been a long year for Virtual
Boy in the U.S."  Even though 3D game playing units have sold far
under expectations, "we are not finished with Virtual Boy," he
said.

     Nintendo has sold 400,000 Virtual Boys in U.S. and 250,000 in
Japan, Main said.  Games released for unit just scratch surface of
its unique capabilities, he said.  In Japan, "they are planning to
relaunch the product in February," he said, with similar relaunch
set for U.S.  "It has not seen its full potential.  It is going to
have another round."

     One area Nintendo isn't planning to explore is CD-ROM games. 
Cost structures in CD-ROM market benefit manufacturers, not
consumers, Main said.  When it comes to adding bulk memory capacity
to Ultra 64, Nintendo is going to stick with recordable magnetic
disc that company already has announced, he said.  Disc will move
at 8 times CD-ROM speed.  Position may leave Nintendo vulnerable
when DVD hits market, since competing M-2 and Sony PlayStation
systems reportedly will be able to play back DVD discs with
relatively simple upgrade.  Signs are that Ultra 64, with its
proprietary magnetic discs, won't have that capability.

     Rental prebook record was shattered twice in 1995.  Fox last
month reported orders of 735,000 copies of Die Hard with a
Vengeance in N. America, including revenue sharing and not
including laserdisc and direct mail.  Film released on video Dec.
19 grossed $100 million at box office.  Buena Vista earlier
reported 715,000-piece order for Pulp Fiction, highest total since
LIVE released Terminator 2 (VW Sept 4 p5).  Both Die Hard 3 and
Pulp Fiction prebooked during period when retailers overall were
experiencing downturn in rental business.  Record numbers reflect
fact that video business is becoming increasingly hit-driven, with
top titles dominating while other categories suffer.  Figures also
attest to growing importance of revenue sharing, with Rentrak now
servicing many top chains;  both Fox and Buena Vista, which have
contracts with Rentrak, are benefiting from increased orders for
their titles from Rentrak by settling for less money upfront while
awaiting share of retailers' income from rentals.

     Commenting on 3M's leaving videotape manufacturing business,
TDK Mktg. Vp Tim Sullivan warned retailers to beware of
"nonmanufacturing tape suppliers who will seize the opportunity to
build market share by cutting prices."  Buying from such suppliers
could be "penny wise and pound foolish," he said, because 3M's
departure could create supply shortage, leaving those suppliers
with inadequate quantities.  With demand high for blank and pancake
tape, "suppliers who lack the capacity to manufacture their own
product will not be able to service their retail customers with
sufficient quantities of tape," Sullivan said.

SUPERFUND HIT-The toxic-waste cleanup program joins the rest
of EPA in the federal budget-morass shutdown today when
Superfund's tax-and-spend authority expires. Officials say
this means furloughing about 2,500 agency employees who
oversee contractor activities at waste sites. The employees
were able to continue working beyond the Dec. 18 government
shutdown because Superfund's operating authority is separate
from the rest of the agency. This authority ends today, and
officials say that without the site supervisors, "we're
going to have to shut down the program nationwide"-except
for emergencies. The waste cleanup trust fund does not lack
money, only the congressional go-ahead to spend it.

A LITTLE LATE?-First, EPA gives in to state opposition and
drops its unpopular test-only requirement for vehicle-
emission inspection and maintenance stations. Next, Congress
takes steps to ensure that test-only mandates remain on the
regulatory shelf. Finally, with the barn door wide open, the
Association of Vehicle Inspection Companies was formed in
Washington last month by the firms that operate test-only
facilities under state contracts. Its rear-guard mission:
"to provide sound information to help educate the public,
state officials, political leaders and others on the
significant benefits of test-only contractor-operated
vehicle inspection programs."

EMPLOYERS OFF THE HOOK-Another mobile-source pollution-
prevention program headed for the discard bin when President
Clinton signed legislation Dec. 23 repealing the Clean Air
Act mandate for employers in polluted areas to adopt plans
to reduce commuting by employees. The Mobility Coalition for
Clean Air, the ad hoc group that lobbied for the repeal,
said it expects most states to abandon mandatory trip-
reduction requirements.

THE CHLORINE FACTOR-Findings by resear-chers at Queen's
University in Canada could have a bearing on U.S. EPA's
ongoing evaluation of drinking water disinfectants and
disinfection byproducts. The researchers report that from 10
percent to 13 percent of bladder or colon cancer cases in
Ontario may be caused by long-term drinking of and bathing
in surface water treated with chlorine. Professor Will King
said people with a 35-year exposure to chlorinated
byproducts have a 60 percent risk of bladder cancer than
people with little or no exposure. "We think the results are
important, but we don't think they mean stop using
chlorination. It's still much safer to use chlorinated water
than to use untreated water."

WHAT'S HOT IN MINNESOTA?-In a year-end review of its top
environmental issues of 1995, the state Pollution Control
Agency listed "the curious discovery of numerous deformed
frogs" in wetlands in southern Minnesota last August.
Officials are still seeking answers for the frogs' missing
legs.

PROCESS BORROWED FROM THE COLD WAR
VALUABLE ALLY FOR WASTEWATER PLANTS


   A process borrowed from U.S. and Russian Cold War
technology may perform a wide array of valuable functions
for wastewater treatment plant operators, according to
Scientific Utilization Inc. (SUI).

   In pilot studies, the pulse power process increased the
rate of anaerobic digestion in treatment units, the Decatur,
Ala., company reports. It also can boost methane production,
lower the volume of solids and neutralize cryptosporidium,
SUI says.

   Using pulse power, plant operators may be able to double
anaerobic digestion of sewage sludges, SUI says. This can
help boost methane production to power blowers, generators,
heaters and other devices in treatment plants, according to
SUI.

   The technique works by subjecting sludge to high-energy
electric arcs as it enters a plant's digesters. The arcs
rupture the cell walls of aerobic bacteria, making their
nutrients immediately available to anaerobic bacteria and
reducing the time it takes anaerobic organisms to consume
aerobic microbes and cut solids volume.

   Pulse power also may help turn sewage effluent into
potable water, according to the company. When used with
ozone and oxygen generation, the system has been shown to
render cryptosporidium non-infectious. For more information,

EPA AUDIT POLICY PROVIDES LENIENCY
BUT GRANTS NO 'PRIVILEGE' TO RESULTS


   Companies that report self-discovered environmental
violations within 10 days and act to correct them will be
eligible for reduced penalties or waivers of civil
violations and no criminal sanctions under EPA's final
policy on environmental audits.

   The policy (Federal Register, Dec. 22, 1995, p. 66706)
does not apply to violations that harm human health and the
environment. EPA said it had been studying the issue of
self-audits for 18 months and that the policy is "the
optimum way to encourage voluntary self-policing while
preserving fair and effective enforcement."

Will Override State Laws

   Under the approach, EPA retains its power to levy fines
that equal any economic gain created by the violation in
order to "preserve a level playing field." EPA also will
override state laws shielding results of corporate self-
audits from enforcement if the violations threaten public
health or the environment. At the same time, the agency said
"where a state has obtained appropriate sanctions needed to
deter such misconduct, there is no need for EPA action."

   The final policy is basically the same as an interim
policy released last March. The earlier statement applied
only to self-audits, while the final statement covers other
self-discovery steps such as due diligence. EPA defines due
diligence as systemic efforts to prevent, detect and correct
violations.

EPA Restates 'No Privilege'

   EPA will continue its policy of not routinely requesting
the results of corporate self-audits, although the agency
reiterated its position that environmental self-audits and
related corporate self-discovery activities are not
privileged information protected from public disclosure.
This contrasts sharply with an increasing number of state
laws that provide varying degrees of privilege for audit
results.

   EPA will reduce gravity-based civil penalties-those based
on the severity of the pollution problem and not on the
economic gains a company realizes-by up 75 percent. In some
cases they could be waived. To be eligible for reduced or no
civil penalties provisions of the policy, EPA said companies
must meet these conditions:

Violations must be discovered through a company's self-
audits or due-diligence process.

Violations must have been discovered voluntarily and not as
part of an EPA- or court-mandated monitoring, and the
violations must be reported promptly in writing to EPA.

Discovery of a violation cannot be based on any third-party
action such as a citizen suit or local government
investigation.

The violation must be corrected as soon as possible, and any
environmental damage must be mitigated.

The company must take steps to prevent any reoccurrence of
the violation.

Leniency is not available to repeat offenders. Repeated
offenses are defined as "the same or closely-related
violation...[occurring] previously within the past three
years at the same facility or...part of a pattern of
violations on the regulated entities' part over the past
five years."

Not eligible are violations that led to substantial
environmental harm or presented an imminent and substantial
danger to public health or which violated the terms of a
court order.

A company must cooperate with EPA and provide data that
could reveal related violations.

   Copies of the seven-page policy statement signed by
Steven Herman, assistant agency administrator for
enforcement and compliance are available from BPI's %
DocuDial Service as Doc. #03-1103.

ASME: CHLORINE LEVELS OF FEEDSTOCKS
HAVE SCANT ROLE IN DIOXIN EMISSIONS


   The chlorine content of combustor or incinerator
feedstocks has little or no effect on the composition or
quantity of dioxin emissions, the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers and other participants found in a study
of various combustion facilities.

   The conclusion contradicts arguments by public interest
groups that there is a direct relationship between chlorine
and dioxin emissions. The groups have advocated regulations
restricting the amount and type of chlorinated waste that
can be combusted in various types of combustion systems.

   The study was conducted on municipal waste combustors,
medical and hazardous waste incinerators, waste-fired
boilers, cement kilns and biomass combustors at 169
facilities. More than 1,900 test results were analyzed for
The Relationship Between Chlorine in Waste Streams and
Dioxin Emissions from Waste Combustor Stacks.

   Researchers say they found no statistically significant
relationship between chlorine input and dioxin emissions in
gas streams at 80 percent of the facilities. Ten facilities
showed higher dioxin/furan levels consistent with increases
in chlorine input, but eight other facilities showed a
decrease in dioxin/furan emissions, the study says.

   "The failure to find simultaneous increases in most
cases-and finding a few inverse relationships-indicates that
whatever effect waste feed chlorine has on [dioxin]
concentrations in combustor flue gases, it is smaller than
the influence of other cau-sative factors," ASME said in a
statement. "Any effect chlorine has on...concentrations in
commercial-scale systems is a factor of air pollution-
control system temperature, ash chemistry, combustion
conditions, imprecise measurement and localized flow
stratification."

   Besides ASME, other participants in the study included
the Vinyl Institute, the Chlorine Chemistry Council and
Environment Canada. For a copy of the study, contact ASME at
(800) 843-2763.

UPCOMING NSR RULE TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY
TO STATES IN MAKING BACT DECISIONS


   Proposed new source review (NSR) rules to be announced
soon by EPA will recommend a "top-down" approach for
determining best available control technology (BACT), but
they will give states some flexibility in determining what
method to use.

   The proposal will allow states to develop their own BACT
determination criteria so long as they take into account the
top technologies available. Under the plan, states will be
given a set of minimum criteria they must use in developing
methods for making BACT determinations.

   Dennis Crumpler, head of the NSR section of EPA's air
quality planning & standards office, told EW the government
shutdown and furlough affecting EPA would delay the schedule
to reform NSR.

   BACT is an emission limitation based on the maximum
degree of emission reduction achievable through application
of production processes, available methods, systems and
techniques. Crumpler said the rule will propose using a top-
down approach to identify BACT technology.

   New emissions sources located in areas that are in
attainment with ambient air quality standards are required
to install BACT under "prevention of significant
deterioration" requirements. BACT is determined on a case-
by-case basis for each source required to install it.

   Under the top-down method, available control options are
ranked by effectiveness for the pollutant under review.
Initially, the most stringent option is regarded as the
BACT, but source-specific energy, environmental, or economic
considerations may alter the initial determination. States
are given the discretion to determine what is the BACT for
the sources they regulate, but EPA adds two core conditions
to the state's deliberations.

   First, a source must consider all available controls in
making a BACT determination, especially the most stringent
control. Second, the draft rule will say, "the selection of
a particular control system as BACT must be justified in
terms of the statutory criteria and supported by the record,
and must explain the basis for the rejection of the other
more stringent candidate control systems."

OCCIDENTAL TO PAY U.S. $129M TO SETTLE
LANDMARK LOVE-CANAL POLLUTION CASE


   Ending a landmark case that provided the impetus for the
Superfund program, Occidental Chemical Corp. has agreed to
pay $129 million to cover costs associated with the massive
pollution of Love Canal. The settlement announced by the
Justice Department ends a 16-year-old cost-recovery case
that began after a toxic-waste nightmare forced abandonment
of more than 1,000 homes near Niagara Falls.

   The proposed settlement "should send a message of federal
persistence and tenacity," Attorney General Janet Reno said
Dec. 21. She said the government will recoup all of the $101
million it spent on the cleanup, plus $28 million in
interest.

   EPA's Superfund program will receive $102 million from
Occidental, with $27 million going to the Treasury on behalf
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, DoJ said. FEMA
provided funding for early cleanup and relocation efforts
before creation of the Superfund program in 1980.

Remediation Actions Taken

   After enactment of the Superfund law, the U.S. government
and New York remediated the Love Canal site. Creeks and
sewers adjacent to Love Canal were cleansed of dioxin
wastes, and federal and state agencies improved a leachate
collection system to contain contaminated groundwater.

   Occidental was considered a "responsible party" under
Superfund. The company has insisted that the United States
also was a responsible party and should contribute toward
cleanup costs based on regulatory actions and alleged
dumping by several federal agencies. Under the settlement,
the government will pay $8 million in cleanup costs to
resolve this claim.

   One bright spot for Occidental could be a proposed $64.5
million tax credit for its Love Canal payment-a proposal
that was criticized by Lois Schiffer, head of DoJ's
environmental section. "This would destroy the fundamental
principle that a polluter should pay to clean up its own
mess."

   Joining Reno in supporting the agreement was EPA
Administrator Carol Browner, who said it represented "this
Administration's firm commitment to ensuring that polluters,
not the American people, pick up the tab for cleaning up
toxic waste dumps." FEMA expressed relief that "the
Superfund law has enabled us to recover our money." The
settlement will not be final until after a 30-day public
comment period. For more information, call DoJ at (202) 616-
2771.

EPA OFFICIALS: BUDGET REDUCTIONS
COULD LEAD TO MAJOR STAFF LAYOFFS


   The temporary furloughing of EPA workers under the
partial government shutdown may turn into permanent layoffs
for up to one-quarter of the agency's 17,000 employees by
spring, EPA officials warn. Unless Republicans substantially
increase EPA's funding, the agency's cut in employees "will
be devastating," EPA Administrator Carol Browner says.

   While officials have repeatedly said they cannot predict
how deep personnel cuts would be, they estimate that under
the EPA appropriations bill vetoed by President Clinton, the
agency would have to lay off one-third of its workers who
promulgate regulations, issue permits and perform
inspections. Researchers and employees involved in
environmental cleanups would not be cut, according to one
official.

   At a press conference Dec. 18, President Clinton said he
vetoed the $5.7 billion spending bill-that called for a
decrease of 21 percent from the fiscal 1995 level-because
environmental enforcement would be cut 25 percent, safe
drinking water aid to local governments would be slashed 45
percent and the air would become dirtier. The cuts would
condemn "10 million children under the age of 12 to living
near toxic waste sites that might not be cleaned up for
years," Clinton said.

   The spending bill (H.R. 2099) contains six policy riders,
including a first-ever provision that would prevent EPA from
overriding Army Corps of Engineers' wetlands decisions. The
package also proposes a 50 percent cut in funding to
implement the Montreal treaty for protection of the ozone
layer.

   In his veto statement, Clinton said that "when I agreed a
few weeks ago to work with the Congress to balance the
budget in seven years, Congress committed to a budget that
protects the environment. These bills that I have to veto
today, I do because they do not meet that test. For 25
years, leaders of both parties have recognized that our
country is stronger when we control pollution and protect
public health. Environmental protection is not, or at least
it never has been until now, a partisan issue."

   In response to earlier Democratic attacks on EPA funding
cuts, Sen. Christopher Bond (R-Mo), chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that handles EPA funding, said:
"I am first to admit EPA did receive some targeted budget
cuts in the appropriations process, but the reductions come
from areas which were identified by the National Academy of
Public Administration and others as being unnecessary,
wasteful or duplicative."

SENATE ENVIRONMENT PANEL MEMBERS
BACKING LIMITED REWRITING OF CWA


   Key members of the Senate Environment Committee are
making it clear they support little more than a fine-tuning
of the Clean Water Act in the 104th Congress-not the
sweeping rollback bill passed by the House (A/WPR, May. 22,
1995, p. 163).

   Chairman John Chafee (R-R.I.), in the first of a series
of hearings on reauthorizing the CWA, said he favors a
modest bill with a limited agenda because a more ambitious
package such as H.R. 961 would be harder to get through the
legislative process and would engender strident opposition
that would undermine more important goals.

   The panel's ranking Democrat, Max Baucus of Montana, said
the CWA is a "major, major success story" and that "House
efforts to gut" it were "shortsighted, misdirected and
wrongheaded....No CWA reauthorization would be better than
the one the House suggested." Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.)
added that health and economic benefits for the fishing and
tourism industries have justified the high costs of CWA-
mandated improvements.

   A frequent critic of environmental laws, Sen. Christopher
Bond (R-Mo.), told the hearing that the CWA deserves credit
for rehabilitating the Mississippi River. He said water
quality has been getting better over the past two decades
and that he supports continued progress. Bond said he will
work to fix CWA stormwater provisions he considers "broken"
and will stress the importance of proceeding with an
understanding of what local entities, states and the federal
government can afford. "We have cities spending upwards of
$650,000 to obtain [stormwater discharge] permits. This
expenditure does not result in cleaner waters." Bond added
that "assessing humungous [CWA] fines against small
communities with limited resources is probably the dumbest
thing you can do if you want to improve the environment."

   The focus on the hearing was the CWA's impact on state
and local governments. Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) urged
the committee to consider his proposal, S. 1390, to allow
CWA fines to be invested in local pollution prevention and
remediation rather than sending the money to Washington.

Move to Ease Privatization

   Lautenberg has introduced S 1436 to help local
governments privatize wastewater facilities by addressing a
legal quirk setting different standards for privately- and
publicly-owned systems. The bill would expand the definition
of a publicly-owned treatment works to include systems that
were constructed, owned or operated by government but
transferred to the private sector. Ronald Dungan, president
of the National Association of Water Companies, testified
that more private-sector participation is needed in
wastewater treatment because the cost of repairing and
maintaining infrastructure is beyond the finances of
governments and municipal utilities. Dungan said S 1436
would provide a "single and clear definition of a wastewater
treatment facility based on purpose rather than ownership."

   Al Bilik, president of the AFL-CIO's public employee
department, said organized labor strongly opposes
privatization because it would result in a deterioration of
the quality of public works. Businesses' top priority is
making money, not public well-being, he testified. Investors
might be able to buy public utilities at bargain-basement
prices and milk them for profit while maintaining an outward
appearance of functioning well, Bilik said. If the utility
goes bankrupt, the government will be left holding the bag
because these services are vital, he warned.

   Robert Perciasepe, head of EPA's water office, said that
in order to make $2 billion in loans to states annually for
the next 30 years, $10 billion needs to be invested in the
wastewater state revolving fund (SRF) over the next seven
years. President Clinton requested $1.59 billion in fiscal
1996 to support the SRF program. The appropriations bill
passed by Congress would provide $1.25 billion for
wastewater capitalization grants for 1996, Perciasepe said.
EPA is requesting authorization levels of $1.3 billion for
fiscal 1997 and $1 billion for 1998 through 2005.

API ASKS EPA TO REVISIT RFG PHASE II
TO REPEAL NOX-REDUCTION PROVISIONS


   The American Petroleum Institute is asking EPA to repeal
provisions in the second phase of the reformulated gasoline
(RFG) program requiring reductions in nitrogen oxide
emissions. The trade group says in a petition that the NOx-
reduction requirements are not a cost-effective means to
control summertime ozone and may not be beneficial. API also
argues that reductions in NOx have been demonstrated in some
cases not to be an effective way to curb ozone.

   The NOx requirement was based partly on a 1991 National
Research Council report that said more attention should be
focused on NOx as a means to control ozone. The second phase
of the RFG program calls for NOx emissions reductions of 5
percent to 7 percent, beginning in 2000. API's petition
states that although EPA used findings from that study, it
discounted "those portions of the same studies showing that
NOx control may be counterproductive in many areas,
depending on the VOC/NOx ratio."

Disagreement over Costs

   There is considerable debate on the cost of the
desulfurization of gasoline, a major part of the RFG
program. While EPA contends that reducing sulfur to 138
parts per million would have a nationwide cost of about
$5,200 per ton, API counsel David Deal said the cost is
closer to more than $10,000 per ton. Deal said this cost
would be passed on to consumers. "We have good reason to
want to reassess the program before people make a
commitment."

   The petition makes another point concerning costs,
stating that the cost of controlling NOx emissions in fuels
relative to the cost of stationary sources has not been
given enough attention by EPA.

   API wants the agency to respond promptly so refiners may
have enough time to make the necessary adjustments to their
facilities. Although phase II of the RFG program does not
begin for another five years, "the lead time to make
refinery changes is about three years. So sometime in 1997
is the time by which it is important to know what the story
is," Deal said. A copy of the 32-page petition is available
from BPI's % DocuDial Service as Doc. #03-1104.

EW FOCUS: OPEN MEETINGS
HAZWASTE INCINERATORS, GREEN GROUPS
CHALLENGE EPA-CEMENT NEGOTIATIONS


   A lawsuit seeking to prevent EPA from using closed-door
meetings with the cement kiln industry to reach an
"enforceable agreement" on cement kiln dust (CKD) disposal
rules is coming down to whether the selective process can be
defined as a federal advisory committee. The
plaintiffs-Environmental Technology Council (ETC), Sierra
Club and four local environmental advocacy groups-contend
that EPA-cement industry meetings since March violate the
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The cement industry
and EPA argue they do not.

   A cement industry official told EW Dec. 27 that despite
the diverse makeup of the plaintiffs, the case is being
pushed by the incinerator industry in an effort to gain
competitive advantage in the market for waste-treatment
services.

   The suit (Huron Environmental Activist League et al. v.
U.S. EPA, DC DC, No. 95-2124) was filed Nov. 15 (EW, Dec. 4,
1995, p. 473). The battle widened when the Cement Kiln
Recycling Coalition (CKRC) and the American Portland Cement
Alliance (APCA) intervened as defendants on Nov. 29. Since
then, papers have been flying: motions for summary judgment
were filed by all sides Dec. 8; all sides filed responses
Dec. 15, prompting still further motions. Judge Charles
Richey of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia will decide soon as to whether EPA's meetings with
the cement industry violate FACA requirements.

   FACA is meant to control how private groups become a
source of advice and recommendations to Federal agencies. It
requires notice of meetings in the Federal Register and that
an agency official approve agendas and be present at all
meetings.

   EPA and the cement industry had been negotiating since
March over an enforceable agreement on CKD disposal. The
agency had already decided not to expose cement kilns to all
of the rigors of the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act's
(RCRA) Subtitle C, which governs disposal of hazardous
wastes. The plaintiffs charge that seven EPA-cement industry
meetings violated FACA. EPA got advice on management
standards from only one interest group, "closed its meetings
with the cement industry...and denied plaintiffs' request
to attend the meetings," says the Dec. 8 defendants' motion
for summary judgment.

   EPA allegedly provided no public notice, no meeting
summaries and no agendas, and no documents developed from
the meetings were made available to the public. The
plaintiffs also charge that EPA utilized APCA and CKRC as an
"advisory committee" in the sense of FACA without formally
establishing one. Once the cement industry proposed that the
agency promulgate an "enforceable agreement" to manage CKD
standards, EPA crossed the line into territory governed by
FACA, the plaintiffs contend.

   In its motion, EPA contends that the cement kiln groups
cannot be defined as "advisory committees" under FACA
because they were not established, funded or controlled by
the government. Mere use of the committee's work product is
not enough to trigger FACA rules; the government must
exercise strict management over the group, EPA argues. EPA
referred to the only FACA case judged by the U.S. Supreme
Court (Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S.
1989), in which the justices upheld EPA's consultations with
the activist group founded by Ralph Nader. In that case, the
majority wrote: "We cannot believe that FACA was intended to
cover every formal and informal consultation between an
agency and a group rendering advice."

   In a response filed Dec. 15, the plaintiffs maintain that
EPA managed the advisory group and its agenda; controlled
the process by identifying the issues for the group to
address; controlled participation by denying plaintiffs'
requests to attend meetings; and suspended its efforts to
develop regulatory standards in order to conduct the
advisory-group process. The plaintiffs also argue they will
not have meaningful input on an enforceable agreement if
they cannot meet simultaneously with the cement industry and
EPA.

   Andy O'Hare, vice president of APCA, told EW that the
rival waste-incineration industry "has been meeting with EPA
all along but claims that only the cement kiln industry's
private meetings are in violation of FACA." In its motion,
EPA says that it met at least once since March with all of
the plaintiffs on the enforceable agreement.

   O'Hare, while claiming CKD is "innocuous" from a public
health standpoint, said the plaintiffs are led by the
incinerator industry. "This whole case should be seen as an
attempt by the incinerator industry to regain
"competitivity." It is not an environmental issue; it is a
market-share issue." ETC, formerly known as the Hazardous
Waste Treatment Council, filed the case using their lawyer
and brought along the environmentalists to bolster the case
for the incinerator interests, he charged.

   ETC lawyer David Case was not available to respond to the
statements about the suit's genesis.

CALIFORNIA AIR BOARD MOVES TO DROP
MINIMUM ZEV MANDATE FOR 1998


   California has begun formalizing its retreat from its
smog-fighting mandate for zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) to
comprise at least 2 percent of the new cars and light trucks
marketed in the state in 1998.

   The action throws into doubt whether Massachusetts and
New York will maintain their similar mandates, which would
translate into minimum sales of electric vehicles.
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld (R) said, "We think the
California Air Resources [Board] staff made the wrong
recommendation, but the decision does not bind
Massachusetts." In New York, a spokesman for Gov. George
Pataki (R) made only the following statement: "the staff is
evaluating New York State's legal obligation in the wake of
California's decision."

   Electric car supporters and clean-air advocates charge
that California Gov. Pete Wilson (R) gave into the massive
anti-electric vehicle advertising and public relations
campaign financed by petroleum refiners and car
manufacturers.

Mandate for 2003 Retained

   California's Air Resources Board (CARB), which pioneered
ZEV-sales mandates, will sponsor ZEV demonstration projects
in Los Angeles and Sacramento. They will use only 3,750
ZEVs, rather than the 60,000 projected under the shelved
mandate. CARB maintains its requirement that 10 percent of
total vehicles sales in the state will be ZEVs in 2003.

   CARB Chair John Dunlap said: "This [revised] plan
provides for a successful launch of commercially viable
electric cars that protect public health and will provide
new high-tech jobs in California. This plan promotes a
market-based introduction of ZEVs and will unleash the
engineering and the marketing prowess of automakers."

   A spokesman for the California-based Coalition for Clean
Air said the group has "seen no scientific or technical
reason for delay. The agency responsible for worldwide
adoption of catalytic converters, unleaded gasoline and
reformulated gasoline has never before buckled to political
pressure."

   The ZEV retreat is laid out in a CARB staff proposal that
is subject to change pending final action in March. Other
staff recommendations include:

Automakers voluntarily introduce ZEVs, with an annual
production capacity of 5,000 in 1996-1997 rising to 14,000
in 1998.

Automakers produce cleaner standard cars to make up for the
shortfall in lower emissions without the ZEVs.

Automakers place 750 ZEVs in 1998 and 1,500 in 1999-2000 in
the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas.

Automakers commit to continued ZEV research and development.

CARB creates extra ZEV credits for longer-range vehicles and
early introduction of electrics.

Each year the state will buy some advanced-battery vehicles.

The staff proposal also calls upon all automakers to change
their media publicity and legislative initiatives from
attacking the ZEV mandate to supporting the state-
manufacturers' ZEV partnership.

COSTLY RULE SETS MACT STANDARDS
FOR NEWER MUNICIPAL INCINERATORS


   Newer municipal waste combustors (MWCs) will be required
to install a combination of high-efficiency pollution-
control equipment starting Jan. 29, if a direct final rule
from EPA does not draw significant negative comments. While
the rule enables EPA to reduce several pollutants
simultaneously, it is expected to impose substantial capital
costs.

   The maximum achievable control technology standard will
affect existing and new MWCs capable of combusting more than
35 metric tons daily. It establishes emissions limits for
dioxins, furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter,
hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and
fugitive ash. Stricter performance standards apply to MWCs
with capacities greater than 225 metric tons a day.

   The rule, published in the Dec. 19 Federal Register,
mandates that MWCs built after Sept. 20, 1994, or modified
after June 19, 1996, will be subject to new, more stringent
performance standards. MWCs built between Dec. 20, 1989 and
Sept. 20, 1994, or modified before June 19, 1996, will
remain subject to MWC performance standards for plants built
after the 1989 date. This provision was promulgated Feb. 11,
1991. The dates were set to avoid same MWC plants being
subject to overlapping rules.

   EPA says there are about 307 operating MWC units at 128
plants, providing a total combustion capacity of 94,000
metric tons per day. It says that 179 MWCs will be affected
by the rule; about 100 are publicly owned. Costs for the
updated standard exceed those for the 1991 standard by $156
million for capital investment and by $43 million for annual
operations. Total capital costs from investments mandated by
both rules approach $780 million, or an added $13 per metric
ton of solid waste combusted.

   The agency says the benefits include annual emissions
greater than the 1991 rule: 3,000 fewer metric tons of SO2
and 4,000 fewer metric tons of hydrogen chloride. For most
categories there is less than a 10 percent improvement, but
for mercury, the new standard will eliminate 200 percent of
the amount removed by the 1991 rule. In total, the rule
expects to reduce emissions of several hazardous air
pollutants by about 110,000 tons per year, EPA says.

   If a facility combusts less than 10 metric tons a day of
solid waste, regardless of capacity, it is exempted from the
rule. Tire-burning facilities are exempted from the
performance standard but not re-cordkeeping requirements.
Small independent power producers, cogeneration facilities
and metals recovery facilities are not subject to MWC
standards.

   The regulation, simultaneously released as a direct final
rule and a proposed rule, takes effect Jan 29 unless
significant adverse comments are received by Jan. 18. For
more information call Walter Stevenson, emission standards
division, (919) 541-5264.

EPA CITES NPS FOR RCRA VIOLATIONS
AT HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK


   EPA is asking the National Park Service (NPS) to pay a
$243,800 penalty for allegedly storing hazardous wastes at
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park last year without the
required Resource Conservation & Recovery Act permit. The
wastes included acetone, chromium, lead, xylene, phenol,
arsenic, mercury and other substances generated by road
building, automotive maintenance and labs studying
volcanoes.
   NPS also was cited for storing wastes in containers that
were rusted or leaking despite having acceptable containers
on site which could have been used. The park removed the
containers with the waste in October 1995. EPA has ordered
the facility to develop a hazardous waste-management plan
within two months. It must include procedures ensuring that
all hazardous waste is moved off site shortly after it is
generated. For more information, contact EPA's Lois Grunwald
at (415) 744-1588.

EPA: HEALTH BENEFITS EXCEED COSTS
OF REDUCING ACID RAIN PRECURSORS


   The Clean Air Act's acid-rain provisions will provide
between $3 billion and $11 billion worth of health benefits
in 1997 to residents of 31 eastern states, according to an
assessment by EPA.

   The agency's report also says the value of health
benefits from reducing acid-rain precursors will be even
greater once the controls are fully in place by 2010. The
cost of complying with the acid-rain provisions are expected
to range from $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion in 2010, the
report adds.

   Sulfate aerosols comprise about 40 percent of inhalable
particulate matter in the eastern United States, according
to the report. Reductions in the number of new cases of
chronic bronchitis account for another 9 percent of the
health benefits, with other avoided problems accounting for
the remainder.

   EPA's Regional Acid Deposition Model provided the basis
for the report, which also used SO2 emission reductions
projected to occur under Title IV to estimate atmospheric
sulfate aerosol concentrations in the eastern United States
and Canada. This data were combined with 1990 Census data to
forecast population levels in portions of the two countries
where changes in sulfate levels are projected.

   The study used published epidemiology studies that link
certain health effects with sulfate level changes and
willingness-to-pay estimates published in economic
literature to put a value on changes in health, according to
EPA.

   The report was prepared by EPA's acid rain division as
part of an effort to estimate the total costs and benefits
of the Clean Air Act. To obtain a copy, call EPA's Acid Rain
Hotline at (202) 233-9620 or the Acid Rain Division's
homepage on the Internet at

EPA, ASIWPCA ISSUE DRAFT GUIDANCE
FOR EVALUATING NONPOINT PROGRAMS


   States would have nine major components upon which to
evaluate and upgrade their runoff pollution-control
programs, according to a draft guidance issued by EPA and an
association of state officials.

   The guidance allows states to review and revise their
programs to include:

Explicit short- and long-term goals for protecting surface
and ground waters.

A balance between statewide, nonpoint-source programs and
on-the-ground management of individual watersheds where
water bodies are polluted or threatened.

Abatement of water quality impairments from current sources
and possible future activities.

Identification of waters and watersheds polluted or
threatened by polluted runoff.

A review, upgrade and implementation of all program
components required under Section 319 of the Clean Water
Act.

Efficient and effective program management.

Strong working partnerships with appropriate groups.

Identification of federal lands and goals that are in
harmony with state program goals.

A feedback loop through which the state reviews, evaluates
and revises its nonpoint-source program and its management
every five years.

   A state that follows these requirements would be
considered a Tier I state and would be given more
flexibility than other states, the draft guidance says. EPA
would also provide states with the necessary technical and
financial assistance.

   The final guidance is slated for release in March 1996.
Comments are being sought through Jan. 19. The draft
guidance is available through the Internet at
http://www.epa.gov/owow. It also is available from the
Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control
Administrators at (202) 898-0905.

STATE OFFICIALS SEE HWIR PROPOSAL
COMPLICATING WASTE MANAGEMENT


   While some industry officials are cheering possible
exemptions of certain hazardous waste from strict management
requirements under the proposed Hazardous Waste
Identification Rule (HWIR), state management officials are
expecting their role to become more complicated.

   The self-implementing rule would require state officials
to conduct more sampling and inspecting at facilities to
ensure these businesses are complying with the rule, said
Jennifer Kaduck, chief of the hazardous waste branch for the
Georgia Environmental Protection Department. The proposal
sets concentration levels below which generators can manage
hazardous process waste constituents under Subtitle D of the
Resource Conservation & Recovery Act.

   The rule would be difficult to enforce, Kaduck said.
Although state agencies already have done much inspection
and sampling, HWIR will increase these responsibilities
considerably, she said. "We have an obligation to the
public" to ensure businesses are properly complying with the
rule, she said.

Many Questions Expected

   States also would have to consider the costs of adopting
the rule, according to Susan Ferguson, director of waste
policy for the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission. An overlooked upfront cost states would incur is
the time spent answering questions from the regulated
community, Ferguson said. The rule is self-implementing for
businesses, and companies are likely to ask about testing of
waste to determine the hazardous concentration, she said.

   The proposed rule (EW, Nov. 27, 1995, p. 451) also may
skew state funding, officials say. Many state agencies
receive federal funding based on the management of hazardous
waste, Ferguson said.

   State officials do not know how many businesses would
seek to remove waste from Subtitle C requirements through
the HWIR or how much of the waste stream would meet the new
exit level, Ferguson said. The levels are fairly low, and
treatment residue and wastewater possibly are the most
likely to exit Subtitle C. Ferguson said she hopes companies
will modify processes to limit the amount of listed
hazardous waste they generate.

   Some officials also are concerned about a section in the
rule's preamble asking for comments on a future proposal to
set contingent management exit levels for Department of
Energy mixed waste, Ferguson said. "States have not been
convinced by the data" showing mixed waste is safe in low
concentrations, she said. For more information, contact
Ferguson at (512) 239-5000 or Kaduck, at (404) 656-4713.

PHYSICIANS' GROUP SOUNDING ALERT
ABOUT DANGERS FROM AIR POLLUTION


   The American Medical Association's House of Delegates has
adopted policy resolutions urging doctors to inform the
public about air pollution's impact on the body, protecting
biological diversity and the dangers of the sun's
ultraviolet rays. The group based the recommendations on the
premise that "human health is inseparable from the health of
the natural world."

   Resolution 404 seeks to alert doctors, patients and the
public of damage to body organs and systems by indoor and
outdoor air pollution. Exposure to air pollutants occurs
through the lungs, skin and digestive tract, the resolution
states.

   John Kimball Scott, vice president of the National
Association of Physicians for the Environment, said that "it
is important to understand that pollution can affect not
only the lungs, but virtually every organ and system of the
body."

   Resolution 403 urges physicians to be aware of biological
diversity and its relationship to human health, especially
in terms of the development of drugs and biologicals derived
from plants, animals and other elements of the natural
world. Resolution 405 is intended to alert the public about
dangers from excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays in
advance of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.

GREENHOUSE 'CAR TALKS' REPORT URGES
BOOSTING CAFE STANDARD TO 45 MPG


   Raising the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)
standard to 45 miles per gallon is the single biggest step
that can be taken to slow global warning, according the
Clinton Administration's Policy Dialogue Advisory Committee
on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Personal Motor
Vehicles. Because the technology to raise CAFE to 45 mpg is
available, benefits from this step would be evident before
those produced by reduced driving and alternative fuels, the
"car talks" committee says.

   The recommendation is contained in an executive summary
issued by a majority of the committee, which was unable to
reach consensus following more than a year of discussions
among regulators, environmental advocacy groups and affected
industries such as automakers and oil companies. Although
the process stalemated, the committee majority said in its
Dec. 13 report that three key actions can be taken to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions: higher CAFE, reduced driving and
cleaner fuels.

Tire 'Feebates' Recommended

   Higher CAFE standards, plus research and development
support, should be implemented in 1998 to provide market
incentives, the summary says. Introducing "feebates" for low
rolling-resistance tires will also help fuel economy, it
adds.

   Recommended alternative fuels measures include supporting
further research and development for electric vehicles and
infrastructure; tax credits for natural gas vehicles and
infrastructure; more support for liquid biofuels research
and development; and production incentives for low-emitting
fuels.

   Driving-reduction steps include encouraging the equitable
shift of state and local road subsidies to cost-of-driving;
encouraging land-use away from auto dependency by improving
fixed-route and on-demand transit services plus bicycle and
pedestrian access; and reforming workplace parking-subsidy
programs.

   The committee majority contended that its suggestions are
needed if the United States is to meet its obligation under
the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Besides reducing
vehicle emissions, the suggestions should also reduce urban
smog and consumer expenditures, create jobs and eliminate
U.S. reliance on imported oil, the summary says. For a copy
of the report, contact Roni Lieberman of the Sierra Club at
(202) 675-7903.

EPA PROPOSES AIR PERMIT EXEMPTIONS
FOR SOME NON-MAJOR AREA SOURCES


   Chromium electroplaters, dry cleaners and commercial
sterilizers would benefit from amended EPA rules for new
area sources of hazardous air pollutants. A rule proposed
Dec. 13 would give these source categories a reprieve from
Clean Air Act operating permit requirements.

   Except in the case of Subpart X, the action proposes to
lift the requirement that these non-major sources obtain
Title V operating permits. An EPA amendment to Subpart X
confirms that existing non-major secondary lead smelting
facilities will still be subject to Title V permit rules.

   EPA says the purpose of the proposal is to reduce the
regulatory burden on states and local agencies, EPA regional
offices and industry "at a time when tremendous resources
are necessary for the initial implementation of the Title V
permit program."

   Regulatory agencies, overburdened by a backlog of permit
applications, will be unable to assist nonmajor sources,
forcing these small businesses to go through greater pains
to deal with the regulation. Loosening the permitting rule
will not affect a source's obligation to implement maximum
achievable control technology by the assigned date,
according to EPA.

   On a case-by-case basis, states will consider whether to
grant facility exemptions for perchlo-roethelyne from dry
cleaners, ethylene oxide from commercial sterilizers, hard
and decorative chromium electroplaters or anodizing tanks
and halogenated solvent cleaning. Only the standard for
halogenated solvent cleaning previously had a permitting
exemption. EPA decided to grant a permanent exemption from
permitting requirements to decorative chromium operations
that use either fume suppressants or trivalent chromium bath
technologies to reduce emissions.

   The exemptions would not apply to secondary lead smelters
because the agency judged that meeting permitting
requirements would not impose an "undue burden" on them.
There are only 16 secondary lead smelters, and five of these
are non-major sources, the proposal states. "Additionally,
the five non-major smelters are owned by relatively large
companies [that]...should be better equipped to handle the
Part 70 permitting process than the small businesses
characterizing the other source categories." Comments on the
proposal will be accepted through Jan. 12. For more
information, contact Lalit Banker of the emission standards
division, (919) 541-5420.

REFRIGERATOR MAKERS SETTLE LAWSUIT
OVER 'CFC-FREE' ADVERTISEMENTS


   Three manufacturers have agreed to change advertising
claims about ozone-depleting chemicals used in their
refrigerators to settle a California lawsuit brought by
three environmental advocacy groups.

   The lawsuit, Ozone Action v. Amana Refrigeration, (No.
973282) was filed in San Francisco Superior Court by
Environmental Law Foundation, Earth Day 2000, and Ozone
Action. It alleged that General Electric Co., Amana
Refrigeration Inc., and Whirl-pool Corp. and several
retailers were making false claims about so-called "CFC-
free" refrigerators in violation of California's "Green"
labeling law and Federal Trade Commission guidelines for
environmental marketing claims.

   The refrigerator manufacturers agreed to furnish stickers
to dealers stating the refrigerators contain HCFC-14b, a
known ozone depleting chemical, and to display store posters
listing the HCFC content of the refrigerators. The three
manufacturers, as part of the settlement announced Dec. 22,
also are making a $100,000 grant for further study of ozone
depletion.

   The suit said the "CFC-Free" ads, while true, were
misleading consumers into believing the refrigerators did
not harm the ozone layer. HCFCs contribute to ozone-layer
loss, but are a far smaller factor than CFCs. The
defendants, which included Sears Roebuck & Co., Circuit City
Inc., Montgomery Ward & Co. and Basic Living Products, said
they did not believe the advertising was misleading.

   In a separate action, the three environmental groups said
they and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group will sue
Maytag and Sony for allegedly failing to label their
refrigerators as containing CFCs-a designation required by
the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.

GREAT LAKES EFFORT COULD BE DAMAGED
BY GOP BUDGET CUTS, BROWNER SAYS


   The Republican-drafted EPA appropriations bill vetoed by
President Clinton may cost the Great Lakes initiative more
than $245 million in water quality funding, EPA
Administrator Carol Browner says.

   Browner issued the findings of an economic analysis
estimating costs and benefits of the final guidance issued
by EPA that sets water quality standards for the Great Lakes
area. She noted that EPA has made strides in the Great Lakes
cleanup over the past 25 years but that the fiscal 1996
spending bill threatens the Great Lakes effort.

   The bill also would limit EPA's ability to take
enforcement actions in the Great Lakes area, Browner said.
EPA and the Great Lakes states made more than 19,000
inspections and took more than 2,000 enforcement actions in
the eight-state area in 1994. "With the Republican budget,
the environmental cop would not be on the beat," she said.

   Great Lakes Superfund sites would also be hurt, according
to Browner, who said 434 sites in the area would not be
cleaned up because the bill "cuts funding of toxic waste
cleanup by 25 percent."

   The cost-benefit analysis that was performed on the area
justifies the potential costs of the Great Lakes initiative,
according to EPA. Three case studies of representative
communities were used for the analysis: the Fox River near
Green Bay, Wis.; the Saginaw River near Bay City, Mich.; and
the Black River near Cleveland.

   The analysis said the Fox River area would pay $3.6
million for water-quality improvements and receive benefits
worth $4.5 million, while the Saginaw River area would pay
$2.6 million and receive benefits worth $4 million. However,
the Black River area would pay $2.1 million and receive
benefits worth $900,000, according to the study.

   Copies of the Great Lakes reports are available by
calling (513) 489-8910. For more information on the
guidance, contact Jim Hanlon (202) 260-5400 or Mark Morris

CALIFORNIA'S AIR RESOURCES BOARD
MANDATES CLEANER-BURNING FUEL


   The California Air Resources Board has mandated that
cleaner-burning gasoline be sold statewide, a step officials
expect will reduce vehicular emissions by about 1 billion
pounds annually. The gasoline is produced by changing the
refinery process to reduce toxic compounds and sulfur
content of gasoline.

   Although the price of the gasoline cannot be predicted
because prices are dependant on market conditions, CARB
estimates that production costs will be between five and 15
cents a gallon.

   CARB officials says the new gasoline has undergone
extensive testing, with more than 800 cars driven more than
5 million miles. It will be available in the same octane
levels as the current gasoline. For more information, call
(800) 566-6655.


   CALIFORNIA-The San Diego Regional Water Quality Control
Board has refused to reduce two fines totaling $6.2 million
against the San Diego for sewage spill and treatment
violations. City officials offered $1.1 million toward a
proposed $3.7 million fine for a 1993 spill in Los
Penasquitos Lagoon and a separate $2.5 million fine for
inadequate sludge treatment. A senior deputy city attorney
said the city is negotiating with the regional board. San
Diego has gone to court seeking relief from the fine, and
Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell remanded the matter to
the board for a rehearing.

   COLORADO-Home Depot U.S.A. Inc., U.S. EPA and the state
have announced a prospective-purchaser agreement to resolve
potential liability claims and foster commercial property
development in Denver. The deal requires Home Depot to clean
up a portion of a Superfund site in exchange for agreement
by the governmental agencies not to sue it for liability.
The company also will operate and maintain the property to
ensure there will be no risk to the public health or
environment from past contamination. Home Depot plans a
store on the remediated site. Cleanup will be supervised by
the state Department of Public Health and Environment.

   DELAWARE-The Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Control has proposed a trading program for air
emissions. The proposal would allow industries to earn
credits for voluntarily reducing emissions of volatile
organic compounds or nitrogen oxides below levels set under
state regulations. If a facility exceeds the targeted levels
for emission reductions, 90 percent of the excess could be
banked, with the remainder retired to assure additional air-
quality improvements. A facility seeking to expand
operations could use its banked credits to offset additional
VOC or NOx emissions or buy credits from another facility at
whatever price it can negotiate. A program audit would be
conducted every three years, and public comment would be
solicited during the permit-approval process. Two public
hearings will be held this month, with final adoption of the
rules expected in April.

   MASSACHUSETTS-The legislature has authorized $100 million
in bonds to continue state hazardous site cleanups. A $60
million fund that has paid for cleanups since 1987 had
fallen to $150,000 when the House passed the reauthorization
bond. The state had halted cleanup at 73 sites and had
expected to close down the remaining remediation operations.
Contractors are working again on all state cleanup
activities, a state official said. For more information,
contact Te Leone at (617) 292-5845.

   NEW JERSEY-Auto emissions testing is being threatened by
Republican leaders in the Assembly. Assembly Speaker Garabed
Haytaian and Majority Leader Jack Collins have said they are
willing to make changes in the law to respond to public
concerns about the program. The testing has become
controversial because other states are bailing out of the
federally mandated program and because of publicity that
claimed the law would lead the state to confiscate cars. The
law regulating testing, passed just five months ago,
requires owners of vehicles that fail the test to correct
problems. Both lawmakers have said there is enough time to
make changes because the program is not scheduled to start
until 1997.

   TEXAS-The Border Environmental Cooperation Commission has
approved a $11.7 million waste water treatment and reuse
project for El Paso. BECC, a bilateral body arising from the
North American Free Trade Agreement, will certify additional
projects at its next meeting. They are expected to include a
$40 million wastewater treatment plant in Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico; a $1 million wastewater treatment plant in
Matamoros, Mexico; a $7.8 million tire recycling project in
Mexicali, Mexico; a $52 million water distribution and
treatment project in Nogales, Mexico; a $770,000 water
supply and waste water treatment plant in Naco, Mexico; a
$118 million urban development and environmental improvement
project in Rio Tijuana, Mexico; a $2.7 million upgrading
plan for a wastewater treatment plant in Somerton, Calif.;
and a $2 million upgrading plan for a water system in
Douglas, Ariz.

AGING DNEPR RIVER HYDRO PROJECTS
THREATEN MANY AREAS OF UKRAINE


   Decrepit Soviet-built hydroelectric works along the Dnepr
River are putting vast areas of Ukraine at risk of flooding,
according to an group of international experts. The group
warns that excessively high water levels may cause the sand
and soil foundation of the Kakhovka Reservoir to collapse.

   The failure of this dam would release a 20-30 meter high
wave moving at 130 km. per hour, capable of destroying some
cities and hundreds of towns in the Kherson, Odessa, Crimea
and Nikolayev regions, the authors of the study document
said.

   Chemicals, oil products and waste contained in the
reservoir would create an environmental disaster, destroying
soil in the Dnepr Basin and life in the Black Sea and
irreparably damaging coastal areas and resorts on the Azov
and Black seas. Vasyl Durdynets, Ukraine's minister for
state security and emergencies, said the government is aware
of the consequences of a disaster and will submit a plan for
the safe functioning of the Dnepr reservoirs to the
government's commission on environmental safety.


   AUSTRALIA-The nation has withheld endorsement of three
Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development
environmental resolutions, surprising observers who expect
environmentally friendly actions from Australia. The main
blockage is over binding resolutions to extend to non-member
countries mutual acceptance of data and guidelines for
chemical testing. Australia also has reservations about
guidelines on setting up a pollutant release and transfer
registry modeled on the U.S. Toxic Release Inventory.
Another source of discord may concern the "greening" of
government operations. Contact: Bill Long, OECD, (+33 1) 45
24 8200.

   CANADA-British Columbia has adopted Canada's most
rigorous new-vehicle emission standards. They are aimed at
reducing pollution at least 50 percent by 2010 and 70
percent by 2020 in the southwest corner of the province. The
law stipulates that by 1998, all cars sold in British
Columbia will have to meet U.S. emissions standards, which
are stricter than Canada's. By 2001, all new vehicles sold
in the province will have to be certified under "California"
standards and emit on average 70 percent less of certain
pollutants than current vehicles, if they are to sold in the
province. The standards also mandate that zero-emission
vehicles comprise 10 percent of the market by 2003. Contact:
Environment Canada, (819) 997-2800.

   CHILE-The Ministry of Mining says government and private
sector actions against air pollution will bring mining
operations and smelters up to U.S. and European standards by
2000. Technical requirements to set emission levels and
other standards should be passed by next June, and existing
decrees aimed at specific pollutants have already affected
mining, ministry official say. Large sources such as copper
producers Codelco and ENAMI, are said to be committed to
becoming more environmentally responsible. Contact: Janet
Maritano, Ministry of Mining; (+56 2) 696-5872.

   ECUADOR-Fundacion Jatun Sacha has acquired 4,000 acres of
wet forest, with the goal of preserving the last 0.8 percent
of land in western Ecuador. It describes the land as having
the world's richest biodiversity. The group says it needs
12,500 acres to adequately protect life forms but is
competing with a logging company that is eyeing the entire
area. Contact: World Parks Endowment, 1616 P St. NW, #200,
Washington, DC 20036; (202) 939-3808.

   JAPAN-The Ministry of International Trade and Industry
has asked private businesses to prepare new voluntary anti-
pollution plans to conform with ISO 14000 environmental-
management standards. MITI's directive also promotes
recycling, non-polluting vehicles, measures to reduce air,
water, soil and noise pollution and alternative energy
sources, including solar power.

   NEPAL-This Himalayan nation and the European Union have
agreed to improve environmental cooperation. The accord, the
first between the E.U. and Nepal, calls for the creation of
a permanent mechanism for facilitating communication on
environmental and other issues.

   NEW ZEALAND/AUSTRALIA-A cooperative waste program
announced at the 10th bilateral Environment and Conservation
Council creates an "interim biogeographical regionalization"
of the two nations to identify shortcomings in national
wildlife protection. The governments will create a
comprehensive mechanism for protecting natural areas.

   SOUTH KOREA-Seoul has decided not to build a nuclear
waste repository on Kulop Island because two fault lines
were located about two miles away, the Environment Ministry
has announced. The facility was to store up to 1 million
drums of waste. South Korea now has no specific site to
store waste from its 10 nuclear power plants. Five more
plants are under construction. Contact: Environmental
Attache, South Korean Embassy, (202) 939-6463.

VOLKSWAGEN JOINS THE RACE FOR FIRST COMMERCIALLY VIABLE ELECTRIC CAR

Volkswagen AG has plans to unleash an electric vehicle
called the Chico car by the end of 1993.

The company has just developed a computerized system that will
greatly assist in mass producing the vehicle.  Volkswagen hopes that
the Chico will put it in the front-running position of the newly
developing electric car market.

ITALIAN CHEMICAL CO. INTRODUCES NEW, CLEANER DIESEL FUEL

Diesel-Bi is the name of a clean diesel fuel produced in part from
vegetable oils and methanol.  An Italian company, Novamont, based in
Milan and a subsidiary of the Ferruzzi-Montedison Group, will begin
field testing the fuel this month in South Dakota.

The company has worked closely for two years with Senator Thomas
Daschle (D-SD) who hosted a March 28 ceremony to inaugurate the field
tests.  A company spokesman said Ferruzzi is seeking eventual EPA
approval of the product so that it can be commercially sold in the
U.S.  Testing will take place in the EPA-certified laboratory in
Sioux Falls, and data from these tests along with other company tests
will be compared to 1993 and '94 clean diesel emissions standards
adopted in California.

Diesel-Bi is made of 90 percent vegetable oil and 10 percent methanol
that is "combined in the presence of a catalyst to produce a methyl
ester," a company official said.  Ethanol could be used, but methanol
is preferred by the company as more price competitive.

Palm, sunflower, soya and other oils can be used to produce
Diesel-Bi.  In Europe, canola is the feedstock most commonly used.
Some test results have shown that sulphur emissions have been
eliminated and particulates and carbon monoxide have been reduced up
to 50 percent.  The fuel can also be used in combination with
traditional diesel fuel.

Ferruzzi began his work on Diesel-Bi about two years ago and held the
first field tests in Zurich last summer.  Two buses in Sioux Falls
are scheduled to operate solely on the fuel for four months.

CHINA MOVES TOWARD VISION OF GIANT HYDRO DAM, DISPLACING 1.3 MILLION

The dream of damming the flood-prone Yangtze, which captivated Mao
Zedong in the 50's, is moving toward realization.

Everything about the project is enormous.  It will generate 84
billion kilowatts of hydroelectric power per year by 2008.  The l85-
meter-high dam will be the biggest hydropower station in the world,
as well as the world's largest ship-lift.  The price: an estimated
$l0.5 billion.

But the human cost will be equally enormous.  Some 1.3 million people
will be displaced from 140 towns (some with populations of over
l00,000) and countless villages.  Also lost will be 58,800 acres of
arable land, 159 smaller power stations, and 675 factories.

Resistance is so strong, particularly from small farmers, that a
third of the deputies to the National People's Congress, usually a
rubber-stamping body for government decisions, voted against it.

Adding to the tension is an inequality of benefits.  Sichuan
province, with 85 percent of the people to be displaced, stands to
receive only l0 percent of the power generated.  It will also face a
heightened risk of flooding.

Critics worry about the risk of the reservoir, induced earthquakes
and river bank collapses.  They also contend that the rapid
accumulation of silt will wipe out much of the gains in generating
capacity.

The dam will be financed through bonds, preferential foreign loans,
state funds, and power generation (expected to start nine years after
construction is begun).

LOS ANGELES SET TO ADD 150 MEGA-WATT GEOTHERMAL COMPLEX

Los Angeles joins the China Lake Naval Weapons Center at Coso, CA in
tapping local geothermal energy. The Los Angeles Department of Water
& Power (DWP) has awarded a contract for a nearby 150-megawatt power
complex to Calpine Corporation, which built the Navy's plant there
five years ago.

The Los Angeles DWP will lease a site from the Weapons Center, 200
miles north of the city.  Calpine, builder of both plants, also
maintains and operates the Navy's geothermal facility.

No figures have been divulged, but observers estimate the cost at
about $200 million.

SLANTS AND TRENDS


   GOOD BUDGET NEWS - Researchers and health officials
working on lead issues received good news Jan. 5 when
Congress passed a bill that will fund the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) through Sept. 30, the end of
the fiscal year. This means NIH and CDC now can disperse
grants and carry out disease surveillance and other
programs. NIH received $11.9 billion, a 5.7 percent increase
over its fiscal 1995 budget. CDC, which supports a variety
of lead education and other programs, was essentially flat-
funded at $2.1 billion. The two agencies were the only ones
to be fully funded, although the targeted appropriations
measure (H.R. 1358) also allocated money for specific
federal programs such as Black Lung benefit payments. H.R.
1358, however, does not clearly define how NIH should divide
the appropriations among its 24 institutes, centers and
divisions. The House intended for the institutes to be
funded at levels close to those detailed in H.R. 2127, which
the House passed Aug. 4, committee staff said. But NIH may
be able to make some adjustments, staff said, adding the
White House Office of Management and Budget is reviewing the
question.

   However, EPA and the Occupational Health and Safety
Administration (OSHA) were not so lucky. Separate continuing
resolutions (H.R. 1643 and H.J. Res. 134) sent employees
back to work but allocated funds only through Jan. 26.
Republican Whip Sen. Trent Lott (Miss.) said Jan. 10 the GOP
will not force a third government shutdown. Instead,
Congress likely will pass targeted appropriations. "We'll
fund the programs we think are important, and we won't fund
programs we don't think important," said House Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-Ohio Jan. 14. EPA and OSHA
consistently have been targets of the GOP's frustration with
government. "[T]he Republican leadership does not care about
EPA; does not care about consumer protection; does not care
about OSHA...Corporate interests are going to have a field
day," said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), referring to the
omission of these programs from the recent targeted
appropriations.


   LOOPHOLE NEARLY CLOSED - Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge (R)
is pushing to close a regulatory loophole benefiting
asbestos-removal companies that has long frustrated state
officials. Of the five states in the Environmental
Protection Agency's Region III, Pennsylvania is the only one
with no method to target and prosecute unscrupulous
contractors, said John Curries, spokesman for the state
Department of Labor and Industry (L&I). Pennsylvania began
the effort in 1990 when the state legislature created an
advisory committee made up of government, academic and
industry representatives to determine whether the state
should enact a licensing system. The committee endorsed the
idea and in April 1995, the L&I drafted language to turn the
recommendation into law. Ridge plans to approve the plan and
seek a legislative sponsor.

COSTLY RULE SETS MACT STANDARDS
FOR NEWER MUNICIPAL INCINERATORS


   Newer municipal waste combustors (MWCs) will be required
to install a combination of high-efficiency pollution-
control equipment starting Jan. 29, if an EPA final rule
does not draw significant negative comments. While the rule
enables EPA to reduce several pollutants, including lead,
simultaneously, it is expected to impose substantial capital
costs.

   The maximum achievable control technology standard will
affect existing and new MWCs capable of combusting more than
35 metric tons daily. It establishes emissions limits for
dioxins, furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter,
hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and
fugitive ash. Stricter performance standards apply to MWCs
with capacities greater than 225 metric tons a day.

   The rule, published in the Dec. 19 Federal Register,
mandates that MWCs built after Sept. 20, 1994, or modified
after June 19, 1996, will be subject to new, more stringent
performance standards. MWCs built between Dec. 20, 1989 and
Sept. 20, 1994, or modified before June 19, 1996, will
remain subject to MWC performance standards for plants built
after the 1989 date. This provision was promulgated Feb. 11,
1991. The dates were set to avoid same MWC plants being
subject to overlapping rules.

   EPA says there are about 307 operating MWC units at 128
plants, providing a total combustion capacity of 94,000
metric tons per day. It says that 179 MWCs will be affected
by the rule; about 100 are publicly owned. Costs for the
updated standard exceed those for the 1991 standard by $156
million for capital investment and by $43 million for annual
operations. Total capital costs from investments mandated by
both rules approach $780 million, or an added $13 per metric
ton of solid waste combusted.

   The agency says the benefits include annual emissions
greater than the 1991 rule: 3,000 fewer metric tons of SO2
and 4,000 fewer metric tons of hydrogen chloride. For most
categories there is less than a 10 percent improvement, but
for mercury, the new standard will eliminate 200 percent of
the amount removed by the 1991 rule. In total, the rule
expects to reduce emissions of several hazardous air
pollutants by about 110,000 tons per year, EPA says.

   If a facility combusts less than 10 metric tons per day
of solid waste, regardless of capacity, it is exempted from
the rule. Tire-burning facilities are exempted from the
performance standard but not recordkeeping requirements. And
small independent-power producers, cogeneration facilities
and metals recovery facilities are not subject to the MWC
standards.

   The regulation, simultaneously released as a direct final
rule and a proposed rule, takes effect Jan 29 unless
significant adverse comments are received by Jan. 18. For
more information call Walter Stevenson, emission standards
division, (919) 541-5264.

OSHA PROVIDES GUIDANCE SOFTWARE
ON AGENCY'S ASBESTOS STANDARDS


   Customized guidance on compliance with Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards on
asbestos is available for free from the agency.

   The OSHA Asbestos Advisor - interactive computer software
that can provide building owners, contractors, consultants
and others with quick answers to technical questions about
complying with the standards - is available from the
Department of Labor electronic bulletin board, LABOR NEWS
and the Compliance Assistance Section of the OSHA home page
on the internet World Wide Web.

   "This powerful new tool is another example of how OSHA is
using technology to make compliance with worker protections
easier," said OSHA Administrator Joseph Dear. "Not only will
it help improve compliance, it should be a great help to
employers in reducing costs."

   In addition to being on the Internet, the Asbestos
Advisor will be added to the next edition of OSHA's CD-ROM,
which can be purchased through the Government Printing
Office.

   The program can be accessed through the OSHA web page at
http://www.osha.gov/. It also is available from LABOR NEWS
at (202) 219-4784. For more information, contact: Edward

LBP STUDIES POINT TO LACK OF RESEARCH
ON DANGERS FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS


   State and federal officials are not sufficiently
protecting construction workers from the hazardous effects
of lead-based paint (LBP), according to two studies. Each
report recommends officials pay greater attention to worker
safety as infrastructure repair work is performed on steel
structures and bridges.

   The two LBP studies were conducted separately by the
Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning and by the New York
State Department of Health in conjunction with the Mount
Sinai Medical Center.

   Years of neglect and oversight have resulted in an
increased effort on infrastructure repair, Deborah Nagin,
industrial hygienist and researcher with the New York
Department of Health, told the annual convention of the
American Public Health Association (APHA). She said more
than 90 percent of these bridges and structures needing
repair are coated with LBP.

   In addition, state and federal authorities provide
minimal protection for workers who must repaint and repair
steel structures and bridges containing LBP, said Pierre
Erville, director of environmental and housing policy for
the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, also speaking
at the APHA convention. The alliance is taking an active
interest in worker safety because it believes inadequate
safety practices on the job can spread lead contamination to
others.

Widespread State Effort Needed

   The two research efforts analyzed worker safety standards
in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland,
Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas and Washington.
Erville's alliance targeted the scientific procedures used
to prevent lead exposure, the rate of infrastructure repair
and the state of current occupational lead poisoning
prevention procedures.

   Only five states - Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York,
New Jersey and Maryland - have passed specific legislation
to protect workers from lead exposure, Erville said. He
pointed specifically to New York transportation authorities,
who require detailed reports on medical testing for workers
exposed to lead from contract bidders and who also require a
lead exposure control plan. The result of these protections
are that contractors bidding on construction projects will
not attempt to underbid a contract and then make up for the
financial loss by ignoring health and risk prevention
programs.

   Because most states do not have specific legislative
requirements on worker protection, the U.S. Department of
Transportation should take the lead in educating and
training state authorities on the risks of lead exposure,
Erville said. One method he suggested is a system where
contractors who bid on projects gather for "pre-bidding"
conferences where the specific level of lead content is made
known to help contractors make accurate bids and prepare for
the necessary level of worker protection.

   Erville also called upon state officials to: explicitly
list lead poisoning prevention provisions in their
contracts; consult with industrial hygienists with lead
prevention expertise; and ensure a level of contractor
training and worker training programs are developed and
implemented. He also urged that contractors be required to
establish a worker blood-lead level reporting system to be
submitted to state officials.

   Following up on that point, Nagin said many of these
types of requirements already exist. The specifics of the
rules and regulations, however, vary widely among states,
she said.

HAZWASTE-BURNING CEMENT KILN WAS
SOURCE OF LEAD IN BLOOD, STUDY SAYS


   A hazardous waste-burning cement kiln in Alpena, Mich.,
contributed 75 percent of the lead found in the blood of
nearby residents, according to researchers with Rutgers
University.

   In 18 of the 24 residents living near Lafarge Corp. and
whose blood was sampled, the levels of lead in blood were
the result of exposure from the cement kiln dust. The blood-
lead levels in most of the residents were under the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention's warning level of 10
micrograms per deciliter (ug/dl), though one resident showed
blood-lead levels of 11.87 ug/dl.

   The researchers said they aimed to trace where the lead
came from rather than the levels of lead the exposure
caused. The Association for Responsible Thermal Treatment -
a trade group of commercial hazardous waste incinerators who
compete with cement kilns in the waste burning market -
sponsored the study, performed by Gene Hall in Rutger's
chemistry department.

Seven Households Sampled

   The researchers used samples of people living in seven
households close to the Lafarge facility, with one other
household located farther away from the plant used as a
control. The study also collected samples of cement kiln
dust at Lafarge and samples of paint, tap water and house
dust from the sample households.

   Currently, cement kiln operators are allowed to store
piles of dust anywhere on their property. The Rutgers
conclusions could take on added importance as EPA still is
contemplating how and if cement kiln dust will be regulated.
In 1994, EPA sent a report to Congress recommending that in
some circumstances, cement kiln dust could be regulated
under Subtitle C regulations in the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA).

   Most hazardous waste incinerators are fully permitted
under RCRA, with incinerator ash considered a hazardous
waste to be disposed of in Subtitle C landfills with triple
liners, ground water monitoring requirements and leachate
controls. EPA currently is working to unify emission limits
for hazardous waste incinerators and boilers and industrial
furnaces, which include cement kilns. A proposed rule that
accomplishes such a goal now is being reviewed by the White
House Office of Management and Budget.

BALTIMORE RESIDENTS FILE LAWSUIT OVER
FORTHCOMING LEAD-PAINT REGULATIONS


   Three Baltimore residents filed a class action suit this
month in a challenge against Maryland state lead-paint
regulations slated to take effect next month. The suit
argues the regulation favors landlords and will result in
child poisoning.

   The suit calls for an injunction prohibiting the Maryland
Department of the Environment from implementing and
enforcing its lead-paint removal and cleanup regulations,
which were adopted in November 1994 and scheduled to begin
Feb. 24. When passed, the law sought to prevent childhood
lead poisoning while being sensitive to the state's
decreasing supply of affordable housing. Disputes and
disagreements between childrens' advocates and property
owner representatives over how to implement the bill have
stalled it thus far.

   Joseph Espo, an attorney to the tenants who filed the
suit, said the way the forthcoming law is structured,
landlords would get immunity from lawsuits in the event a
child was poisoned in the lead abatement effort. Officials
from the Maryland Department of the Environment and the
Property Owners Association of Greater Baltimore declined to
comment on the suit. D. Robert Enten, with the Property
Owners Association, did say, however, that the legislation
in question seeks to strike a balance between the business
community, the maintenance of affordable housing and the
prevention of child lead poisoning.

   Landlords are willing to combat the lead problem, but
they also want protection from increasing numbers of
lawsuits filed by former tenants who claim their children
were poisoned. The property owners say this litigation will
soon drive them out of business with any controls.

   Under the bill, owners of pre-1950 rental housing must
reduce lead-poisoning risks on their properties by removing
and repainting surfaces that are flaking and peeling paint.
In return, the landlords would be immune from lawsuits if
any children living on the property become poisoned.

   The bill require landlords to follow some safety
precautions during abatement, and tenants may be forced to
vacate the unit while work is done. At issue, however, are
exemptions to the safety requirements when doing electrical
or plumbing work, or if repairs are performed on a painted
space in a room less than 25 square feet.
Fat Intake Could Increase Blood-Lead
Absorption in Children, Study Shows

   Children exposed to lead will absorb less of it if they
eat less fat, a new study suggests. Certain nutrients have
long been known to affect the rate at which the body takes
up lead, which can retard children's development, lower
their IQs and damage their hearing, according to
researchers.

   In a study of 296 inner-city preschoolers, 9 months to 3
years old, the researchers found that those with high levels
of fat in their diet were more likely to have dangerous
levels of lead in their blood. Dietary calcium and iron are
known to block lead absorption, but the effects of many
other nutrients have not been explored. The researchers also
learned that poor children are the most likely to be
exposed.

   The researchers said if further study supports their
findings, it "would further strengthen the recommendation of
a low-fat diet as a healthy one for children." Federal
health officials recommend no restrictions on fats for
children under 2 because it might harm their growth.

   Lead levels among the children ranged from 1 to 55
micrograms per tenth of a liter of blood, and averaged about
11. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says
anything above 10 can cause lead poisoning in children. The
quantities of fat in the children's diets were not
estimated; the researchers used only relative intakes based
on questions asked of parents.

Calories May Increase Absorption

   The study also found that higher levels of calories - not
just fat - were associated with higher lead absorption.
However, this point is disputed by a longtime lead
researcher, who expressed doubt that higher calorie intake
is linked to higher lead absorption.

   Kim Dietrich, a developmental psychologist at the
University of Cincinnati School of Medicine who has studied
lead for 15 years, said lead is more readily absorbed on an
empty stomach. That is one reason doctors see higher lead
levels among poor children, he said. He agreed, however,
that higher fat consumption is related to higher lead
levels, possibly because the fat increases absorption of
lead in the intestine.

   The research was led by Susan Lucas of the Department of
Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at the University of
Maryland School of Medicine. The findings are reported in
the January issue of the journal Pediatrics, published by
the American Academy of Pediatrics.

   Lucas warned children can be exposed to lead through
dust, dirt and drinking water, along with toys and houses
painted before 1975, the last year lead-based paint was
used. Water can be contaminated if it flows through lead
pipes, and children may eat paint flakes or inhale or lick
lead dust, which tastes sweet.

BLOOD-LEAD MONITOR IN CONNECTICUT
MAY BE APPLIED WITHIN OTHER STATES


   A program to monitor levels of lead in blood in
Connecticut that also includes worker protection measures
has been so successful in lowering blood-lead levels that
efforts are underway to expand the program to other states,
according to a report in the Dec. 15 issue of Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report, published by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

   The program, the Connecticut Road Industry Surveillance
Project (CRISP), began in 1990 in an effort to reduce lead
exposure, contamination and toxicity in bridge workers in
the state. In order to comply with the program, contracts
must carry health and safety language, and medical
management of workers with centralized data reporting and
intervention is required.

   The CDC report shows, by contrast, that blood-lead levels
continue to afflict bridge workers even in states with
regulatory lead requirements and workplace safety and health
standards. Among bridge workers from eight states, a quarter
had levels of blood lead above 40 micrograms of lead per
deciliter of blood.

   Connecticut, however, had only 2 percent of workers with
elevated blood-lead levels, which owes to the state's worker
protection measures incorporated into road construction
contracts, the CDC report said.

DAMNING DOCUMENTS SINK OCF
AS FIRM'S APPEAL FALLS SHORT


   Documents are critical to successful litigation against
asbestos manufacturers. The paper trail often leads to the
all-important answers to the questions of what did the
company know of the dangers of their product and when they
knew it.

   A case in point concerns asbestos giant Owens-Corning
Fiberglass Corp. (OCF), which recently appealed a judgment
by arguing in vain that the trial court should have excluded
damaging documents about the company. Three men who suffered
asbestos-related diseases after exposure to OCF products
received a total of $3 million in compensatory damages and
$500,000 each in punitive damages due to the company's
failure to warn them of asbestos' hazards.

   The documents that led to the verdict included since-
declassified Navy reports from World War II detailing the
dangers of asbestos as well as internal OCF communications.
In its appeal, OCF said the court improperly admitted these
documents. OCF argued the Navy reports should have been
excluded from trial because - as classified documents - the
company could not have known the findings they contained.

   As for the company memoranda, OCF said the plaintiffs had
altered their copies to highlight damaging statements to
inflame the jury. However, the Texas Court of Appeals in
Houston Jan. 4 rejected OCF's argument, saying the company
had access to the same information in the Navy reports and
knew the contents of its own corporate memoranda.

Navy Documents Admitted

   The court also noted that, in a failure-to-warn case,
what the company knows of its product's dangers is sometimes
less relevant than what other experts in the field know. "It
does not matter whether a manufacturer was aware of
information regarding the dangers of asbestos use at the
time of exposure and marketing because an asbestos
manufacturer is charged with the duty to know the dangers of
asbestos products," the court ruled. "If the dangers of
asbestos were known by other manufacturers or by the Navy at
or before the time of the plaintiffs' exposure, the same
risks were scientifically discoverable by OCF."

   In any event, the internal OCF documents introduced at
trial indicated OCF had information - at about the same time
the Navy did - on the hazards of asbestos, the court said.
"As early as the 1940s, OCF had in its files documentation
about shipyard insulation workers who had developed
asbestosis," the court said. "It had copies of public health
bulletins about the effect of inhalation of asbestos dust.
In letters to OCF, doctors conducting tests on Fiberglass
repeatedly made reference to the dangers of asbestos."

   OCF cited markings on the plaintiff's exhibit and argued
the trial court had improperly admitted into evidence
doctored copies. However, the Texas appeals court agreed
with the trial court that the markings - if indeed the
plaintiff made them - were harmless.

Court Admits Photocopies

   "The documents about which OCF complains are
photocopies," the appeals court said. "OCF does not assert
that the photocopies do not accurately reproduce the
originals; instead, it complains about marks made on
duplicates after reproduction .... However, we have reviewed
the documents and we agree that the markings on the
documents are not significant."

   The Navy report and OCF documents were only a sampling of
the documents the plaintiffs brought to trial on asbestos.
Much of the damning evidence that had been allowed at trial
was struck from the record before jury deliberations. For
example, the plaintiffs introduced the testimony of a Dr.
Irving Selikoff at an Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) hearing in 1984. "The asbestos disease
disaster which we now face largely unsuccessfully bears
witness to our failures," Selikoff said. "We have
consistently greatly underestimated or ignored warnings of
disease and death."

   Saying the testimony should have been excluded as
hearsay, the trial judge told the jury to disregard
Selikoff's testimony before OSHA. OCF urged the judge to
declare a mistrial, arguing there was no way for the jury to
ignore such testimony. The judge rejected the company's
request, and the appeals court agreed that the instruction
to the jury to ignore the testimony was sufficient. [Owens-
Corning Fiberglass Corp. v. Malone, 1996 WL 3563

NEWSBRIEFS


   Paint Contamination Control - The Institute of
Environmental Sciences seeks voting members for Working
Group (WG-029) in its Contamination Control Division, which
is writing a Recommended Practice (RP) on "Contamination
Control Considerations in Paint Spray Applications." A
"home-stretch" draft will be issued for discussion at the
institute's annual technical meeting May 12-17, in Orlando,
Fla. The RP is intended to provide guidelines for controlled
paint spray environments and related operations. The goal is
to establish a uniform basis for describing, procuring,
operating and testing as these relate to paint and coatings,
air handling, surface cleaning and preparation, paint-
related consumables, personnel garment systems and related
laundering, facility cleaning, paint-delivery systems, and
environmental considerations. "The diversification of
backgrounds and experience in the working group membership
has been a key element," said Charles Berndt, working group
chair. "The cross-pollination of ideas that are brought to
the table...has led to the quick progress on this RP." For
more information, call the Institute of Environmental
Sciences, (708) 255-1561.

   Demolishing Suit - A couple living in Arapahoe County,
Colo., have filed a lawsuit in district court saying
asbestos particles were blown over their home during
demolition of a building located next to them. Kathleen
Collins and Theodore Singer named FTSC Partnership,
developer of the Polo Reserve now being constructed in place
of the building; Randall & Blake Inc., the demolition firm;
and the city of Littleton, Colo., which the suit says
permitted the demolition. Singer and Collins argue in their
suit that a crew demolished the building in June during
windy weather. The incident threatened the couple's health
and caused emotional distress, the suit said.


   Lead Contract Award - Versar Inc., Sprinfield, Va., was
awarded with three contracts with a combined potential value
of $1.5 million. The contracts include a $600,000 two-year
contract with the Federal Highway Administration to assess
containment efficiency in environmental exposure from lead
paint removal and maintenance on bridges. The second
contract, worth $700,000, is to provide a variety of
infrastructure deism services to Leigh City, Utah. The third
contract, for $100,000, was with the state of California's
Division of State Architect Seismic upgrade program.


   Quality Control - The American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) is preparing to release a draft standard
for institutions to use for certifying environmental
professionals. Once the standard is approved, only about 25
percent of the nation's approximately 130 credentialing
institutions are expected to pass muster. The credentialing
guidelines, the result of nearly two years of work, will be
circulated to members of ASTM's subcommittee on
environmental credentialing and ultimately to all ASTM
members. The model for the standards effort is the Council
of Engineering and Scientific Study Boards, said Anthony
Buonicore, chairman of the task force developing the
standards. The draft standard states it "does not propose to
address any specific certification program for environmental
professionals." It does, however, specify criteria for
credentialing organizations. Contact: ASTM, (215) 299-5400.


   Directory - The National Conference of State Legislators
(NCSL) has issued a new listing of who in the states is
leading various lead-poisoning prevention activities. Lead
Poisoning Prevention: Directory of State Contacts costs $20
plus shipping, and can be ordered through NCSL's Marketing
Department: (303) 830-2200.

New Instrumentation Detects Toxic Gases

GMD Systems, Inc. (Old Route 519, Hendersonville, PA 15339; Tel
412/746-3600 or 800/736-4666, Fax 412/746-1359) has commercialized
its Remote Intelligent Sensor (RIS) for the detection of toxic
gases such as hydrazines, phosgene, and isocyanates.  William T.
Hughes, Product Manager, told us that the RIS is a highly accurate,
single point, fixed position area monitor expandable into a network
of up to 120 sensors connected by a 2-way communications link, and
computer-supervised from a central location.  Since each RIS also
retains "stand alone" capability, the units can continue to operate
during power outages or computer failures.  The RIS employs a
quick-response, microprocessor-controlled sensing system that uses
a combination of colorimetric paper tape, cassettes, and electro-
optics.  GMD is an affiliate of Bacharach, Inc. (625 Alpha Drive,
Pittsburgh, PA 15238; Tel 412/963-2000, Fax 412/963-2091).

Sierra Monitor Gas Sensors Employ Four Sensing Technologies

Sierra Monitor Corporation (SMC, 1991 Tarob Court, Milpitas, CA
95035; Tel 408/262-6611, Fax 408/262-9042) offers 4 sensor
technologies to match the best gas sensor performance with
application requirements.  Catalytic bead sensors are used to
monitor combustible gases.  The sensor provides reliable zero
stability and a linear response to combustible gas over a wide
temperature range.  The sensor consists of 2 alumina beads each
surrounding a platinum wire operating at approximately 450 C.  One
bead is passivated so it will not react with combustible gas.  The
other bead is catalyzed to promote a reaction with combustible gas.
Effects of changes in ambient temperature and relative humidity are
nullified by placing the two beads in separate legs of a wheatstone
bridge circuit.  When the catalyzed bead reacts with the
combustible gas, it heats up, which increases its resistance.
This, in turn, increases the output of the wheatstone bridge
circuit used as the sensor signal.

Stephen R. Ferree, Vice President - Marketing, told us that SMC's
semiconductor sensors have a resistance in air which is affected by
oxygen adsorbed on the surface of the sensor.  Oxygen atoms capture
electrons on the semiconductor surface, thereby increasing its
resistance.  The sensors may be impregnated with dopants such that,
when the sensor's resistance changes, specific gases displace the
adsorbed oxygen.  For example, SMC's thin film metal oxide sensor
does not respond when exposed to 5% methane in air.  Other
semiconductor sensors are available for combustible gases, carbon
monoxide, and ammonia.

Electrochemical sensors are fuel cell-like devices consisting of an
anode, cathode, and electrolyte.  The components of the cell are
selected so that a subject gas allowed to diffuse into the cell
will cause a chemical reaction and generate a current.  The cells
are diffusion limited so the rate at which the gas enters the cell
is solely dependent on the gas concentration.  The current
generated is proportional to the rate of consumption of the subject
gas in the cell.  Unlike electrochemical sensors, where gas
diffuses through membranes into the cell, SMC sensors allow gas to
diffuse into the sensor through a simple capillary.  The result is
a stable sensor with low pressure and temperature coefficients and
the capability to measure gas as a % by volume.

In SMC infrared (IR) sensors, gas molecules absorb IR light within
a narrow, characteristic wavelength.  Light is emitted from an IR
source and passed through the gas to be analyzed.  The amount of
absorption corresponds directly to the gas concentration.

SMC gas sensor modules condition the sensor signal and provide an
industry standard 4-20 mA output that can interface with single-
and multiple-channel controllers and distributed control systems.
Gases monitored by SMC modules include ammonia, carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, chlorine, combustible gases, hydrogen, hydrogen
sulfide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, oxygen, and sulfur
dioxide.

HNU Systems Uses Photoionization to Measure Gases

HNU Systems, Inc. (160 Charlemont St., Newton, MA 02161-9987; Tel
617/964-6690 800/724-5600, Fax 617/558-0056) Model 201 continuous
gas monitors allow the long term monitoring of volatile organic
compounds (VOC's).  Brian Sheppard, National Sales Manager, told us
that the instruments are suited for the continuous measurement of
process streams, stack gas, or ambient air.  They use the
photoionization detection principle, which provides measurements
accurate to sub parts per million (ppm) levels.  The instruments
can often measure over a range of 0.1 ppm to 2000 ppm, with higher
ranges available upon request.  An ultra-stable, sealed ultraviolet
(UV) light source used as an ionization source, plus electronic
circuitry, provide instrument stability and repeatability.  Also
unusual is the mechanical simplicity of these photoionization
instruments (the meter movement and the sampling pump are the only
moving parts) which helps to ensure stability.  By employing the
photoionization detection principle, the Model 201 instruments
eliminate other problems common to older techniques.  There are no
optics, lenses, or mirrors involved, which eliminates periodic
alignment and coating.  There are no flames that can go out nor any
flow regulators  needed, since photoionization is independent of
flow, and there are no compressed gases required for operation.

Photoionization analyzers can be used to monitor a wide variety of
organic and some inorganic gases.  Aromatics, ketones, chlorinated
hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide, reduced sulfur compounds,
phosphine, ammonia, iodine, and hydrazine are among the gases which
can be measured.  The photoionization principle of operation
includes the absorption of UV light by a molecule which leads to
ionization via: R + hn  = R+ + e- where R+ is the ionized species
and hn represents a photon which has an energy greater than the
ionization potential of the species.  The sensor consists of a
sealed UV light source that emits photons which are energetic
enough to ionize many trace species (particularly organics) but do
not ionize the major components of air such as oxygen, nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water.  A chamber adjacent to
the UV source contains a pair of electrodes.  When a positive
potential is applied to one electrode, the created field drives any
ions formed by the absorption of UV light to the collector
electrode where the current (proportional to the concentration) is
measured.

Air Instruments & Measurements' Model 8000 Can Measure Up to 6
Gases in Real Time

Air Instruments & Measurements, Inc. (AIM, 13111 Brooks Dr. Suite
D, Baldwin Park, CA 91706-7901; Tel 818/813-1460 or 800/969-4AIM,
Fax 818/338-2585) has introduced its Model 8000 open-path analyzer
to measure up to 6 gases in real time across an extended (100 feet
or more) path length.  Raj Adani, National Sales Manager, told us
that the system is based on the company's double-pass optical
system which features automatic self-calibration with an internal
reference mirror and sealed gas cells and/or bandpass filters for
a known up-scale response.  The system is mounted in a sealed,
double-ended enclosure, and the sensor assembly includes a
thermostatted heater for weather protection.  Optional cooling is
also available.  The retroreflector end is passive, with no
electrical or moving parts, eliminating the need for thermal or
explosion protection.  AIM says the system is particularly well
suited for the detection of leaks and spills of hazardous, toxic,
corrosive, and/or condensable gases since it measures the sample in
place in the air with no sample contact.  Measurable gases include
HF, HCl, HCOH, benzene, toluene, vinyl chloride, CH4, NO, N2O, SO2,
CO, CO2, NH3, HCN, and water.

Legislated Acid Rain Requirements Will Reduce Fine  Particulate
Emissions

EPA, Congress and environmentalists will be pleasantly surprised to
learn that the scrubbers being installed to reduce acid rain will
also reduce fine particulate air pollution by 20,000 to 40,000 tons
per year.  These conclusions are contained in a new report issued
by the McIlvaine Company (Northbrook, IL) entitled  Heavy Metal
Removal from Coal-Fired Boilers .

There is renewed concern that fine particulate is the most serious
air pollution problem.  The utility industry is the largest
stationary source emitter.  The old coal-fired plants are not
regulated as to particulate emissions by any federal laws.  The new
SO2 reduction requirements for these plants allow either fuel
switching or scrubbers.  Scrubbers capture 80% of the fine
particulate (not captured by the precipitators) along with the SO2.
Most utilities are fuel switching in Phase 1, so this impressive
fine particulate reduction will be accomplished by only 15,000 MW
of scrubbers.

Scrubbers have the further benefit of removing air toxics.
Scrubbers would also remove 20,000 to 60,000 tons per year of
chlorine and 7000 to 8000 tons per year of fluorine.  The scrubbers
would also remove the toxic heavy metals which are measured in
pounds per year instead of tons per year.  The scrubbers would
remove 12,000 to 36,000 pounds/year of mercury and 13,000 to 42,000
pounds of chromium.  Even greater quantities of lead and manganese
would be captured.  Equal or smaller quantities of arsenic,
selenium, cadmium and other toxics would also be removed.

Liquid Fuels from Coal-Derived Synthesis Gas

Coal-derived syngas can be converted to methanol using liquid phase
methanol synthesis (LPMeOH) process.  Methanol can be further
converted to gasoline using the Mobil methanol-to-gasoline (MTG)
process.  The combination of syngas-to-methanol technology with the
MTG process thus provides a ready synthetic route for liquid
hydrocarbon fuels.  Sunggyu Lee and Conrad F. Kulik (Department of
Chemical Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, OH 44325)
have developed a process for one-step synthesis of dimethyl ether
(DME) from syngas.  This DME process improves the reactor
productivity and syngas conversion by as much as 100% over the
LPMeOH process.  One-step DME synthesis is thus an ideal front end
for further conversion to gasoline.  This substitution is justified
not only because DME yields an identical product distribution as
methanol, but DME is also a true intermediate in the MTG process.
The integration scheme has been termed the dimethyl  ether-to-
gasoline (DTG) process.  The advantages of the UA/EPRI process over
the conventional MTG process are in enhanced syngas conversion,
superior hydrocarbon yield and selectivity, and integrated energy
efficiency.  The researchers summarized their work in a paper
delivered at the 206th American Chemical Society (ACS) National
Meeting in Chicago, IL August 22-27, 1993.

Biodiesel Offers Environmental and Economic Advantages

Biodiesel fuel is produced by esterifying vegetable oils or animal
fats by reacting them with methanol in the presence of a catalyst
to produce methyl ester.  Its major attraction, besides its reduced
emissions characteristics, is its ease of use.  As opposed to
natural gas or electric power, biodiesel fuel can power existing
diesel engines with no modifications.  The Comprehensive National
Energy Policy Act of 1992 raised the expectations of the industry
since it redefined and broadened the term "alternative" fuel to
include any fuel "substantially not petroleum."

In May 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
provisionally approved petitions to register methyl soyate and
methyl tallowate as motor fuels and fuel additives permitting their
sale in that capacity.  Final approval depends upon research
demonstrating that methyl soyate and methyl tallowate are
"substantially similar" to diesel fuel.  While biodiesel fuel
reduces carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, and particulate emissions, it
is an oxygenated fuel and, accordingly, increases nitrous oxide
emissions.  Some industry sources expect EPA to consider each
emissions category separately instead of evaluating it for its
aggregate emissions reduction capability.  Such a decision could
jeopardize biodiesel's "substantially similar" designation.

The American Biofuels Association (ABA) expects mass transit to
provide most biodiesel activity over the next 5 or so years as EPA
urban fleet emissions requirements take effect in January 1995.
Since biodiesel is priced at $2.50-3.00/gallon, the ABA is pushing
for tax exemptions and credits at both the federal and state levels
to make the fuel competitive with conventional diesel fuel and
ethanol and bio-based methanol.  The ABA estimates that 3.4 billion
gallons of biodiesel could be produced annually in the U.S., which
would place land now idled by agricultural subsidies back into
production.  Excess soybean oil and yellow grease stocks would also
be utilized.

Waste Incineration Technology Produces Syngas

The Thermoselect waste incineration process gasifies unsorted
municipal solid waste (MSW) to produce syngas,  which is scrubbed
and fired in a conventional gas engine to generate electricity.
This results in significantly less waste gas emissions than in
traditional MSW incinerators, claims developer Thermoselect S.A.
(Locarno, Switzerland).  A demonstration plant at Verbania, Italy
has been operating at 100 metric tons/day of MSW and generating a
net positive balance of 300 kW.  Emissions per metric ton of waste
burned are lower than the proposed European Community (EC)
emissions standard, with actual emissions of 90 kg of hydrogen
chloride and 1 kg each of dust, hydrogen fluoride, mercury, and
cadmium.  The volume of unsorted waste is first reduced by a factor
of 10 in a conventional press.  The compressed waste is then fed
into a 600 C coking oven, where metals and inorganic substances
form a solid matrix with the charred organics.  Following a
residence time of 1-2 hours, the solid matrix is fed directly to a
gasifier at 2000 C to convert the organics to syngas and to liquefy
the inorganics and metals.  Each metric ton of MSW yields 30 kg of
recyclable metal, 250 kg of vitrified slag, and 600 kg of syngas.

Quantum Considers Increasing Methanol Production

Quantum Chemical Corp. (99 Park Ave., New York, NY 10016; Tel
212/949-5000) has taken its LaPorte, TX methanol plant off the
market.  The unit, which has a capacity of 200 million
gallons/year, is operating at only 100 million gallons/year due
mainly to a shortage of hydrogen feedstock.  The company says the
move is unrelated to its pending acquisition by Hanson PLC (1
Grosvenor Pl., London SW1X 7JH, England).  The company is studying
options to increase the output of the plant to respond to a
perceived increase in demand for methanol stemming from oxygenated
gasoline requirements.

Ceramic Engine Fueled by Methanol

A compact, low polluting ceramic engine which runs on methanol has
been designed by the Kanagawa Academy of Science and Technology
Foundation (3-2-1 Sakado, Takatsu-ku, Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Pref.
213, Japan; Tel +81 44 819 2043, Fax +81 44 819 2027).  It is
claimed to be about 30% more fuel efficient and to perform
similarly to a comparable diesel engine.  The prototype engine has
4 cylinders and a displacement of 2000 cc.  It occupies about 20%
less space than a diesel engine in the same class and weighs about
150 kg.  It is air cooled and can withstand temperature differences
of 800 C between the interior and exterior surfaces of the
cylinders.

Allied-Signal Increases the Production of CFC Alternatives

Allied-Signal (Box 2245, Morristown, NJ 07962; Tel 201/455-2000)
has completed a 6-month expansion program at its El Segundo, CA
facility as part of a $250 million investment in the development
and commercialization of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacements.
The company has doubled its annual capacity to 50 million pounds,
for hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-141b, which is used as a
replacement for CFC-11 as a blowing agent in insulating foams.
HCFC-141b is also used in new Allied-Signal specialty solvents.

The company expects to start full-scale commercial production of
Genetron AZ-50, a mixture of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-125 and (HFC)-
143a, at its Baton Rouge, LA facility in June 1994.  Allied-Signal
has also received Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approval of the
product, certifying it for use with UL-approved equipment.
Genetron AZ-50 is a replacement for the refrigerant R-502, a
mixture of CFC-115 and HCFC-22.

AT&T and Chrysler to Eliminate CFC Usage

Chrysler Corporation (12000 Chrysler Dr., Highland Park, MI 48288;
Tel 313/956-5741, Fax 313/956-1462) says that it will eliminate
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-12 refrigerant from air conditioning
systems in all Chrysler-built vehicles by January 1, 1994, two
years ahead of Federal mandates and faster than previously
announced.  "We've moved as aggressively as possible in removing R-
12 from our product line, and we believe our rapid deployment of
air conditioning systems using R-134a is in the best interests of
our customers and the environment," said Ronald R. Boltz,
Chrysler's Vice-President for Product Strategy and Regulatory
Affairs.  Chrysler reports that it is already using 134a on more
than 750,000 of its 1993 model year cars, the most of any automaker
selling vehicles in the U.S.  In addition to efforts on new cars,
Chrysler says that it is taking steps to help consumers with older
cars.  It is developing a CFC-free "drop-in" substitute with
Intermagnetics General Corporation (Box 566, Guilderland, NY 12084;
Tel 518/456-5456), which it says looks promising based on
preliminary data.

Separately, AT&T (550 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022; Tel
212/605-5500) says that it has ended the use of all Class 1 ozone-
depleting materials from its consumer and business manufacturing
operations.  In 1986 AT&T's manufacturing operations emitted 2.5
million pounds of CFC's.

Disagreement Surfaces over HCFC and Methyl Bromide Bans

European proposals for controlling ozone-depleting
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and methyl bromide have provoked
disagreement from several companies and countries.  The proposals,
which were finalized on June 9, 1993, are undergoing examination by
European experts.  These proposals stipulate the banning of HCFC's
by 2015 and a production and usage freeze on methyl bromide
starting January 1, 1996.  France, the only European Community (EC)
country where methyl bromide is produced, is anxious to protect its
industry and is unwilling to apply measures more stringent than
those of the Montreal Protocol.

The major corporate opposition in France stems from Elf Atochem
(Paris, France), Europe's only methyl bromide producer.  The
company is participating in a $400,000 program to develop
technology to prevent emissions of the gas, which is used primarily
as a soil fumigant.  Elf Atochem's 1990 methyl bromide production
was 5000 metric tons; European consumption of 14,000 metric tons
was met by imports from the U.S. and Israel.  Worldwide methyl
bromide production is about 65,000 metric tons per year.  The U.S.
plans to ban methyl bromide in 2000.  Accordingly, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is granting accelerated
reviews to methyl bromide alternatives.

Southern EC member countries Spain, Portugal, and Greece also
oppose the HCFC phaseout part of the plan.  Belgium, which has
minor reservations, supports the plan, along with Italy, the U.K.,
and Ireland.  Denmark, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Germany
want an even faster HCFC phaseout.

U.S. CFC Users Seek Exemptions

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has received about
20 requests from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) users seeking exemption
from the ban on the production of the ozone-depleting chemicals
which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 1996.  When they
voted in November 1992 to accelerate the phaseout of CFC's, the
parties to the Montreal Protocol On Substances That Deplete the
Ozone Layer included provisions for exemptions for essential uses.
Each country must formally nominate potential exempt uses to a
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) technical review
committee.  By its July 19, 1993 deadline, EPA had received 5
requests for exemptions for medical devices and 3 for refrigeration
or air conditioning uses, according to Nina Bonnelycke of EPA's
Substitutes Analysis and Review Branch.  Other exemption requests
were for the use of CFC's in analytical tests, as leak detectors
for nuclear submarines and power plants, in adhesives, in a wasp
killer, and in the manufacture of small caliber ammunition.  The
EPA will convene an interagency review group to decide which
applications warrant forwarding to UNEP.  In order to receive an
exemption, petitioners must demonstrate that the  use of CFC's is
critical to the functioning of society; that no alternatives are
technically, economically, or legally viable; and that no recycled
CFC's are available.

Ceramic-Based Catalysts Reduce NOx Emissions

Cormetech, Inc. (Treyburn Corporate Park, 5000 International Drive,
Durham, NC 27712; Tel 919/620-3000, Fax 919/620-3001) produces
ceramic-based extruded honeycomb catalysts for nitrogen oxide (NOx)
removal from coal-, oil-, or gas-fired stationary combustion
systems, such as utility and industrial boilers and gas turbines.
End users include electric utilities, petroleum refiners, and
chemical producers.  The homogeneous, titania-based, selective
catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts resist heat and chemical
attack.  In the SCR process, ammonia is injected into the flue gas,
where it reacts with NOx in the presence of the catalyst to form
nitrogen and water.  SCR systems have no moving parts and produce
no by-products.  When used in SCR systems at 400-1000 F, they can
remove more than 90% of NOx emissions.  The honeycomb structure of
Cormetech's high surface area titanium dioxide catalysts maximizes
catalytic activity while minimizing gas flow resistance.  Each
catalyst element is 150 mm square and can be provided in lengths up
to 1000 mm.  Variations in catalyst composition and cellular
structure are determined by the nature of each application,
especially the type of fuel being burned.  Catalysts are engineered
for each application to minimize erosion and exposure to plugging.

Gerhard F. Koenig, President and CEO, says that Cormetech can
simulate flue gas conditions, including space and linear velocity
relationships, at its in-house pilot testing facilities.  Bench-
scale "micro-test" reactors are part of the company's resources for
use in catalyst manufacturing process control or when limited
representative sampling is needed.  Flow modeling technology is
also available from Cormetech and permits gas flow simulation of
conditions encountered in the plant, including conditions in the
reactor itself.  Flow modeling options include cold flow techniques
as well as computer modeling.  The company can perform and
recommend system design modifications such as installation of
static mixers, vanes, and other devices to reduce gas flow
variations.  Reducing variations optimizes the efficiency of the
catalyst while preventing erosion and plugging, i.e., information
derived from the flow modeling permits "conditioning" of the flue
gas before it reaches the catalyst to optimize catalyst
performance.  The company delivered catalysts during the summer of
1993 for the U.S.'s first large utility retrofit using SCR
technology.  The project involved 2 power plants in southern
California.  Cormetech was formed in 1989 by Corning, Inc.
(Houghton  Park, Corning, NY 14831; Tel 607/974-9000) Mitsubishi

Air Products Unveils NOx and N2O Reduction Technologies

Research scientists at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (7201
Hamilton Boulevard, Allentown, PA 18195-1501; Tel 215/481-4911)
have discovered two catalytic technologies to reduce industrial
pollution.  One of the technologies reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx)
emissions from stationary and mobile sources, while the other
prevents nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from certain chemical
processes from entering the atmosphere.

The NOx technology employs metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts, along
with methane in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, to convert NOx to
nitrogen gas, carbon oxides, and water.  The company says that the
process offers an environmentally and potentially economically
attractive alternative to currently available NOx removal
technology that uses ammonia for reducing emissions from stationary
sources, such as industrial boilers or natural gas-fueled power
stations.  Methane used in the Air Products process is already
available at many facilities which emit NOx, and their NOx-
containing exhaust streams typically contain high levels of oxygen.
Air Products' John N. Armor said that the technology may also lead
to improved catalysts for removing NOx from mobile engine
emissions.

The company's technology for removing N2O emissions from off-gases
of certain chemical processes uses a different family of metal
loaded zeolite catalysts that decompose N2O into its benign
components, gaseous nitrogen and oxygen.  These catalysts are said
to be long-lived and stable over a broad (200-800 C) temperature
range.  In addition, some of the catalysts readily destroy N2O in
the presence of water vapor.  Air Products' Yuejin Li said that
these characteristics make the technology especially suitable for
the clean-up of off-gases from major sources of N2O emissions
formed during the manufacture of nitric acid and nylon-66.  Since
the "industrial revolution" began, the concentration of N2O in the
atmosphere has been steadily increasing about 0.2% per year.
Because the gas has an atmospheric lifetime of about 150 years, the
need exists to develop a commercially viable process for its
decomposition.

Technology Reviewed for Catalytic NOx Reduction

A large amount of equipment is in operation which uses ammonia in
V2O5-TiO2-W(Mo)O2 system (the selective catalytic reduction, or
SCR, method) to remove high temperature nitrogen oxides (NOx) from
generating sources, such as boilers and incinerators.  In these
systems, even when oxygen of high concentration is present, ammonia
reacts selectively with the nitrogen oxide (NO) and the reaction is
accelerated.  A conventional SCR process uses V2O5-TiO2 as the
catalyst.

Some European systems using zeolites are in operation, with about
50% applied on diesel engines.  This equipment is said to have
several advantages, including operation over a broad temperature
range (300-480 C), the ability to use either 25% ammonia solution
or pure ammonia gas as the reducing agent, the use of monolithic
ceramic catalysts containing no heavy metals, the absence of
sulfuric acid generation due to the low oxidizing capacity of SO2,
the storage capacity of NH3 and NOx is large enough to withstand
partial pressure fluctuations, and long catalyst life.

All SCR processes use ammonia to react with NO.  Problems of
untreated ammonia are being addressed by a research group at
Japan's Hokkaido University.  The group is evaluating a process
which uses hydrocarbons as reducing agents.  Their research is
fully described in the Japanese High Technology Monitor, Vol. 11,
No. 10.

Reduction Process

Goal Line Environmental Technologies (GLET, Box 58324, 2045 East
Vernon Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90058; Tel 213/233-2224, Fax
213/233-7428) has filed a patent application for its SCONOx
technology.  GLET President Robert Danziger told us that the SCONOx
process cost effectively reduces nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon
monoxide (CO) to below measurable levels at natural gas-fired power
plants.  The technology oxidizes nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), which is then absorbed and recycled into the power
plant's engine.  GLET is a co-venture of Sunlaw Energy Corporation
(Los Angeles, CA) and Advanced Catalyst Systems (Knoxville, TN).
Sunlaw, which operates two of the ten largest power plants in the
Los Angeles basin, plans to install a full-scale SCONOx system by
the end of 1993 and a second system in June 1994.

Catalyst-Coated Panels Can Reduce NOx Levels

High-rise buildings and sound barriers lining highways may act as
scavengers of 20% of such "greenhouse" gases as nitrogen oxides
(NOx) if the walls and sidings are coated with a mixture of
titanium oxide, activated carbon, and a  small amount of iron (III)
oxide.  In laboratory-scale tests at Japan's National Institute for
Resources and Environment (NIRE, Tsukuba, Ibaraki Pref., Japan),
panels coated with such catalysts have removed more than 90% of NOx
from a 0.05 parts per million (ppm) stream under irradiation,
equivalent to conditions on a cloudy day, by near-ultraviolet
light.  Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are oxidized
by TiO2 to NO2 and NO3-, respectively.  The activated carbon
component serves to fix the NO-derived NO2 so that it can be
further oxidized to NO3-.  In practice, rain water will wash the
NO3- off the panels.  In a country with Japan's level of rainfall
(1.5 m annually), only a slight decrease in the pH of any runoff,
equivalent to about 10 ppm, is expected, according to NIRE.  A 5-
year project to develop a viable technology began in April 1993.

Alumina Catalyst Aids Low Temperature NOx Reduction

Cosmo Oil Co. Ltd. (1-1 Shibaura 1-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105,
Japan; Tel 03-798-3211) has succeeded in keeping nitrogen oxides
(NOx) particles from diesel engine exhaust to less than 100 parts
per million (ppm) for more than 2000 hours by utilizing a honeycomb
alumina catalyst and alcohol as the reducing agent.  The company
considers this an important first step in the practical use of the
technology for the difficult job of controlling NOx emissions in
the presence of high-concentrations of oxygen.  Cosmo plans to
continue the research and testing in an effort to raise the under
100 ppm time interval from 2000 to 4000 hours.  The company also
has targeted the 200kW diesel engine of a cogeneration system for
demonstration testing.  The technology features low temperature
(300-400 C) NOx removal to minimize the deterioration of the
catalyst due to steam.  Sakai Chemical Industry Co. (Ebisujima-cho
5-chome, Sakai City, Osaka Pref. 590, Japan; Tel 0722-23-4111) and
several diesel engine manufacturers are also participating in the
test work.  The technology was first developed by Japan's National
Institute of Materials and Chemical Research and its Petroleum
Energy Center.

Pulp and Paper Process Reduces Sulfur and Chlorine Emissions

Formic acid and hydrogen peroxide replace sulfur- and chlorine-
based compounds in the cooking and bleaching steps of a pulp and
paper process under development by Kemira Oy (Helsinki, Finland).
The driving forces behind the Milox technology have been
legislative mandates in Europe and the U.S. to reduce chlorine
emissions from wastewater and to remove sulfur compounds from waste
gases.  The Milox process is in operation in a 150 kg/h pilot plant
and, says the company, could be in operation in a 5000-10,000
metric tons/year demonstration plant by 1995.  Lignin, the gum that
binds the cellulose fibers in wood, is removed by reaction with
hydroxonium ions (H3O+) in 3 stages.  The first and last stages are
carried out at 80 C in a solution of 80 wt % peroxyacetic acid,
formed by the reaction of H2O2 and HCOOH, while the second stage is
an 80 wt % solution of HCOOH at 100 C.  Milox pulp produces paper
of similar quality and brightness to chlorine-bleached kraft pulp,
says Kemira.

German Process Cuts SO2 and HCl Emissions

Caldyn Apparatebau GmbH (Ettlingen, Germany) has devised a process
for cutting sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen chloride emissions to
20 parts per million (ppm), well below the 100 ppm German limit.
The company claims that the process consumes only 33-50% of the
lime required by competitive processes.  Flue gas enters a dryer at
250-1000 C where it is sprayed with 50 mm diameter lime particles.
In this step, the lime is completely consumed, reducing SO2
concentration by 70%.  Following de-dusting, the gases are washed
in a second scrubber that combines an additional nozzle-sprayed
lime slurry with a water aerosol.  At this step, the lime
concentration, 70%, is 7 times higher than in competitive
processes, reducing the scrubber size by 50%.  Following a final
de-dusting step, the gases are released.  In addition to the
company's 500 m3/h mobile pilot plant, Caldyn has installed a 3200
m3/h system on a chemical waste incinerator in Bonn, Germany, which
started in June 1993.  Negotiations are in progress for a 44,000
m3/h unit for an incinerator at an animal feed plant in eastern
Germany.

Natural Gas Technology Cuts NOx Emissions

Institute of Gas Technology (IGT, 3424 South State Street, Chicago,
IL 60616; Tel 312/949-3650, Fax 312/949-3700) in tests at the
Anchor Glass plant in Huntington Park, CA  confirmed that an
advanced glass melting technology is effective in reducing nitrogen
oxides (NOx) emissions.  Hamid A. Abbasi, IGT's Assistant Director
- Applied Combustion Research, told us that the technology uses
staged natural gas combustion with oxygen enrichment to lower NOx
levels below 3 pounds of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) per ton of glass
produced.  A consortium of gas utilities led by Southern California
Gas Company and the Gas Research Institute is supporting the
development of this technology.  The process does not increase
natural gas consumption, and oxygen requirements are low (less than
5% of stoichiometric) for operating conditions that reduce NOx
remissions below the Southern California regulation of 4 pounds of
NO2 per ton of glass produced.  To demonstrate the stating concept,
IGT and its commercial partners, Combustion Tec, Inc. (Box 607693,
Orlando, FL 32860; Tel 407/299-7317) and Air Products and Chemicals
(7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA  18195; Tel 215/481-4911), made
only minor modifications to a 165 ton/day glass melter.  Glenn C.
Neff, President - Combustion Tec, said that the changes are
transparent to furnace operators, and no adverse effects on the
quality of container glass have been observed.  According to Buddy
Eleazer, Air Products' Technology Manager - Glass Applications,
three months of additional testing are now under way to acquire
design data for the commercial introduction of the technology.

Ammonia Injection Lowers Engine NOx Emissions

James W. Davis (277 Kavenish Dr., Rancho Mirage, CA 92270) has been
assigned a patent for a method of reducing engine pollutants,
particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The process described in US
Patent 5,224,346, issued to Lester P. Berriman, John M. Zabsky,
James W. Davis, and William M. Hylton on July 6, 1993, involves the
injection of ammonia into a conduit between the cylinder exhaust
valves and the catalytic converter.  Ammonia injection occurs far
enough downstream of the exhaust valves to avoid burning of the
ammonia and at a location where the exhaust gases are at a
temperature of at least 1200 F.  The ammonia reacts with the NOx in
the exhaust gases prior to the gases reaching the catalytic
converter, which eases the load on the catalyst.  To minimize
ammonia use, it is injected only one minute or so after cold engine
startup when the catalyst is too cold to be effective and during
operation of the engine at high power levels, when the greatest
amounts of NOx are produced.

phase shifting of both the intake and exhaust valve timing events.
Also, reed valves restrict the backflow of exhaust gases into the
intake ports.  The phase shifting and use of intake reed valves
optimize the intake and exhaust event timing at the four major
engine operating conditions: idle, part load, wide open throttle
low speed, and high speed.

characteristics.  The gas burner described in US Patent 5,224,855,
issued to Hajime Toyonaga, Toshio Nishida, Yasuo Takeishi, and
Masao Shiomi on July 6, 1993, uses two sets of flame openings.  The
first set discharges stable, self-combustible, high-concentration
gas; and the second set of flame openings discharges unstable, non-
self-combustible, low-concentration gas.  The two sets of flame
openings are arranged in an alternate pattern.  The stable flame
formations at the first set of flame openings assists stabilization
of flame formations at the second set of flame openings.
Consequently, the gas burner may have a high air excess ratio to
reduce its NOx generation and to prevent incomplete combustion.

EPA Delay in Implementing Air Permit Rule Causes States to Miss
Program Submission Deadline

Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) charged the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with issuing a permit
rule that would identify minimum elements of state permit programs
and govern the implementation of state efforts.  Disagreement among
EPA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Council on
Competitiveness delayed the rule's issuance for 8 months.  This has
hindered implementation of the Title V permit program since some
states have waited for the final rule to be issued before
developing their own programs.  Similarly, certain state
legislatures waited for the final rule before enacting legislation
authorizing agencies to fully implement programs and assess fees to
cover their costs.  Because the final rule was issued after many
state legislatures adjourned in 1992, many state agencies had to
wait until 1993 to obtain legislative authority.  As a result, some
states doubt that they will be able to submit their program plans
to EPA by the November 1993 deadline.

Cost estimates by some states indicate that they will face problems
in funding their permit programs.  Although many state agencies
have adopted the $25 per ton of emissions presumptive fee set by
Congress in Title V because of political and economic pressure to
keep fees low, many state officials do not consider this fee
adequate to fund their programs.  For example, Texas' permit
program costs are expected to increase by nearly 300% when Title V
is fully implemented, from the current level of about $15 million
to about $42 million, or $30 to $35 per ton of emissions.  North
Carolina's Clean Air Act Advisory Council has determined that the
state's cost of meeting Title V will be $12 million, or $36 per ton
of emissions.  Wisconsin has estimated that Title V will increase
its needs from $9 million to $18 million.  Wisconsin officials
believe that the state's permit fees should be set between $35 and
$40 per ton to generate the necessary revenue.

Center for Resource Economics (CRE) Report Criticizes EPA

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is failing to carry
out its mission because of gross under-funding and skewed
priorities, according to a study by the Center for Resource
Economics (CRE), a Washington, DC-based nonprofit environmental
research organization.  EPA needs a budget increase of at least 13%
"to provide even minimally adequate environmental protection," the
report says, but instead is facing an 8% cut in its 1994 budget.
The CRE report found that EPA has a 22% budget shortfall in its
core operating programs and, as a result, is unable to fully
enforce a single environmental protection statute.  EPA spends 80%
of its funds on pollutants ranked as relatively low risks by the
agency, with 20% going to high risk pollutants, charged CRE.
Inactive toxic waste sites and point source discharges to surface
water, two of the low risk categories, receive 54% of EPA
resources, while high risk air pollutants receive only 6%.  Worker
exposure to chemicals, radon, wetlands destruction, and global
climate change - all high risk areas - receive less than 1% each of
EPA's resources.  "More than 2 decades after its creation, EPA
cannot guarantee the safety of pesticides and other toxic
substances widely used in the U.S.," CRE said.  EPA officials say
that their priorities are largely determined by laws passed by
Congress and that the agency's budget is constrained by the federal
budget deficit.

Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Allowances Auction Canceled

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) canceled its scheduled June 1993
auction of sulfur dioxide emissions allowances because the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not implemented a
computer-based allowance tracking system.  CBT successfully ran
EPA's March 1993 auction.  EPA says that the tracking system is
unnecessary for companies to trade the allowances privately.

U.S. Leads in Pollution Control Equipment Exports

The U.S. was the world's leading exporter of pollution control
equipment in 1991 with a trade surplus of $1.1 billion according to
a report released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA).  Germany led in 1990, but U.S. companies took the lead in
1991 with $188 million more in exports than Germany.  U.S.
environmental exports increased 70% from 1989 to 1991, while
imports increased 45%.

Inst. of Clean Air Companies says Smog Control Costs Exaggerated

The Institute of Clean Air Companies, Inc. (ICAC, 1707 L Street NW
Suite 750, Washington, DC 20036-4201; Tel 202/457-0911, Fax
202/331-1388), the national association of air pollution control
suppliers, has released cost figures for high efficiency control of
nitrogen oxides (NOx) that are only 20-50% of the costs assumed by
state regulators in determining reasonably available control
technology.  ICAC released the figures in comments on a report,
Evaluation and Costing of NOx Controls for Existing Utility Boilers
in the NESCAUM Region, (Evaluation Report) prepared by Acurex
Environmental Corporation for the Northeast States for Coordinated
Air Use Management (NESCAUM) and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA).  ICAC's cost figures show that much more NOx can be
removed for a given level of investment than air quality regulators
have assumed.  For example, the Evaluation Report pegs capital
costs for retrofitting hot-side selective catalytic reduction (SCR)
technology on a 200 MW pulverized coal boiler at about $150/kW.
ICAC says that current market transactions show that this cost is
$30-70/kW, depending on the difficulty of retrofit.  Costs for oil-
and gas-fired retrofits, as well as for new installations, are even
lower.

States are revising their Clean Air Act implementation plans to
further cut NOx emissions, which contribute significantly to urban
smog and acid rain.  "Clean air policy depends on assumptions about
the cost of air pollution controls.  In the case of NOx, reliance
on inflated cost estimates is leading decision makers to establish
unnecessarily loose standards based on controls that can remove no
more than half of a boiler's NOx emissions, when SCR technology is
available to achieve 80-90% emission removal," stated Jeffrey C.
Smith, ICAC's Executive Director.  "The market  history of SCR
technology exemplifies the path of most air pollution controls
commercialized in the U.S. over the past 30 years.  Competition
pushes costs significantly lower and raises performance and
reliability dramatically," Smith added.  A copy of ICAC's written
comments is available from the organization, which has prepared
comments highlighting what it claims are inaccuracies in the
treatment of selective non-catalytic (SNCR) reduction of NOx in the
Evaluation Report.

Cost Effectiveness of Eliminating CO Vehicle Emissions Studied

The cost effectiveness of identification and repair of vehicles
with excessive carbon monoxide emissions was investigated over the
1991-1992 winter period in Provo, UT.  This pilot program used on-
road remote sensing at two locations to identify repeat gross
polluting vehicles.  The owners of gross polluters observed at one
of the locations were solicited for a free repair program carried
out under the direction of the Utah Valley Community College, Auto-
Diesel Division.  The same two locations were revisited after the
repair program had terminated and the vehicle emissions were
remeasured.  Gary A. Bishop, Donald H. Stedman, James E. Peterson,
Theresa J. Hosick, and Paul L. Guenther (Chemistry Department,
University of Denver, University Park, CO 80208-0179) obtained more
than 17,000 measurements on over 10,000 individual vehicles.  As
observed elsewhere, half of the total carbon monoxide was emitted
by only about 10% of the vehicles.  Solicitation letters were sent
to 114 owners, and 47 vehicles were recruited and repairs
attempted.  Of the 47 vehicles, 28 were remeasured when the site
was revisited at the end of the program.  They had improved their
on-road emissions by more than 50%.  The vehicles which were
identified as gross polluters at the second location, but not
notified of their status, were used as the control group.  Their
emissions were also reduced, but only by 14%.  This pilot program
demonstrated carbon monoxide emissions reduction at a cost
effectiveness of $200 per ton, not including the cost benefits of
gas mileage improvement.  $200 per ton is lower than many current
or proposed mandatory programs.  The owner's repair cost would more
than pay for itself in terms of improved fuel economy.  The program
would also generate the on-road fleet emissions data necessary to
evaluate its effectiveness.  Without such data, a program is forced
to rely on computer modeling with its known limitations.  The
researchers published the results of their work in Air & Waste,
Vol. 43, July 1993, 978-988.

Multi-Layer Coating Reduces VOC's

Du Pont (Wilmington, DE 19898; Tel 302/774-1000) has been assigned
a patent for a low volatile organic compound (VOC) multi-layer
clear coating.  The process described in US Patent 5,227,201,
issued to Lee R. Harper on July 13, 1993, forms multiple coats of
finishes on a substrate by first applying a color basecoat layer of
pigment-containing acrylic polymer latex.  Before the basecoat is
cured, a clear coat acrylic polymer having crosslinkable groups and
a crosslinking agent in a volatile organic solvent is applied.  The
layers are cured simultaneously.

VOC's Thermally Stripped from Soil

Richard and Junior L. Crosby (7819-105 Calibre Crossing, Charlotte,
NC 28227) has  a patent for a process which thermally strips
volatile organic compounds (VOC's) from soil using a recirculating
combustible gas.  The transportable system described in US Patent
5,228,803 was issued on July 20, 1993 and includes a vessel in
which contaminated soil is placed in contact with a hot gas.  The
gas is discharged from the vessel, and ambient air is introduced
into the gas to ensure that it remains combustible.  A blower
circulates the gas to a cyclone separator, where fine soil
particles and ash are removed.  The VOC's in the gas are removed by
combustion in a burner fired with a supplemental fuel.  A portion
of the combusted gas is exhausted to the atmosphere, and the
remainder is recirculated to the vessel where the process is
repeated.

a low volatile organic compound (VOC) cleaner.  The composition
described in US Patent 5,230,821 was issued to John C. Larson and
Gary L. Horton on July 27, 1993.  It includes an aqueous emulsion
of a non-aromatic organic phase stabilized with a blend of

VOC Emissions from Glycol Dehydrators Reduced

The Gas Research Institute (Chicago, IL) has been assigned a patent
for a system to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
from glycol dehydrators.  The system described in US Patent
5,209,762, issued to Philip S. Lowell on May 11, 1993, places a
glycol in contact with a natural gas stream to extract water from
the gas.  The glycol is regenerated by heating it to vaporize the
absorbed water.   The vented steam VOC contaminants flow from the
glycol regenerator to the bottom of a steam stripper column.  The
vapors from the top of the steam stripper column are condensed to
produce a water stream with a relatively high concentration of
VOC's.  The water stream is passed to the top of the steam stripper
and then through the stripper counter-currently to the vented gases
and steam.  The condenser water stream is thereby stripped of most
of its organics content and emerges from the bottom of the stripper
column.

RESOLV  Vapor Recovery Systems Capture VOC's

New chemical vapor recovery systems developed by Air Products and
Chemicals, Inc. (7201 Hamilton Boulevard, Allentown, PA 18195-1501;
215/481-8451, Fax 215/481-5431) are helping the chemical process
industries (CPI) meet volatile organic compound (VOC) emission
regulations mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments (Air Toxics
emissions) while reducing costs through the recovery of valuable
chemicals.  RESOLV  chemical vapor recovery systems can remove 95-
99% of the VOC's by using liquid nitrogen to cool process vent
streams to targeted temperatures, condensing, and capturing the
VOC's in liquid form.  The VOC's are captured before they are mixed
and diluted by other waste streams, thereby significantly reducing
disposal costs.  The recovered chemicals can then be sold or
recycled in the manufacturer's operation.  Additionally, further
cost savings can be achieved, since the required quantity of
nitrogen to operate a RESOLV system is often already available on-
site.

In a typical RESOLV installation, liquid nitrogen and VOC emission
streams pass through an indirect condenser.  In the condenser, the
cold liquid nitrogen condenses the VOC's and captures them in
liquid form, while the liquid nitrogen simultaneously converts to
gaseous nitrogen.  The clean, VOC-free vent stream exits the
recovery system, and the clean, gaseous nitrogen is then used
elsewhere in the chemical manufacturing process such as in inerting
processing or storage vessels.  The purity of the nitrogen remains
intact, since it does not come into direct contact with the VOC's.
As a result, Air Products' RESOLV systems permit chemical
manufacturers to realize both the cryogenic and inerting benefits
of their nitrogen supply without the cost and performance
disadvantages associated with freeze-thaw systems.

Air Products says that RESOLV systems offer several advantages over
alternative technologies for meeting VOC regulations.  Air
Products' systems are flexible and can accommodate changes in VOC
regulations without re-engineering the system.  The amount of VOC's
recovered with a RESOLV system can be adjusted simply by reducing
the  temperature of the indirect condenser.  In addition, capital
costs are less; permitting of flares, incinerators, or catalytic
combustion equipment is avoided; and there are no environmental
problems associated with nitrogen oxide and small amounts of non-
combusted VOC's.  RESOLV systems also eliminate the disposal
problems created by adsorption technology or scrubbers.

Air Products' Dr. Bud Dalton, Commercial Development Manager for
the technology, stressed that "RESOLV systems are more than end-of-
pipe solutions; they can be integrated upstream into manufacturing
processes to achieve additional savings."  Air Products customizes
these systems to cost effectively address each customer's VOC
stream composition and recovery/compliance targets.  In some
instances, the CPI customer may only require supplemental cooling
to meet current emission standards.

RE-THERM VF Units Treat VOC's

Research-Cottrell Reeco, Inc. (Box 1500, Somerville, NJ 08876; Tel
908/685-4000, Fax 908/685-4181) is marketing its RE-THERM VF system
to oxidize volatile organic compounds (VOC's) and other airborne
pollutants.  Nicholas Coppola, Senior Vice President - Sales, told
us that the technology offers destruction efficiencies of 96-99%.
During operation of the RE-THERM VF system, contaminated process
air enters the unit through an inlet manifold.  Flow control valves
direct the exhaust into those regenerative chambers that have just
switched to the "inlet" mode.  These chambers contain hot ceramic
stoneware that has absorbed most of the heat energy from a previous
batch of exiting cleaned air.  When the incoming, contaminated
exhaust is drawn through the hot stoneware bed, its temperature
increases.  This causes many pollutants and odor-causing compounds
to auto-ignite even before they reach the main purification
chamber.  Gas or oil burners in the main chamber maintain the
required purification temperature.  If the incoming gas stream
contains enough VOC's, the unit can self-sustain, keeping fuel
costs very low.  The purified air is channeled out through a
stoneware bed that has switched to the "outlet" mode.  There, it
deposits most of its heat energy which is transferred to yet
another batch of incoming, contaminated process exhaust.  In most
applications, warm, clean air is then vented to the atmosphere.
Another option is the return of the warm exhaust to the plant to
heat dryers, ovens, or other equipment.  In some units, waste
solvent can be used as auxiliary fuel, further reducing operating
costs and alleviating the plant's solvent disposal problem.  Single
units with a horizontal flow design can treat up to 500,000
ft3/minute.

Fate of VOC's in Municipal Activated Sludge Plants  Investigated

The fate of volatile organic compounds (VOC's) in municipal
activated sludge plants has been investigated at pilot and full
scale.  Wayne J. Parker, Doug J. Thompson, John P. Bell, and Henryk
Melcer found that more than 80% of the mass flow of non-chlorinated
compounds was biodegraded while less than 20% was removed by
stripping.  Conversely, 46% of the mass flow of chlorinated
compounds was biodegraded and 47% was removed by stripping.
Adsorption of VOC's onto waste sludge was not a significant removal
mechanism.  The pilot plant used effectively emulated the liquid-
gas phase partitioning and overall compound removals of a full-
scale plant.  There was little difference in liquid-gas phase
partitioning for coarse and fine pore diffusers in spite of
differing mass transfer characteristics as demonstrated by oxygen-
transfer measurements.  This implies that equilibrium between the
liquid- and gas-phase concentrations was achieved with both
diffuser types.  Stripping of VOC's increased with air flow, but
the extent of stripping increased at a declining rate.  The
researchers summarized their work in a paper published in Water
Environment Research Vol. 65, No. 1.

ICI Paints Reduces VOC's with Water-Based Formulations

In an effort to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
from paint solvents, ICI Paints (Slough, UK) has developed what its
says is the first water-based metallic paint for automotive
refinishing.  About 15% of the 800 million liters/year of paint
sold by ICI goes to the auto refinishing market.  The product is
scheduled for introduction in both Europe and the U.S. later in
1993.  The company estimates that European auto repairs account for
about 117,000 metric tons/year of VOC emissions.  ICI has been
active in the Canadian auto refinishing market for many years and
entered the U.S. arena in September 1992 with its existing organic
solvent-based product line.  The new water-based product, which
adapts a microgel latex paint system used in car manufacturing
since the early 1980's, contains only about 15% organic solvents
instead of the 85% or so contained in conventional metallic paints.
ICI hopes to reduce the organic solvent content below 10% by 1994.
The price of the new paint will be 5-30% higher than the existing
product line, but ICI points out that users will be able to avoid
the installation of VOC emissions control equipment.  The company
is manufacturing the new paint at Stowmarket, UK and is undecided
about U.S. manufacturing plans.

Influence of Landscape Variability on Atmospheric  Dispersion

Using idealized distributions of surface moisture, Roger A. Pielke
and Marek Uliasz (Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State
University, Fort Collins, CO) have shown that with a significant
synoptic prevailing flow over regions of surface variability,
dispersion is generally enhanced over heterogeneous surfaces as
compared to horizontally homogeneous conditions.  The importance of
heterogeneity becomes less as the large-scale wind speed increases
and/or the spatial scale of the heterogeneities become less.  The
work demonstrates that the use of Gaussian regulatory models in
areas of landscape variability is inappropriate.  The researchers
published the results of their work in Air & Waste, Vol. 43, July
1993,989-994.

Atmospheric Sulfur Oxidation Influence by Droplet Size in Clouds
and Fog

Cloud and fog have traditionally been assumed to be composed of a
chemically homogeneous population of droplets.  Model predictions
and experimental investigations by Xin Rao, Aaron Bator, and Jeff
Collett, Jr. (Institute for Environmental Studies, University of
Illinois, 1101 West Peabody Drive, Urbana, IL 61801) indicate that
this assumption may not be correct.  Variations in chemical drop
sizes across the drop size spectrum have been predicted and
observed in a number of environments.  The researchers examined the
influence of such variations on aqueous phase oxidation of S(IV) in
the atmosphere.  Measurements of the composition of various drop
size fractions in clouds and fog often reveal differences in pH.
Measurements of S(IV) and H2O2 concentrations in radiation fogs in
California's central valley revealed a dependence on drop size as
well.  Simultaneous variations of pH, S(IV), and H2O2
concentrations across the drop size spectrum complicate predictions
of net rates of sulfur oxidation.  The researchers believe that it
is unlikely that the average rate of sulfur oxidation across the
drop spectrum will be equal to the rate predicted based on average
cloud or fog drop compositions.  They summarized their work in a
paper, Chemical Variations Across the Cloud Drop Size Spectrum and
Their Influence on Sulfur (IV) Oxidation in the Atmosphere,
delivered at the 206th American Chemical Society (ACS) National
Meeting in Chicago, IL August 22-27, 1993.

Software Models Processes and Tracks Chemical Usage

ModelVision Software, Inc. (13186 Trail Hollow, Houston, TX 77079;
Tel 713/461-0043) has commercialized a process modeling and toxic
chemical tracking system.  The software, Visual Chem Track ,
provides both integrated process simulation and lifetime tracking
for more than 1100  chemicals.  "PC-based simulation and accounting
within individual processes and facility-wide meets the critical
needs of managers," said John Shaffer, ModelVision President, who
added, "Federal, state, regional, and local environmental, health,
and safety regulations mandate precise documentation and reporting.
At the same time, good management practice calls for constant
analysis and revision, both of individual operations and entire
processes.  Since businesses must keep accurate information for
compliance, our software builds on that base by means of a dynamic
model."

Shaffer said that the software is user-friendly and that the on-
line "help" feature allows users to master the software at their
own learning pace.  Each engineer or process manager describes in
detail the facility, production unit, and component operations
including the names and quantities of chemicals involved.  Once the
model is built, the system provides continuous, accurate tracking
of all chemicals, showing where efficiencies can be obtained in
both chemical use and by-product generation.  Using Visual Chem
Track, engineers and process managers describe facility and
individual production units in visual, process flow diagrams; enter
chemical substances involved in each step of facility operation;
track chemical consumption, processing, and by-product generation
at both the production unit and total facility levels; fine tune
operations using a mass balance transfer function to automatically
tabulate and balance chemical inputs and outputs; track more than
1100 compounds by CAS number, usage, or generation threshold,
regulation, and/or type of operation; provide a basis for comparing
operations with plans, assuring that both the total facility and
individual production units and sub-units operate optimally.
Visual Chem Track prepares federal and state environmental forms,
and produces reports tailored to management's specifications to
analyze trends and aid decision making.  The software requires
Microsoft Windows 3.1, an 80386 or higher microprocessor, and at
least 2 megabytes of RAM.  Visual Chem Track is priced at $2000.

German Technology Cuts Toxic Incinerator Residue

GSB mbH (Munich, Germany), a waste disposal company, has pilot
tested a process to cut the amount of toxic residue from 4500
metric tons/year to 3900 metric tons/year at a 70,000 metric
tons/year incinerator in Ebenhausen, Germany.  In the process,
fluegas from the incinerator first passes through an electrostatic
precipitator (ESP) to remove the dust.  Sulfur dioxide is then
removed from the fluegas in a 2-step washing process.  By
dissolving the dust from the ESP in the acidic wash water from the
first step of the fluegas cleaning process, GSB can transfer up to
80% of the dust  collected by the ESP to the wastewater stream,
which is then neutralized with calcium hydroxide or calcium
carbonate.  The undissolved material, including the metal
hydroxides, is filtered and vitrified in 2 stages at 500 C and
1000 C, respectively.  The dissolved salts, mainly calcium
chloride, go to a wastewater treatment plant.

Vitropore Ceramic Candles Clean Hot Flue Gas

Pall Corporation (2200 Northern Boulevard, East Hills, NY 11548;
Tel 516/484-5400 or 800/645-6532, Fax 516/621-3976) Vitropore
ceramic filter candles are intended for hot gas solid separation
processes.  Hot combustion gas is too corrosive and contaminated to
be filtered by any media other than ceramics.  If not adequately
filtered, solid particles and acid gases will cause erosion and
fouling of energy recovery system components.  Vitropore ceramic
candles combine high burst strength and thermal shock resistance
with high permeability, high filtration efficiency, and corrosion
resistance in a rigid silicon carbide medium.  They can remove
and/or recycle catalysts from any catalytic reaction.

The candles are made of finely-ground silicon carbide grains.
During manufacturing, grain size is carefully controlled to achieve
an even pore size distribution throughout the candle's length.
After blending the grains, the candles are isostatically pressed
and machined to specific dimensions.  Porosity and permeability are
uniform throughout the entire length of the candle, which provides
consistent filter performance during blowback operations.  Pall
claims that its Vitropore candles collect more than 99.9% of
influent solids on the surface of the filter medium.  The company
says that this high removal efficiency is due to the candle's top
surface layer which is a thin, du rable, fine-pore membrane
composed of one or more layers of bonded ceramic material.  This
surface membrane is supported by a thicker, coarser substrate which
enables the candles to function as barrier filters.  They are
especially suited to pulse cleaning or blowback operations, since
particle penetration of the filter body is minimized.  The result
is quantitative solids separation, free of migration or unloading
of particulate matter and consistently good effluent quality.  Pore
says that a major advantage of Vitropore candles is their ability
to withstand heat up to 1000 C due to a proprietary binding
material highly tolerant of thermal shock.

Vitropore candles remove contaminants and/or recover product in
halogenated hydrocarbon, petrochemical, catalyst activator, fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC), hazardous materials incineration, and
fluid bed coal gasifier applications.

The Changing Climate of Collaboration

     One dividend of our exploration of space has been that
series of photographs of earthrise over the moon -- of our
blue-green planet, fragile and entire in space.  As part of its
copyrighted series of op-ed ad pieces in the New York Times and
Wall Street Journal, Mobil Corporation (MOB-NYSE) last month
invoked the earthrise image to call for a new era of
collaboration between the camps of business and environmentalism.
Mobil says business "gets the picture."  That we are indeed all
in it together on spaceship earth and that changing times have
brought business to an understanding of environmental
responsiveness and activism.
     Mobil isn't alone.  A rising tide of collaborative studies,
initiatives, and projects large and small indicate a trend away
from confrontation and toward cooperation.
     Jim Middaugh, spokesman for the US Environmental Defense
Fund (EDF), told BATE "After twenty years of litigating, we're
finding that the carrot of improved profits is as compelling as
the stick of legal action."  And, true to that promise, EDF is
working with McDonald's Corp. (MCD-NYSE) in a major study to find
ways to reduce, reuse, recycle, and compost the solid waste from
the 11,000 McDonald's around the world.
     The EDF-McDonald's joint task force, a first between a major
environmental group and leading fast food retailer, will spend
six months looking at every step in McDonald's business.  The
joint announcement lists redesign and reduction in use of
packaging and shipping materials, increased use of materials with
less environmental impact, increased recycling and use of
recyclable packaging, composting of organic wastes, increased use
of reuseables shipping containers and foodware, and increased use
of recycled materials as possible areas of examination.
     The consultancy is distinctive because of the potential
leverage from its findings and the nature of the relationship.
In addition to the 11,000 McDonald's stores, there are another
130,000 fast food outlets and 330,000 restaurants in total in the
U.S. that stand to gain  from what is learned.  And every day,
McDonald's serves 22 million customers.   That's 22 million
chances every day to implant an environmental responsibility
message in the public mind.
     The agreement is carefully structured.  The study will be
made public and the feasibility of the recommendations assessed.
McDonald's says that, where feasible, they will implement the
recommendations.  If EDF and the hamburger maker disagree
materially, each has the right to issue a dissenting or separate
opinion.  Either party can end the project if no agreement looks
possible, and each is paying its own share to ensure
independence.
     So . . . within a week of one another, we have US$50 billion
Mobil saying "We don't see two camps.  Energies that ought to be
joined in collaborative efforts are far less productively
employed when slinging gibes or lawsuits.  When we work in tandem
-- or at least pull in the same direction -- a lot gets done."
And we have Fred Krupp, executive director of EDF, saying his
organization is "hopeful that this process (with McDonald's) will
illustrate ways in which business and environmental groups that
have significantly different perspectives can nevertheless work
together to achieve environmental improvements that are in the
public interest."
     Mobil's public call for conciliation and the EDF-McDonald's
venture are both discrete news events and points in a growing
trend.

Changing the Minds of Utility Regulators

     Other examples of corporation-environmental organization
collaboration are beginning to produce measurable results.  In
the summer of 1988, the US Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) and
New England Electric (NES-NYSE) agreed to work cooperatively on
conservation and load management programs and the attendant
regulatory and rate adjustments in the face of reduced sales.
     The transition from an adversarial to a cooperative
relationship has had an appreciable impact.  Armond Cohen, a
senior attorney on the CLF staff told BATE that in 1990, "New
England Electric will spend US$56 million on conservation,
exclusive of load management.  Over the life of that investment,
the NES outlay will yield savings to customers of $154 million in
current dollars."  Cohen reports that of the net $98 million pool
of savings, $80 million will be returned to the ratepayers, $10
million will cover costs, and $8 million will be returned to the
shareholders -- a .5% addition to the stockholders' return on
equity.  Cohen calls that an "attractive incentive to encourage
continued investment in conservation.  And," the Boston lawyer
continues, "those numbers don't reflect the reduced societal
costs of fewer dirty windows, less air pollution, fewer
respiratory problems."
     In 1991, says Cohen, the utility's conservation investment
will jump to $80 million, with $180 million in resulting savings
over the life of the investment.  The success of the CLF-NES
collaboration, particularly with state regulatory commissions,
has now been extended to 12 retail electric companies in New
England and New York and the development of a national
electricity conservation program for Jamaica.  $40 million was
invested across New England in conservation in 1987.  That figure
jumps to $200 million for this year, in part the result of the
initiative between New England Electric and CLF.  And the
investment will rise to $250 million in 1991.  The result?  In
what Cohen calls a conservative estimate, one third of otherwise
needed power plants in the region out to the year 2010 won't have
to be built, freeing that capital for other uses.
     At the National Audubon Society, Senior Scientist Jan Beyea
reminds that the Coalition of Northeast Governors (CONEG) has
brought together representatives of environmental organizations,
the various states' agencies and most importantly, 12 corporate
members in an extended collaborative effort to hammer out
standards and definitions of environmental terms -- leading to an
environmental seal for consumers.  In addition to his CONEG
participation, Beyea says he is often consulted informally by
corporations seeking Audubon's advice or opinion on new packaging
or product introductions.

European, Pacific Examples Surfacing

     While BATE's sources in Europe and Australasia all concede
that they are not aware of collaborative examples as remarkable
as the lion and lamb union of McDonald's and EDF, new initiatives
are surfacing.  In the United Kingdom, 30 non-government
environmental organizations have formed a coalition to foster
co-operation and environmental advocacy.  The Environment Council
calls its Business and Environment Programme "a major element" of
its work.  Steve Robinson, Chief Executive of the Environment
Council, numbers more than 300 corporations on the program's
membership rolls.  In an interview, Robinson told BATE the aim of
the Business and Environment Programme is "to promote the concept
that environmental sense is commercial sense."
     Robinson cites a recent exercise with 3M U.K. PLC during
which "50 environmental practitioners from our member
organizations sat down with 3M to talk about the benefits of a
complete corporate environmental policy -- how to prepare,
formulate, and most important, implement a company-wide
environmental policy.  As a result," said Robinson, "3M has just
adopted and made public a comprehensive environmental policy."
     On the Pacific Rim, Phil Noyce of Australia's Commission for
the Future (and soon to head Greenhouse Action Australia) advises
that his agency has been advising the international accounting
and management firm of Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu on a potential
expansion from financial to environmental auditing.
     David Stephenson, an environmental strategist and senior
counsel at the Boston marketing communications firm of Agnew,
Carter, McCarthy, sees more strategic collaborative alliances
ahead.  "There are probably thousands of saplings out there this
summer dying from neglect.  They were planted by companies who
wanted or needed an Earth Day press release, and then forgotten."
McCarthy thinks one-shot environmental gestures are fading.  As
senior managers incorporate environmental considerations into
every step of planning, budgeting, producing, and selling, the
expertise and experience of environmental groups will offer an
attractive opportunity for synergy.  Measurable new profits and
immeasurable public benefits can result.

European Environmental Venture Fund Reaches First Round Funding
Goal; Will Make Commitments By Year's End

     A European venture capital fund based in the United Kingdom
has exceeded its first round funding goal and is already in due
diligence on a variety of startups aimed at solving European
environmental problems.  The fund, the first of its kind in
Europe, is called the TR ECOTEC Environmental Fund.  The venture
fund is a limited partnership combining the skills of Touche,
Remnant & Co. in London and ECOTEC Investment Service Limited of
Birmingham.  ECOTEC is an independent corporate strategy,
economics, and marketing group specializing in the environmental
protection and waste management industry.  Touche, Remnant's
specialist technology investment team is seven years old and has
some 190 million pounds under management.
     The fund's objective is to secure high total returns through
capital growth, by investment in emerging companies engaged in
the environmental protection and waste management industry in all
of Europe.
     Richard Haines, Director of ECOTEC, told BATE the fund has
16 million pounds in hand, 1 million pounds more than their
interim goal.  "Within two years, we seek to have raised 30
million pounds," said Haines.  The fund is an unrecognized
collective investment scheme under the UK's Financial Services
Act.  Which means investment by private individuals is
prohibited.  Haines says "pension funds and blue chip
corporations predominate among the subscribing institutional
investors."
     Asked to characterize the proposals the fund has gotten so
far, Haines called them "all over the lot as to technology,
strategy, and polish -- as you might expect.  The greatest number
are water and waste water treatment schemes, tertiary processes
in membranes and other advanced filtration processes where the
technology is just emerging.  Next in quantity," Haines
continued, "are the land remediation companies.  And we're seeing
a lot of joint ventures between Northern European and US
companies on the one hand and Southern European companies on the
other.  An example is proposal by a Danish air pollution
management company and a Spanish engineering firm for a joint
venture in Spain."
     No investments have yet been made, but, says Haines, "We're
down to a dozen or so in due diligence and we expect to make two
commitments by the end of the year."

Internal, External Forces Affect Earnings at Big Waste
Collectors

     The New York-based Value Line investment service ranks the
US environmental companies first among 97 sectors for relative
share price performance over the next 12 months.  In an era of
rising environmental awareness and expectation, these growing
companies can count on continued public and private scrutiny --
on operations and on stock performance.
     Houston-based Browning Ferris Inc. (BFI-NYSE) posted third
quarter sales of US$767.562 million and operating income of
$82.378 million, up 18.5% and 8.8% respectively over the similar
period last year.  Analysts said BFI had reduced the out-of state
waste it accepted at its big Ohio landfill to appease regulators.
Diminished volume there and eroding margins as competition
heightens abroad accounted for results below expectation.
     For Waste Management Inc. (WMX-NYSE), it wasn't the second
quarter results -- earnings up 26%, to $178.872 million -- but
rather how an article in Barron's looked at Waste Management's
accounting that created ripples.  An article by Abraham Briloff
cites the booking of a non-taxable gain of $70.8 million
resulting from the unrealized appreciation of shares of its
Chemical Waste Management after Chemical's initial public
offering as an example of "liberal accounting."
     Rollins Environmental Services (REN-NYSE) saw quarterly net
go from red to black ink as the Wilmington, Delaware company saw
big new incinerators begin to operate at close to capacity.
Rollins netted $7,224,000 on $52,486,000 for the quarter ended 30
June.  That compares to a loss of $33.5 million on sales of $39.
6 million for the comparable quarter in 1989.  Rollins is on
target for a $200 million year with earnings of $19.179 million
on sales of $146.492 million for the first three quarters of its
fiscal year.
     The addition of used oil recycling and waste fluid recovery
to Safety-Kleen's (SK-NYSE) core business of automotive and
industrial parts and tool cleaning is producing steady gains.
From Elgin, Illinois, Safety-Kleen reports second quarter
earnings of $11,995 million -- 15% better than the same period
last year.  Sales were $132.885 million for the quarter and
$258.488 for the first six months of 1990.  Net earnings rose
from 31 cents to 35 cents per share quarter to quarter over '89.
     Chemical Waste Management (CHW-NYSE), 78% of which is still
held by Waste Management, added four cents to its per-share
earnings for its second quarter.  The largest of the US hazardous
waste handlers booked earnings of $43.081 million on revenues of
$270.446 million for the period ended 30 June, lifting earnings
from 17 cents to 21 cents per share over 1989.

Regulatory Uncertainty Whipsaws a New Public Company

     Even after the worldwide dip in equity markets brought on by
the Iraqi crisis, U.S. shares of pure environmental companies are
performing better than other sectors.  Of five environmental
companies that have gone public this year, four are trading above
their IPO prices.  The shares of Mid-American Waste Systems Inc.
(MAWS-OTC), Environmental Elements Corp. (NLCO-OTC), Sanifill
Inc. (FIL-AMEX), and Tetra Technologies (TTRA-OTC) are all
showing gains.  Sanifill, which closed at US$25 as we went to
press, was offered in April at $9.50, up over 150%.
     The laggard is Horsehead Resource Development Company
(HHRD-OTC) whose experience underscores the changing, expanding
regulatory climate facing environmental remediation companies and
the need for investors and businesses to be both nimble and
diligent.  Horsehead, offered at $14.50 a share in July, rose to
$22, but closed as we went to press at $13.75.  The company
recovers zinc in steel mills in western Pennsylvania that recover
steel from scrap metal.  Horsehead resells the zinc and also
recovers lead and cadmium from the steelmaking dust and sells
that to other processors.  The recycling produces a slag and the
slag is the problem.  The US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) doesn't regulate the slag, and indeed the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation is a Horsehead client and uses the
slag on icy roads.  Because the process isn't regulated, the
costs are low compared to regulated landfills and other waste
treatment and recovery operators.
     The trace lead, cadmium, and chromium in the slag has
produced an unusual alliance.  Environmental groups and the
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, the waste treatment operators,
have joined to challenge the EPA to regulate the slag.  A federal
district appeals court in Washington, D.C. said last month that
the EPA does indeed have the power to regulate the slag and asked
that it begin to do so.
     Only in its final offering document did Horsehead mention
the federal court case, saying even then that the ruling was
immaterial.  Horsehead contends that its recovery technology is
the industry standard and that the EPA accepted that notion.
     The company is at work on a process to use the slag to
reclaim more heavy metals from waste water, but the regulatory
pressure is there.  Reports on all these developments by Debra
Coy, an analyst for County NatWest subsidiary Washington Analysis
Corp. and the volatile price of zinc have combined with market
volatility to move Horsehead's shares lower.

Taxes on Carbon Proposed on Two Continents

     Businesses operating in the European Community may soon be
subject to a carbon tax.  The notion is part of a position paper
on potential economic and fiscal instruments of EC environmental
policy.  Action may come as soon as next month.  The paper calls
greenhouse gases "one of the most pressing problems of the energy
sector."  The carbon tax would be based on the amount of carbon
dioxide produced by each kind of fuel.  And presumably would
reduce greenhouse emissions by increasing efficiency and spurring
conservation and non-carbon based alternative energy research.
Depending on the array of conservation measures and energy
performance standards for buildings and appliances, a carbon tax
could increase fossil fuel prices by 20-30%
     The ideas raised in the EC paper will be on the agenda of an
informal meeting of EC environmental ministers in Rome next month
and may be acted on in formal session in October.
     The carbon tax idea is surfacing on the other side of the
Atlantic as well.  In an op-ed piece in the New York Times on
August 6, David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council
and Alan Miller of the University of Maryland's Center for Global
Change, the authors urge President Bush to adopt a carbon tax,
saying the measure "would yield billions while sharply reducing
greenhouse emissions."

EPA Announces Stringent Sulfur Reduction Rule for Diesel Fuel

     In 1988 US petroleum refiners and diesel engine
manufacturers prepared a joint proposal to the EPA for on-highway
diesel fuel modification.  That landmark collaboration is the
basis for an EPA measure to reduce sulfur by 80% in diesel fuel.
Earlier rules resulting from the industry initiative limit heavy
duty particulates.  This new standard, to be met by 1 October
1993, reduces sulfur content of diesel fuel from 0.25 percent to
0.05 percent by weight.
     The rule will add as much as 2.3 cents per gallon to diesel
prices.  The EPA estimates annual costs to refiners between
US$380 and $910 million in 1995, and as much as $1.3 billion by
2010.  The measure will reduce the cost of emissions control
devices, saving buyers $60 to $325 per vehicle.  Fuel savings
from the newer more efficient catalytic technology will amount to
$200 million in 1995 and $465 million in 2010.  The measure may
cut engine wear, bringing the direct economic benefit above the
increased cost per gallon.  Nevertheless, expect the fuel
increases to be passed on by transit authorities and every
shipper using diesel trucks to virtually all of the nation's
commuters and consumers.
     The US measure is projected to reduce sulfate particulates
by 196,000 tons by 1995 and reduce sulfur dioxide levels by
580,000 tons annually.  Sulfur dioxide further oxidizes in the
atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfates,
components of acid rain.
     European pressure to match the US standards has prompted a
cost study by CONCAWE , a consortium of 36 petroleum companies
controlling 90% of Western European refining capacity.  CONCAWE
finds, depending on diesel demand and the availability of low
sulfur crude, that to produce 0.05% sulfur content diesel fuel,
the 12 EC countries could expect to make an additional capital
expenditure of between US$3 billion and $4.3 billion; that the
cost per ton of sulfur removed would range between $6,000 and
$9,000; and that the total manufacturing costs would reach to
between $12 and $18 per ton of diesel fuel.  (These are metric
tons, which equal 1.102 US tons.)
     For more information on the EPA rulemaking, the contact is
Martha Casey at +1 202 382 4378.  Information on the CONCAWE
study can be gotten from Denis Lyons, CONCAWE, Madauplein 1,

Superfund Changes Put EPA (and Taxpayers) Between Banks and
Environmental Groups

     The US Superfund is a two-pronged federal tool to clean up
toxic sites.  The law sets a standard of liability for those who
pollute that is strict, joint, and federal.  That means a person
or corporation can be liable regardless of fault, and that the
government can go after cleanup costs from any one defendant.
The other prong is the pool of money, Superfund itself.  Those
dollars can be used to clean orphan sites where those
responsible cannot or will not pay.
     Although Superfund can cast a wide net, lenders have
typically been protected from the law's reach.  Merely holding
collateral or other security interest, typically a mortgage, in a
contaminated property will not set off Superfund liability.
     In return for this protection, banks and savings and loan
institutions are obliged to exercise due diligence in evaluating
environmental risks as part of their lending.  That has soured
some deals, but more importantly produced heightened awareness
and environmental protection, possibly staving off some future
Superfund sites.  In the Senate, S.2827 exempts lenders "from any
law imposing strict liability for the release . . . of hazardous
substances from property (1) acquired through foreclosure; held
in fiduciary capacity; or (3) held, controlled, or managed
pursuant to the terms of an extension of credit."
     That, says William J. Rogers of the Environmental Defense
Fund, guts Superfund's powers and preempts state laws.  Lenders,
the environmental groups testify, will look the other way,
avoiding the diligence current law mandates.  A similar bill,
with 273 co-sponsors, awaits the House Transportation and
Hazardous Waste subcommittee when Congress returns.
     Bankers, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), and the
Resolution Trust Corp. (RTC) all say they need the safe haven of
the new law's protection.  FDIC chairman William Seidman told the
Senate panel pollution liability is a major impediment to
government sale of properties acquired in the S&L bailout, with
the delay raising costs to taxpayers.   The EPA has recently said
that the banks and federal agencies have legitimate concerns.
And taxpayers, in framing advocacy, must decide whether they wish
to pay higher taxes for more Superfund relief or higher taxes for
increased costs in the S&L bailout.  The economics will be
thrashed out in September when the Congress reconvenes.

California Firm Ready for Expanded Pollution Rights Sales, But
Some Companies Won't Sell

     On the list of market-based incentives against acid rain,
one of the wildest is pollution rights.  The US EPA has
established a practice of creating and granting rights to pollute
the air.  Robert Beck of the Edison Electric Institute in
Washington, DC told BATE power plants are assigned a fixed number
of allowances.  "Allowance" in this case means a ton of sulfur
dioxide that the plant is allowed to emit annually.  "They're
assets," says Beck.  "Companies can lease them, trade them, buy
and sell them.  They can only be used forward in time and they're
recognized on a calendar year."
     Markets crave efficiency; pollution rights are no different.
Enter AER*X,  a pollution rights brokerage firm in Los Angeles,
the brain child of John Palmisano, who started the system while
he worked for the EPA.
     AER*X has just been sold by WPL Holdings to NaTec Resources
(NATC-OTC), which in turn is 44.8% held by CRSS Inc. (CRX-NYSE).
The $1.4 million company may benefit from expanded pollution
rights in the clean air bill that will move out of conference
when the US Congress returns in the fall.
     But there are uncertainties.  Tom Zosel, manager of
pollution prevention at Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing
(MMM-NYSE), cautions that "the EPA is tightening its market
mechanisms in non-attainment areas.  Companies that use the
credits are essentially going forward and modifying as they go.
For a time, the EPA was making policy in response to specific
instances, so the initiators were ahead of the curve . . . but
everyone learned to live with a high degree of ambiguity."
     Zosel reports that 3M is no longer selling emission credits,
but is buying.  "3M has spent $160 million to implement
substantial emissions reductions.  If we turn around and sell the
rights to what we've gained, we've done nothing for the
environment.  We're keeping the rights for future growth or to
return to state and local agencies as improvement in air
quality."

Regional Center Will Build Foundations for Environmental Action
in Central and Eastern Europe

     That the governments of Eastern Europe did not provide clean
air and clean water contributed in part to their overthrow.  Now,
as these new governments move away from command economies, they
are inundated by sellers of environmental remedies.  Because the
problems are so large, so are the opportunities to profit.
     One international initiative on the environment that stands
to rationalize the process is the Regional Environmental Center
for Central and Eastern Europe in Budapest.  The center's charter
was signed earlier this summer by the US, The Netherlands,
Hungary, and the European Community.  Other nations in the region
are expected to sign on.
     The Center will operate as an independent, not-for-profit
non-governmental organization under a 15-member international
board.  BATE asked Helen Petrauskas, vice president for
Environment and Safety Engineering at Ford Motor Company and one
of three US board members, where the board will begin.
     "We're starting from scratch," said the Ford executive,
"defining the kinds of institutions and the level of democratic
participation.  You must remember those nations must draft whole
new sets of environmental laws and create and staff environmental
ministries."
     "I hope we can create a credible neutral meeting place for
government, industry, and the environmental NGOs to come
together," Ms. Petrauskas continued.
     The Center's charter calls for work in four areas:
collection and dissemination of data; development of
institutions; education; and matching available resources with
regional needs -- a clearing house.  Asked whether this function
could be viewed as a trade mission, Ms. Petrauskas said, "There's
no doubt we're in the role of exporting economic expertise,
getting help on what's worth buying.  Poland, for instance is
besieged by environmental vendors and is trying to sort out the
claims.  But we have to be careful not to assume our way is the
best way."  Asked what she meant, Ms. Petrauskas said that a
regional model similar to the European community might offer the
best solutions.
     Philip Warburg, director of the Central and East European
Environmental Program for the Environmental Law Institute in
Washington, DC, echoed Ms. Petrauskas's observations. "First,
credible environmental protection regimes must be put in place,
and that raises issues of appropriate public involvement, the
public right of access to information, citizen suits, and the
role of the judiciary."
     Warburg cautioned environmental businesses that would go to
the region to be aware of "considerable differences in
receptivity in different countries.  Where the Hungarians are
entrepreneurial, Czechoslovakia, for instance, is emanating a
certain ambivalence to industrial perspectives.  In their vision,
they don't feel the need for a carbon copy of western values.
But," continues Warburg, "that skepticism shouldn't be penalized,
but understood."

European Automakers Lead in Recycling

     For decades, rebuilt parts were an example of Yankee
ingenuity -- the reuse of durable, well-designed parts.  But U.S.
OEMs are struggling to catch their competition, particularly in
Europe, where a longer look at the lifecycle of all the materials
in cars is yielding interesting innovations.  Cars are being
designed to be reused and recycled, from bumper to bumper.  In
the face of stiffened recycling rules pending for EC members, the
German automakers are especially active.  BMW is building a
recycling plant in Wackersdorf.  Volkswagen is recycling
thermoset plastic sheet molding from its front ends on Golf
models and using it on engine shields in the same car.  The
thermoset technology is particularly interesting because the
thermosets, unlike the easily meltable thermoplastics, are
created from strong interlocking compounds, and therefore resist
easy handling.  Grinding and pyrolysis -- high heat (760 degrees
C) and no oxygen -- are beginning to produce results.  Mercedes
Benz has built a demonstration car with all its recyclable
components in green.  Mercedes is recycling excess plastics from
trunk floor production, reprocessing thermoplastic and
polyurethane panels to fabricate cable wrappings and wheel wells,
extracting and reusing the "noble" metals -- platinum, rhodium,
palladium, and cerium -- from catalytic converters.
     VDA, the German automobile manufacturing association, has
developed a labeling program for automotive plastics.  The plan
is designed to ease sorting and recycling.  Volvo, perhaps the
most environmentally proactive car maker, has joined the Germans
in adopting the VDA standards.

Du Pont Paired with Industry Council to Reduce Delaware Waste

     In another public-private partnership, Du Pont (DD-NYSE) and
the Council for Solid Waste Solutions are each giving the state
of Delaware grants of US$20,000 to fund a computer software
system for the statewide reduction of solid waste.  The software,
called WastePlan, was designed by Tellus Institute, a public
interest consulting firm.  The system is in place as a statewide
planning tool in Michigan and New York and as a municipal
planning tool in Boston.  The system helps state and local
planners assess the economic and environmental impacts of
collection and disposal systems.
     Du Pont's share will pay for the software license.  The
council's half will go for training and continuing technical
support.  Du Pont's Paul Wyche put the Delaware initiative in
context, telling BATE "Du Pont has pilot solid waste projects in
Florida, Tennessee, Texas, and Illinois.  In Illinois, we're
working with the state department of transportation to make
highway safety barriers from high density polyethylene.  That
project is up and running."
     Asked whether the money for the Delaware and other solid
waste initiatives came from a corporate giving budget or a line
budget, Wyche said the grants came from operating funds, and that
the set-asides for such projects were growing as Du Pont's and
the communities' awareness grew.

Trans-National Corporate Progress Against Ozone Depletion

     Company by company, CFCs and other ozone-depleting compounds
are being eliminated around the world.  Some recent developments:
     Intel Corp. (INTC-OTC), the Santa Clara, California
semiconductor maker, has plants in Ireland, Israel, Singapore,
Penang, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and the USA.  Intel says it
will eliminate chloroflourocarbons (CFCs) from its worldwide
manufacturing processes by 1992.  The company began tracking CFC
use in 1987.  Using conservation and alternate technologies,
Intel has reduced its CFC usage some 30% to date.  Intel has
substituted an aqueous-based cleaner for CFC-113 on its circuit
boards and targets not only CFC-113, but also CFC-11, 12, 114,
115, TCA, and carbon tetrachloride for elimination by the target
date.  The company announcement calls the program "one of the
most aggressive in the industry."
     The Big Three Japanese carmakers are making inroads on
CFC-12, the automotive air conditioning refrigerant.  Honda has
begun a worldwide program to get cfc recycling units in the hands
of its authorized dealers.  The units capture CFC-12 from the car
systems for purification and reuse.  Each unit will cost 260,000
yen or some US$1,700.  In Japan, Honda says 2,000 of its 2,600
dealers will have the units by this fall.
     Toyota set up its CFC Action Committee in April 1989.
Toyota says it will have CFC recovery and recycling units in its
service shops worldwide by next summer.  Toyota targets the
elimination of CFC-based foaming agents in its upholstery by the
end of 1991, and like every car manufacturer, is testing
substitute refrigerants and reconfigured A/C systems using HCFC
and other more ozone-benign compounds.
     Nissan says its CFC recycling hardware will be in place at
all its dealerships and service centers worldwide by March of
1992.  And Nissan will phase out CFCs in its autotomotive air
conditioners by the end of 1995.
     Lockheed, (LK-NYSE), the aeronautics and space manufacturer,
was stung in June by a Greenpeace allegation that the company was
a "laggard, failing to halt its use of ozone-destroying
chemicals."
     Lockheed's internal timetable calls for elimination of
ozone-depleters by the year 2000, a policy it points out is
consistent with Montreal Protocol targets.  In the last two
years, Lockheed has reduced its CFC-113 emissions 39% and TCA
(1,1,1 trichloroethane) emissions by 43%.
     Lockheed's government relations manager, Katherine Strehl,
pleads that the company's requirements "are often more stringent
technically and operationally . . . because ours frequently
involve spacecraft that must function for years without repair or
replacement of parts."
     In Toronto, Northern Telecom (NT-NYSE) says it has reduced
CFC use by half in the last 18 months.  The communications giant
has saved US$1.5 million in CFC-113 reduction and another $1
million in US CFC consumption taxes avoided.  The company has
joined with the US EPA to publish a manual on CFC management
practices for small and mid-sized CFC-113 users.

Flakt Will Retrofit Taiwanese Power Plant for $115 Million

     The ABB Environmental Systems Division of Flakt, Inc., a US
subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri, will design, engineer, and build
a wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system for Taiwan Power
Company's Lin Kou station near Taipei.
     Robert A. Agonis, vice president -- FGD systems for the
ABB/Flakt unit, is the project manager and just back from Taipei.
Agonis told BATE that a rising tide of democracy after the
lifting of martial law in Taiwan has produced a vocal, involved
populace with environmental concerns a high priority.  "With air
pollution going wild in Taipei," said Agonis, "the prime minister
is under considerable political pressure to make a success of
this plant."  Agonis's division won the job in competitive
bidding with contractors from Japan and West Germany.  Flakt Inc.
is the world leader in installed capacity for FGD systems.  The
US division accounts for US$500 million of the Stockholm-based
company's $2.8 billion in sales.  And Flakt's volume in turn is
part of ABB's $20.56 billion in global sales.
     The Taiwanese contract calls for the retrofit of two 350 mw
generating units -- the delivery of a turnkey FGD system.  The
technology will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 90% in a
process that combines limestone and a water spray with the flue
gas from the coal-fired plant.  As a by-product, the system
produces a commercial grade of gypsum for use in construction,
road building and concrete manufacture.
     The contact comes as the Republic of China's Economics
Ministry is launching a nation-wide energy conservation campaign.
Add the Republic of China to the list of countries, many of them
in Eastern Europe, where environmental technology vendors can
find new markets.

CALIFORNIA PLANNING DEVELOPMENT REPORT via NewsNet
JANUARY 1996

RESEARCHERS CALL FOR CEQA REFORM

  The California Environmental Quality Act should permit wide-
ranging discussion of environmental issues at the planning
stage but provide tightly focused analysis at the project level,
according to a new report from a team of researchers at the
University of California, Berkeley.
  "Fixing CEQA," a report published by the California Policy
Seminar, is the latest in a long series of documents suggesting
how CEQA might be reformed. It comes on the heels of a recent
policy report by the Little Hoover Commission, which also
proposed some changes to CEQA. But the Berkeley report also
contains a great deal of data on how CEQA is used by planning
practitioners in California.
  Underlying both reports is the ongoing question of what the
relationship should be between CEQA and the planning process.
Comparing CEQA to the National Environmental Policy Act and
17 other "mini-NEPAs" around the country, the research team
concluded that CEQA is much more widely used at the project
level than its counterparts P a fact that often makes it the
"driver" on many planning issues. Only the mini-NEPAs in
Washington and New York are used in so wide a range of
situations, but development activity in those states is a fraction
of what it is in California.
  Like the Little Hoover Commission report, the Berkeley team
recommends greater involvement of state and regional
agencies in the CEQA process and incentives to provide greater
certainty all along the line. "The fundamental problem with
CEQA," the researchers report, "is that it fails to encourage
fairness and consistency in the review process or in the
required impact mitigations." This problem is reflected in what
Berkeley planning professor John Landis, the lead researcher,
calls "the 90%/10% problem." "For 90% of the projects which
are not controversial, CEQA works fine," he said. "For the other
10%, it falls apart."
  Unlike the Little Hoover Commission report, however, the
Berkeley report does not recommend that CEQA be used as the
primary tool for environmental decision-making on a regional
and state basis. (For more information on the Little Hoover
Commission report, see CP&DR, December 1995.) "They want to
regionalize CEQA," Landis said. "I'm not sure that's the right
thing to do." Landis acknowledges that four regional issues
continually pop up in CEQA analyses: air quality, water, wildlife
habitat, and traffic. Instead of using CEQA as a regional tool to
solve these problems at the project level, the Berkeley team
recommends using CEQA in a different way at the plan level
and the project level. The Berkeley researchers also
recommended a series of improvements to cumulative impact
monitoring to handle regional issues.
  "At the planning stage," concluded the research team, "CEQA
should encourage a broad and open-ended discussion of
alternatives and environmental impacts. This discussion should
be integrated with ongoing local, regional, and state planning
processes. Environmental review of specific projects, by
contrast, should focus on the impacts of that project in relation
to all underlying adopted plans, still attempting to establish
feasible mitigation measures for all significant adverse
impacts."
  The Berkeley team's five specific recommendations are:
  1. Improving the involvement of state and regional agencies
in the CEQA process. This is similar to the Little Hoover
Commission's recommendations and it draws from the research
team's observation that state and regional agencies are
unpredictable players in the CEQA process.
  2. Increasing the certainty and consistency of local CEQA
review. Like the Little Hoover Commission, the Berkeley
researchers noted that a lack of consistent thresholds and other
standards makes it difficult for applicants to know how the
process is going to move forward. Among other things, the
Berkeley researchers propose that localities be forced to adopt
standardized thresholds and standardized mitigation measures
to be used in mitigated negative declarations.
  3. Improving mitigation and monitoring of cumulative
impacts. To overcome CEQA's chronic project-oriented
approach, the research team recommended such steps as an
expanded use of tiered environmental impact reports,
standardized mitigation measures to deal with regional
cumulative impacts, and greater use of pro-active regional
planning and conservation efforts.
  4. Making alternatives analysis better or else eliminating it.
The researchers characterized current alternatives analysis as
little more than a "scaling exercise" that shows how
environmental impacts can be reduced if the scale of the
project is reduced. The researchers proposed expanded
alternatives analysis at the plan level and a more fine-grained
alternatives analysis at the project level. But if these cannot be
achieved, the researchers concluded, the alternatives analysis
is not worth keeping.
  5. Creating more consistency and predictability in CEQA
litigation. The research team concluded that CEQA currently
contains few incentives to mediate disputes and/or avoid
litigation. The team recommended that the Governor's Office of
Planning and Research create a series of guidebooks to
establish "best CEQA practices" in areas where judicial direction
has not been clear or consistent.
  "Fixing CEQA" is available by contacting the California Policy
Seminar at (510) 642-5514.

  What distinguishes the Berkeley study from previous CEQA
analyses is the huge amount of data collected by the
researchers. Among other things, the researchers surveyed
local governments in California and quantified their use of
CEQA; did an in-depth comparison between CEQA and the other
"mini-NEPAs" around the country; and a case study analysis of
CEQA use in 14 local jurisdictions ranging from Calaveras
County to Rancho Cucamonga. (Some of the survey data,
analyzed by University of Illinois planning professor Robert
Olshansky, was discussed in the October 1994 issue of CP&DR.)
  Here are some of the research team's most interesting
findings:

  CEQA Is More Widely Used Than Comparable Laws Elsewhere.
  The researchers compared the use of CEQA in California to the
so-called "Mini-NEPAs" in other states. Mini-NEPAs exist in 15
other states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Yet
CEQA is more widely used in California than in any other state P
and, in fact, it's more widely used than NEPA, the National
Environmental Policy Act.
  Whereas California undertook some 1,300 environmental
impact reports in 1990, the equivalent figure (in 1992) was
only 364 in New York, 126 in Washington, and 69 in
Massachusetts. Connecticut undertook no environmental impact
reports/statements in 1992. Even the federal government,
operating under NEPA, initiated only 456 EIS's in 1992.
Similarly, while California processed more than 25,000
negative declarations in 1990, the equivalent figure (for 1992)
was 1,800 in New York, 7,500 in Washington, and only 12 in
Connecticut.
  Part of the reason for the difference is that the breadth of
CEQA's application is greater. But part of it is simply that
California's construction activity is so much greater than any
other state. When adjusted for the amount of construction
activity, the researchers found that only Washington and New
York have approximately the same amount of CEQA-type
activity. Hawaii and Minnesota lag far behind, while all other
states are barely even on the radar screen.

  EIRs and EIR Litigation Is Rare In Statistical Terms
  The researchers found that, statewide, well over 90% of all
CEQA actions result in negative declarations. Only about 6% of
CEQA cactions lead to EIRs in cities and 3.5% in counties. And
only one in every 354 CEQA reviews (less than 1/3 of 1%)
results in a lawsuit. But because CEQA is so widely applied, the
raw numbers are high even though the percentages are low.
The Berkeley numbers indicate that somewhere around 1,300
EIRs were being undertaken in 1990, while more than 400
CEQA lawsuits were filed in the five-year period between 1986
and 1990.
  The case studies revealed large variations in these numbers,
however. In Santa Barbara County, for example, 21% of all
CEQA reviews led to an EIR P a figure almost three times higher
than any other case study jurisdiction.
  The researchers also discovered that EIRs are far more
commonly used on residential projects than on commercial or
industrial projects. On a per-capita basis, more than twice as
many EIRs are initiated for residential as opposed to
commercial projects, and this finding holds true for both cities
and counties.

  Thresholds Are More Common for Counties Than Cities.
  The Berkeley researchers found that 80% of counties used
standardized thresholds in CEQA review compared to only 12%
of cities.

  Mitigated Negative Declarations Are Commonly Used
  The researchers found that mitigated negative declarations
are used more than half the time in CEQA reviews, though they
noted this includes a wide variety of different situations. This
figure was considerably higher for counties (66%) than for
cities (48%). More than 70% of all jurisdictions reported that
they have a mitigation monitoring program in place.

ADELANTO PAYS PRICE FOR BASE, WATER FIGHTS

By Morris Newman
   The City of Adelanto in San Bernardino County finds itself
isolated and on the brink of municipal bankruptcy, partly as a
result of longstanding fights with its Victor Valley neighbors
over control of a closed military base and the regional water
supply.
  The city is running a $4 million deficit and, until recently,
appeared in danger of defaulting on its bond payments.
Adelanto is also facing a $5 million settlement on a lawsuit
with San Bernardino County, and must borrow money from the
county to make its debt payments on redevelopment bonds.
The financial problems have also forced Adelanto to abide by a
regionwide water allocation that the city initially resisted.
  The story of this High Desert city is a worst-case example of
what happens when one city decides to resist regional
cooperation. It is also an extreme example of the trend in
California for jurisdictions to conduct business with each other
through the courts, and the consequences of doing so. While
most of the blame seems to lie squarely with the city's elected
leadership, recent news reports suggest that San Bernardino
County, the City of Victorville, and the Mojave Water District
each played a role in chastening the maverick city.
   Currently, Adelanto is desperately trying to avoid defaulting
on its bonds. In October, the city's bond underwriter, Tony
Wetherbee, disclosed at a council hearing that the city was
running a $4 million deficit after having spent more than $9
million in lawsuits against
neighboring jurisdictions. As of December, the redevelopment
agency was $760,000 short of a $2.4 million payment on a
bond issue of $46 million.
  Wetherbee is refinancing the redevelopment agency's bonds
by structuring a new issue of $55 million that would allow the
city to make its bond payments while allowing enough extra to
pay off the hefty settlement to San Bernardino County.
  Adelanto's path to near-ruin began in 1989, when the federal
Base Realignment and Closure Commission listed George Air
Force Base on its closure list. Adelanto, which borders the base,
wanted to annex the entire base and rejected the option of
joining the local reuse authority, the Victor Valley Economic
Development Authority (VVEDA), which includes San
Bernardino County and the neighboring cities of Victorville,
Hesperia, and Apple Valley.
  At one point, Adelanto offered the Air Force $25 million to
buy the base outright. The Air Force, however, recognized
VVEDA as the local reuse authority, and Victorville eventually
annexed the former base in 1994.
   Refusing to take the decision lying down, Adelanto fought
back with a host of lawsuits challenging the environmental
impact report for the reuse of George. At the height of the court
battle, there were a total of 34 lawsuits that cost the parties at
least $11 million in legal fees, according to the Base Reuse
Report, a Sacramento-based newsletter. Adelanto's
litigiousness, however, ultimately backfired by dragging the
city through a series of costly legal defeats. In 1994, a
Riverside Superior Court judge ruled that Adelanto could not
use redevelopment money in its effort to acquire George. And
in a court-ordered settlement conference in January, 1995,
Adelanto finally stood down and relinquished its claim on
George.
   At the same time, however, Adelanto got into another dispute
with its neighbors over the water rights at George. When
George was an operational military base, the state created a
special arrangement for the city and the base to share a
common allocation of water. However, last fall, at the
instigation of the Mojave Water Agency, a Riverside County
judge issued a comprehensive settlement of all water rights
claims in the area. Under the agreement, all water users were
required to reduce their water use and the Mojave Water
Agency, which sells water to 250,000 residents in the High
Desert, was named special master. (CP&DR, November 1995.)
  Adelanto did not agree to the settlement, continuing to claim
it had a "prior and paramount" right to the waters of the
Mojave River. At this point, however, the Mojave Water Agency
shrewdly used Adelanto's financial troubles on the
redevelopment front as a lever to get the city to buy into the
water agreement.
  Adelanto's redevelopment troubles began in 1993, when the
San Bernardino County Grand Jury audited the city's attempt to
acquire George. The Grand Jury found that the city was
borrowing money from its well-funded redevelopment agency
(most of Adelanto is carpeted in redevelopment project areas)
while the redevelopment agency attempted to keep itself afloat
by issuing new bonds with interest rates higher than the city
could afford. In its report, the Grand Jury found that the
redevelopment agency had "exhausted all available resources
for operations," while lacking "any financial plan detailing its
projected expenditures, bond proceeds and other revenues
over the next several years."
  Based on the Grand Jury's findings, San Bernardino County
sued Adelanto in November 1993. The suit alleged that the city
had spent more than $4.2 million to acquire George, and had
illegally dipped into redevelopment funds for city operations.
The suit requested a group of city officials, including then-
Mayor Mary Scarpa, five city councilmembers and City
Manager Patricia Chamberlayne to pay the redevelopment
agency $6.34 million for the tax increment used to pursue
George and other non-redevelopment purposes. The settlement,
signed in October, required Adelanto to pay the county $5
million by the end of 1995, while allowing the Adelanto
Redevelopment Agency to borrow $100,000 of the county's
"fair-share" cut of the city's tax increment revenues to make its
bond payments. The settlement also authorizes Adelanto to
float the $55 million bond issue, which would enable the city to
restructure its existing bond portfolio and raise the additional
$5 million to pay off the county.
  Adelanto city officials were angered, however, when news
reports revealed that the City of Victorville had quietly lent the
county $800,000 to fund the lawsuit against Adelanto.
Victorville's role was surprising, because it appeared to violate
a January 1995 settlement agreement between the two cities
not to engage in further litigation. But Mike Rothschild,
Victorville Mayor Pro Tem, said in an interview Adelanto had
broken the peace by prosecuting the water issue, which he said
was part of the "total settlement package."
   The final humiliation for Adelanto, however, came in
November, at the hands of the water agency. The city clearly
needed to move ahead as quickly as possible on the new bond
issue. But the city could not move forward without the
approval of the Mojave Water Agency. The water purveyor,
however, threatened to sue Adelanto over a crucial part of the
recovery plan P the merger of two redevelopment areas in the
city P unless the city agreed to the regional water-sharing plan.
Advisers to the city pleaded with the mayor and
councilmembers to give into the water agency, and avoid
catastrophe.
  "Adelanto is insolvent," bond underwriter Tony Wetherbee
told the council. Said City Attorney Robert Corrado at the same
meeting: "Municipal bankruptcy is an ugly, ugly thing. We're
going to be in litigation forever." Later, when the council
appeared adamant against the water deal, he pleaded, "This is a
mistake of cosmic proportions and it means the end of
Adelanto as we know it."
  Notwithstanding those pleas, Mayor Judy Crommie and two
other council members voted against accepting the water plan.
Almost immediately after the meeting, according to local news
accounts, Crommie changed her mind, and scheduled an
emergency meeting for the following Thursday, when she
switched her vote.
   Adelanto had attempted to complete the restructuring of its
redevelopment bonds by December 31, 1995, which was the
deadline for the $5 million payment to San Bernardino County.
Because Standard & Poor rated the issue (BBB-) P an important
precondition of the bond sale P only in the closing days of the
year, the county granted the city an additional 10 days to the
city to make its payment; the new bond issue was scheduled to
close on January 9, according to the Victor Valley Daily Press.
Michael Sakamoto, acting city manager and the only Adelanto
official who would agree to be interviewed for this story, was
reluctant to comment on whether he thought the city had done
wisely in spending so much of its treasury fighting for George
and the Mojave River. "I don't want to comment on the
appropriateness or inappropriateness of any city action. The
City Council has instructed me to look for, and try to fashion, a
plan for the city to go forward," he said.

SACRAMENTO FINALLY GETS OUT OF HYATT HOTEL DEAL

  The City of Sacramento has finally cut all ties to the Hyatt
Regency Hotel, a 15-story luxury hotel across the street from
the State Capitol that the Sacramento Housing and
Redevelopment Agency helped subsidize. The deal releases the
redevelopment agency from its obligations without laying out
any cash.
  In December, the city agreed to surrender title to the land
under the hotel and the adjacent parking garage (of which the
redevelopment agency owned 48%) to Mutual Life Insurance
Co. of New York, the hotel's current owner. In exchange, the
redevelopment agency has been released from its obligation to
provide a $1.5 million annual subsidy to the hotel's owners for
the next 68 years.
  The Hyatt opened in 1988 as part of a public-private
partnership between the redevelopment agency and several
prominent private developers in Sacramento including Joe
Benvenuti and Gregg Lukenbill. It was designed as a
centerpiece project for downtown Sacramento. The Hyatt is the
most luxurious hotel in downtown Sacramento by far, and its
meeting room facilities are located close to the downtown
convention center. The city invested $13 million in the project
and agreed to the annual subsidy for 75 years, retaining
ownership in the land and part ownership in the parking
garage.
  But Benvenuti and Lukenbill ran into financial trouble when
the real estate market went sour in the early '90s, and MONY P
the primary lender on the project P assumed ownership in
1992. Ever since, MONY and the city have sought to reach an
agreement that would take the city out of the project
altogether.
  In 1991, on the eve of MONY's foreclosure, the city offered
$11 million in order to be released from its obligations but
MONY rejected the offer. Earlier this year, one consultant
suggested that the city offer MONY $7.7 million and the hotel
land. But Mayor Joe Serna and some other members of the City
Council were reluctant to agree to a deal that called for the
redevelopment agency to turn cash over to MONY.
  Under the deal as agreed, the redevelopment agency will not
be required to provide any cash to MONY. In fact, MONY will
actually pay the redevelopment agency $196,000 for a small
parcel of land at the southwest corner of the hotel. And if
MONY seeks to sell the property, the city could profit. Under
the deal, the city will receive 25% of any sales price over $62
million. MONY officials said they have not decided whether to
sell the hotel.

ACCORD REACHED ON VERMONT AVENUE
  Los Angeles's leading politicians have reached an agreement
with First Interstate Bank to reduce the city subsidy on the
controversial mixed-use project proposed for the corner of
Vermont Avenue and 81st Street.
  A city loan to buy the property was approved by the City
Council in November but vetoed by Mayor Richard Riordan.
(CP&DR, December 1995.) Subsequently, however, the council
passed a unanimous override of Riordan's veto. In the ensuing
weeks, Riordan, Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, and First
Interstate agreed to a new financial agreement which calls for
the bank to put more money into the project so the city's
subsidy will drop from $90,000 per housing unit to $70,000
per housing unit.
  Riordan opposed the project for two reasons: opposition from
a nearby homeowners association and the high subsidy per
unit. Riordan became interested in the project after
neighboring homeowners P U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters among
them P said they are opposed to any housing development
along the commercially zoned Vermont Avenue corridor. He
also questioned the $90,000 subsidy, which is close to double
the typical subsidy in a city-assisted housing project.
  Under the agreement with Riordan, the project still retains 35

moderate-income townhomes. Yet Riordan claimed victory for
the neighborhood, saying that he, unlike other politicians, had
listened to a group of residents who have traditionally been
disenfranchised.
  The Vermont proposal arose from a design/build competition
for affordable housing sponsored by First Interstate after the
1992 riots. The project is to be built on a mostly vacant 1.7-
acre site that served as the original location of Pepperdine
University. As currently designed, the project will include 35
townhomes (selling for between $88,000 and $130,000 each),
six small retail storefronts, and a satellite office of the USC
Business Expansion Network, to be located in an historic art-
deco building on the site. The project was strongly embraced
by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the area.

MALIBU PASSES GENERAL PLAN
  Facing a deadline from the Governor's Office of Planning &
Research, the City of Malibu has finally approved a general
plan that many council members claim is not restrictive enough
even though outside critics call it too restrictive.
  Approval of the general plan came more than four years after
the city's incorporation. The city has been engaged in a highly
political dispute with OPR last year over a time extension for
approving the plan. OPR denied a time extension after claiming
the plan does not provide affordable housing choices. Property
owners are likely to challenge the city's general plan in court
on housing element grounds.
  The plan calls for one-acre lots (or lower density) on 95% of
the undeveloped residential property in the city. A few
residential properties will be permitted to build four to six
units per acre. The plan also prohibits construction in areas
previously designated by Los Angeles County as
"environmental sensitive habitat areas" (about 9% of the city
altogether) and discourages development of sidewalks, street
lights, and other typical suburban infrastructure.
  The plan calls for permitting the construction of one hotel
near Pepperdine University, which city officials hope will
produce enough revenue to keep the city solvent.
  Property owners and state officials were not the plan's only
critics. Officials in nearby Santa Monica also complained about
the plan, which says Malibu's homeless will probably have to
find shelter in Santa Monica. Mayor Paul Rosenstein told the
Los angeles Times: "There have been rumors for yers that other
cities have been sending their homeless people to Santa
Monica. This is the first time I have seen a city admit it."

FISH & GAME FEE TO BE REINSTATED

  After a new legal challenge, a Sacramento judge has ordered
the state Department of Fish & Game to resume collection of the
Fish & Game environmental review fee. But the state has not
yet begun collection of the fee and the judge has not yet
decided whether to make collection retroactive.
  However, Fish & Game may seek a legislative solution by
asking the legislature to repeal the law that instituted the fee
in the first place. Fish & Game General Counsel Craig Manson
said the agency has spoken to some legislators and legislative
staff members but no bill has been introduced yet.
  The latest set of developments are the most bizarre yet in the
controversial history of the fee. On the one hand, Sacramento
Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Gunther has ordered Fish & Game
to start collecting the fee once again even though he had
previously ruled the fee unconstitutional. And on the other
hand, Fish & Game has taken an official position against the fee,
even though the agency benefits financially from it.
  Last summer, Fish & Game agreed to stop collecting the fee as
part of a legal settlement with several plaintiffs who
challenged the fee as an illegal tax. (CP&DR Environmental
Watch, July 1995.) The legal settlement came after Gunther had
initially ruled against the fee. But the settlement was
subsequently challenged by the California Association of
Professional Scientists (CAPS), the union that represents most
of the biologists who work for Fish & Game.
  CAPS argued that a state department cannot stop enforcing a
state law unless ordered to do so by an appellate court.
Gunther agreed and ordered the state to begin collecting the
fee again. However, in early January, the Fish & Game
Department had not yet begun to collect the fee because
Gunther had not issued a final written ruling.
  The Fish & Game fees were instituted by a bill that passed the
legislature in 1990. Local development applicants subject to the
California Environmental Quality Act must pay $850 for Fish &
Game to review environmental impact reports and $1,250 for
the department to review negative declarations.
  As Fish & Game's revenue from hunting and fishing licenses
has declined, the fees have provided a new source of revenue,
bringing the agency approximately $3 million per year, or
about 2% of its total budget. The fees have always been
controversial because no other state agency has statutory
authority to collect such fees and because local governments
were required to collect the fees for Fish & Game.
  The fee was originally challenged in 1991 by Redding
property owner Albert Mills. Mills claimed that the fee was not
a fee for service and therefore constituted a tax. He further
argued that as a tax, the fee was invalid because it did not pass
the Legislature by a two-thirds vote. Mills later formed
Californians for Fair Government Fees, representing 112 other
applicants who had paid the fees. Mills's lawyer, Walter McNeill
of Redding, filed a separate suit because of a Fish & Game fee
he had paid personally.
  Last March, Gunther ruled in favor of Mills, saying that the
fees were really taxes because the state had never determined
the actual cost of reviewing environmental documents before
passing the law. Pessimistic about the chances of success on
appeal, the agency agreed to a settlement which called for
refunds to Mills, McNeill, and members of Mills's group, as well
as a ban on further collection of the fees.
  Craig Manson, Fish & Game's general counsel, said that
collection of the fees would not begin until Gunther issued his
written ruling. He also said Gunther's ruling would address the
question of whether Fish & Game should collect fees
retroactively from applicants who had not paid the fees
because of the legal settlement.

ORANGE COUNTY NCCP RELEASED
   A wildlife habitat plan calling for preservation of 39,000
acres of undeveloped property has been released in draft form
by Orange County.  About half the preserve will consist of
coastal sage scrub, the habitat of the controversial California
gnatcatcher. The Orange County Planning Commission is now in
the process of reviewing the plan and the Board of Supervisors
is expected to act on the plan in March.
  The plan is part of the "Natural Communities Conservation
Planning" program undertaken by local, state, and federal
agencies in 1991 when the gnatcatcher was first proposed for
listing under state and federal endangered species laws.
  Called the Central/Coast NCCP/HCP (habitat conservation
plan), the plan calls for preservation of almost 20% of all
property in a 325-square-mile portion of Orange County that
stretches from Cleveland National Forest south and west to the
Pacific Ocean near San Juan Capistrano. Much of the land to be
preserved is owned by The Irvine Co. The plan is designed to
protect a total of 42 species, most of which are not currently
listed under the state or federal endangered species laws. Part
of the plan's purpose is to provide property owners with
assurance that they will have met their legal obligations if any
additional species are listed in the future.
  The Central/Coast plan is the first of three "sub-regional"
plans dealing with different areas of Orange County. An NCCP
plan for south Orange County is expected to be released later
this year, and a third NCCP for north Orange County is also in
the works. Three NCCP plans are also under way in San Diego
County.

PACKARD BELL DEAL LOOKS GOOD--BUT COMES AT A PRICE

  One year after the conversion of the Sacramento Army Depot
into a regional headquarters for Packard Bell, the deal is
shaping up as one of the most successful conversions of a
military base in California. Part of that success can be credited
to extraordinarily high subsidies provided by the City of
Sacramento. Also sharing the credit is a base-conversion
method known as an "economic development conveyance,"
which allowed local authorities to acquire the base at no cost in
return for sharing the profits of base reuse with the military.
  To date, the conversion of the Army Depot has far surpassed
initial expectations of both job creation and tax revenues.
Packard Bell had projected employment for 1,000 jobs at the
end of its first year; the company currently employs 5,000
people at the former depot, which is now an assembly plant for
personal computers. In addition, the new plant has spurred the
creation of an additional 2,500 to 3,000 jobs in the community
at large. The payroll, initially projected at $60 million to $80
million, is currently about $200 million. The plant also
generates about $1 million annually in local taxes. City officials
claim that enterprise zone tax credits have encouraged a
greater level of hiring and have taken several hundred local
residents off the welfare rolls.
  The Army Depot is the first closed military base to use the
economic development conveyance. Without it, Sacramento and
the Army might still be arguing about the value of the Depot,
according to Bill Farley, the city's economic development
manager. "When we first met Army officials, it was clear in a
few hours that we would never be able to agree on the value of
this real estate," he said. Army officials based their valuations
of the Depot based on the money they had poured into the base
over the years. City officials saw a group of outmoded buildings
that had to be rehabbed and marketed in a depressed real
estate market. Although he would not disclose the Army's
asking price for the Depot, Farley acknowledged that "we were
tens of millions of dollars apart. We could not even agree on
how to approach the method of valuing the property." In
contrast, "the economic development conveyance and the
profit-sharing provisions really took that extremely
contentious issue out of the equation," Farley said. Under the
plan, the city can sell portions of the base to private businesses,
and will eventually pass along $7 million to the Army in sales
and/or lease proceeds.
  Sacramento's initial reuse plan called for confining the Army
to a single portion of the base, while finding new uses for the
2.5 million square feet of buildings on the site. The city
planned to spend $19 million to clear out or refurbish old
Army  buildings ("These buildings were built to very high
standards, and they cost a fortune to demolish," Farley said.) To
market the Depot to private businesses, the city would
subdivide the base into individual parcels of 40 to 80 acres
apiece, and eventually to sell the parcels to private businesses
for a total of $15 million.
  Sacramento's great stroke of luck was the Northridge
earthquake of January 1994, which dislodged Packard Bell
from its plant in Northridge and sent the company looking for
potential new sites in less seismically active areas. In July,
Packard Bell officials asked Sacramento officials to identify
possible locations. The strongest selling point for the depot  was
the inclusion of the Army Depot in a State Enterprise Zone
program, which allows employers to take a tax credit of $6,000
for every disadvantaged worker hired, according to Debra
Nyland, an assistant economic development director for the
city. The credits enabled the company to save between $2 and
$4 million annually, according to Nyland.
  The agreement between the city and the computer maker was
a 20-year lease for 2 million square feet of rehabbed space for
$50 million. Annual lease payments began at $5 million and
drop to $2.5 million after the fifth year. In the tenth year the
company has an option to buy the property for $7 million, or
extend the lease for 35 years at $1.25 million annually. For its
part, the city provided a $17 million loan for tenant
improvements, plus a $9 million loan as a moving allowance.
The rents are higher in the first five years, so the city can
recoup the moving loan, which "was fairly risky because it was
unsecured," Farley explained. The tenant improvement loan is
being amortized over 12 years of lease payments.
  The city also indemnified Packard Bell against any costs
relating to environmental issues. Although the military clearly
has the responsibility for any environmental clean-up issues
under CERCLA, the federal Superfund law, the company
apparently wanted additional assurance.
  (Separate from the deal, the city also paid $800,000 to
relocate Vietnam Veterans of California, which was using the
site under the McKinney Act. The city has also requested other
public agencies, which have priority to take space in former
military bases, to forego the depot.)
  The Packard Bell lease negotiation was remarkable for its
speed. The company and the city struck a deal in less than two
months, and in September 1994 the deal was approved by
state lawmakers in 18 days. Packard Bell took occupancy of the
buildings in November, almost a month before it signed the
lease in December.
  The deal is all gravy to the Army, which spends nothing and
actually saves $1 million annually in maintenance costs for the
Packard Bell facility.
  Farley describes the economic development conveyance as "a
great tool" for local governments. Cities, he said, are "in the
business of redeveloping properties through various programs
the state has created. We never had a tool to accomplish the
same tasks with military bases, so this really makes the city
into a player in the redevelopment of the base."
  Despite the national publicity on the success of the depot
conversion, Farley was quick to add that the city's work is not
done. "As you start to build new facilities, and add onto the
existing infrastructure of the base, it leads to certain problems."
One problem is a $1 million "catch up" fee that the Sacramento
County regional sewer plant is attempting to charge the base.
(When the Depot was a military base, it was exempted from
sewer fees. Now that the depot is under local control, the
sewage plant is attempting to bill the depot for all the fees it
had not paid while it was still under military control.)
  Listed for closure in 1991, the 480-acre Depot officially closed
in March. The Army remains on 80 acres of the facility.

LISTING OF SPECIES STALLED

  A Republican attempt to block new endangered species
listings by denying appropriations for the listing process has
been upheld by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The
decision is likely to hold up attempts to list more than 100
species in California alone.
  Overturning a district court judge's ruling, a three-judge panel
of the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt missed the statutory deadline for making a decision on
whether to list the California red-legged frog as endangered.
But the court found that Babbitt "is unable to comply with his
listing duty under the Act" because Congress rescinded listing
funds in last year's appropriation and has continued the ban on
new listings in the continuing resolutions during this fiscal year
as well.
  The ruling came even though the statutory deadline for listing
the frog occurred before last year's appropriation bill was
passed.
  The ruling, written by Judge Betty Fletcher, contained a stern
warning against legislation by appropriation and stated that
the Endangered Species Act is still in full force despite the
appropriation bill. Quoting TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (the so-
called "snail darter" case), Fletcher said: "Repeal of legislation
by implication is disfavored," especially when "the claimed
repeal rests solely in an Appropriations Act."
  Ultimately, however, Fletcher concluded that Babbitt was
prohibited from making a final determination by the terms of a
rider to the 1995 appropriation bill. "The use of any
government resources P whether salaries, employees, paper, or
buildings P to accomplish a final listing would entail
government expenditure," she wrote. "The government cannot
make expenditures and therefore cannot act, other than by
appropriation."
  The red-legged frog case was widely watched because the
listing process has been halted on 120 species in California and
240 nationwide.
  The 1995 appropriation bill specifically rescinded $1.5 million
allocated for listing and determination of critical habitat and
also stated that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service cannot use any
other funds for this purpose. Originally passed on April 10,
1995, this rider has been contained in the continuing
resolutions passed to keep the government operating during
the recent budget negotiations.
  At the time the rider was passed, the Fish & Wildlife Service
was already engaged in lengthy litigation with the
Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara over the listing
of the red-legged frog. Under the Endangered Species Act,
Babbitt should have made a final determination on whether to
list the frog by July 19, 1993. When Babbitt missed the
deadline, EDC sued, but the two parties eventually agreed to a
settlement agreement requiring a final decision by November
1, 1993.
  Babbitt missed that deadline also, however, and EDC sued
again. Finally, the Fish & Wildlife Service published a proposed
listing on the Federal Register on February 2, 1994. Under the
Endangered Species Act, Babbitt then had one year P until
February 2, 1995 P to make a final decision on the listing.
Babbitt missed the deadline again, and EDC sued in May of
1995. By then, however, the appropriations rider was in effect.
  U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles issued
summary judgment in favor of the EDC and ordered Babbitt to
take a final action by September 15, 1995. However, the U.S.
Supreme Court issued a stay of this order and the Ninth Circuit
heard the case on an expedited schedule.
  In Fletcher's ruling, the Ninth Circuit ordered the final listing
"delayed until a reasonable time after appropriated funds are
made available" and ordered Real to establish the time frame.

STATE SUPREME COURT LAYS DOWN CC&R RULE

  The California Supreme Court has ruled that CC&Rs
(covenants, conditions, and restrictions) in two Woodside
subdivisions should be enforceable even though they are not
mentioned in the subdivisions' property deeds. In the process,
the court majority laid down a sweeping new rule to govern
the enforceability of private property covenants: If restrictions
are recorded before the sale of property, "the later purchaser is
deemed to agree with them."
  The controversial ruling may be the first step toward clearing
up a complicated real property law issue and is likely to have
an important impact on private land-use restrictions. "It's a
good decision," said UCLA law professor Susan French, one of
the leading scholars in the area of private covenants.
  But it may also lead to further confusion, because the court
declared that the new rule should be applied retrospectively
and because it declares that all information about a piece of
property need not be included in the deed. In a strong dissent,
Justice Joyce Kennard wrote that the ruling will transform
deeds "that on their face are unrestricted conveyances of the
landowner's entire interest into deeds conveying only a portion
of the landowner's interest." (French disputed Kennard's view,
saying that the restrictions will turn up in title reports.)
  The case drew the attention of many outside groups, including
the California Association of Realtors, the California Building
Industry Association, and the Coastal Commission, all of whom
intervened on behalf of the neighbors seeking to enforce the
CC&Rs. The Coastal Commission argued that if all CC&Rs must be
included in deeds, the agency's many not be able to enforce
conditions it imposes on new development projects along the
coast.
  The role of CC&Rs in land-use planning and regulation is
growing. Especially in California, more and more planned
communities are created with a "private" municipal
government made up of homeowner associations that enforce
private deed covenants.
  However, as CC&Rs have grown in number they have also
generated a lot of complicated litigation about how, when, and
by whom they can be enforced. French has called the law
surrounding CC&Rs "the most complex and archaic body of
American property law remaining in the 20th Century." Several
recent appellate court rulings have dealt with CC&Rs. Last
September, the Court of Appeal ruled that a homeowner
association may record a notice of violation with the county
recorder even though such actions are sometimes taken
because they are cheaper than suing the homeowner.
(California Riviera Homeowners Association v. Superior Court,
CP&DR Legal Digest, October 1995.) The Supreme Court
decertified this case shortly before issuing its ruling in the
Woodside case.
  The new case involves Jared and Anne Anderson, who bought
two parcels of property in Woodside and obtained a conditional
use permit from the city to operate a winery. The two parcels
were originally part of two separate subdivisions, each of
whose subdividers had recorded CC&Rs restricting the property
to residential use. Claiming that the Andersons had violated the
CC&Rs, a group of neighbors organized as the Citizens for
Covenant Compliance and sued the Andersons. However, the
Andersons claimed they had no knowledge of the CC&Rs
because there was no reference to them in the deeds of either
parcel they had purchased.
  San Mateo Superior Court Judge Harlan K. Veal ruled that the
CC&Rs were not enforceable, and the First District Court of
Appeal affirmed. But on a 6-1 vote, the Supreme Court
overturned the lower ruling and declared the covenants
enforceable despite the defects in the deed, establishing the
new rule in the process. "The CC&Rs of this case were recorded
before any of the parcels were sold ... they state an intent to
establish a general plan for the subdivisions binding on all
purchasers and their successors; and they describe the
property they are to govern," wrote Justice Armand Arabian
for the majority. "...Therefore ... the fact that the individual
deeds do not reference them is not fatal to their enforceability."
  To arrive at the new rule, Justice Arabian's majority opinion
reached deep into the legal history of easements, covenants,
and equitable servitude (sometimes known as restrictive
covenants), all of which seek to govern the enforceability of
private land use restrictions. Traditionally, a covenant is a
restriction that "runs with the land" because it affects the use
of the land in some way.  Beginning in the 19th Century,
English and then American courts adopted the doctrine of
equitable servitude, which permits enforceability of covenants
that would not be strictly enforceable under the doctrine of
covenants. Because the Woodside covenants impose a burden
on the property P rather than simply a benefit P and because
they are agreed to between grantor and grantee P rather than
between landowners P they fall under the doctrine of equitable
servitude and not covenants.
  Legal scholars have noted that legal doctrines surrounding
covenants and equitable servitude are similar and perhaps
should be combined. California law treats them similarly, and
in the majority opinion Arabian stated that the Supreme
Court's new rule should apply equally to both doctrines.
  In reaching his conclusions on the Woodside case, Arabian
said that the basic issue was not whether the restrictions run
with the land but whether they ever took effect in the first
place given the fact that they are not mentioned in the deeds.
The Andersons argued that the CC&Rs never took effect
because they were not mentioned in the deeds. But Arabian
said that accepting this argument would lead to "byzantine"
results. What if some deeds included the CC&Rs and others did
not? According to case law, he concluded, any property sold
subsequent to the first property whose deed mentioned the
CC&Rs would be subject to the CC&Rs P even if the particular
deed in question did not mention them. Claiming that this
greatly complicates title searches, Arabian said the result
would be a "crazy-quilt pattern of uses."
  In laying down the new rule, Arabian stated: "The overall
plan, and not individual deeds, should determine what
restrictions are in effect, and between whom." He also
concluded that the rule should apply retrospectively.
  In her dissent, Justice Kennard wrote that the new rule "blasts
a gaping hole through the structure of real property law that
has been painstakingly erected by the Legislature and by the
courts over the past century." She said that the rule will allow
"for the unilateral creation of enforceable land use restrictions,
contrary to established law," and that it will deny constructive
notice to land purchasers under state law. She also stated that
retrospective application of the new rule will wreak havoc
throughout the state. Noting that land subdivision in California
dates back to the 1860s, she said: "If the subdivider of any of
these thousands of lands recorded a plan of common
restrictions for the lots but conveyed the lots by unrestricted
grant deeds, retroactive application of the majority's new rule
will now bring those restrictions to life no matter how long
they have lain dormant."

APPELLATE COURT STRIKES DOWN FRESNO-AREA ARTS TAX

  Fresno's so-called "Arts-to-Zoo" tax violates the California
constitution because the organization that administers the tax
is a private entity, the Fifth District Court of Appeal has ruled.
  The Fresno Metropolitan Projects Authority was created by
the state legislature in 1993 as a vehicle for administering a
1/10-cent sales tax in the Freno area for cultural facilities.
Fresno-area voters approved the tax by a 57% majority in
1993. Under the Government Code, half of the tax proceeds are
distributed to the local zoo, the philharmonic orchestra, and
two museums, 25% are distributed for cultural programs, and
25% are distributed for a variety of other purposes including
capital improvements for cultural facilities. The authority is
governed by a 13-member board. As specified in the law, the
city and the county each choose one board member. The other
11 members are selected by such organizations as the Parent
Teachers Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the local
taxpayers association, the Farm Bureau, the Fresno-Madera
Central Labor Council, the League of Mexican-American
Women, the West Fresno Ministerial Alliance, and the local
division of the California Retired Teachers Association.
  The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association sued and claimed
that the state law creating the authority was a violation of
Article XI, section 11 of the state constitution, which prohibits
the legislature from delegating the power to tax to a private
entity. Fresno County Superior Court Judge Stephen J. Kane
ruled in favor of the Jarvis group and the Fifth District affirmed
his ruling.
  Before the Fifth District, the Metropolitan Authority made a
series of arguments, including the argument that it is a public
body because it performs public functions. But the court
pointed out that only two of its 13 board members are
appointed by public bodies. "The electorate cannot remove
those who are chosen as director of the Authority and the
electorate cannot remove those who choose," wrote Presiding
Justice James Ardaiz for the court. "But the electorate must
bear the consequences of the decisions of those who compose
the authority. ... As we see it this is a distinction that marks the
Authority as a private body."
  The Metropolitan Authority also argued that the tax was
levied by the people and not by the Authority, but the court
rejected that argument, stating that the law specifically
authorizes the Authority to levy the tax. The court also
concluded that voter approval did not render the constitutional
provision inapplicable to this particular tax, as the Authority
claimed.
  "The voters have no say in the matter of fund distribution for
the next 20 years short of repeal of the entire tax," wrote
Ardaiz. "This appears to us to be precisely the type of situation
the framers sought to avoid by prohibiting the delegation to a
private body of the power to tax."
  Finally, Ardaiz rejected the Metropolitan Authority's
argument that its "regional" nature exempts it from the
constitutional provision in question. The court's review of case
law, he concluded, "leads us to conclude that the present article
XI, section 11 means just what it says: that the  Legislature
may not delegate to a private person or body the power to levy
taxes. The section does not contain any exception for any
particular type of tax, 'regional' or otherwise."

SUPP EIS NOT NEEDED FOR DOPPLER WEATHER STATION

  The federal government did not need to prepare a
supplemental environmental impact statement for a Doppler
weather radar tower atop Sulfur Mountain in Ventura County,
the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled.
  Environmental review of the weather station was challenged
by the Environmental Coalition of Ojai and two individual Ojai
residents including actor Larry Hagman. Among other things,
the Environmental Coalition claimed that the federal
government should have prepared a supplemental EIS just for
the Ojai site and that other environmental documents should
have been updated to reflect new research about the
environmental health dangers of radiation from the weather
system. However, the Environmental Coalition has lost the case
all the way down the line and the Sulfur Mountain facility is
now in operation.
  The Sulfur Mountain station is part of the National Weather
Service's national modernization program known as NEXRAD
(for Next Generation Weather Radar). The system is being
constructed jointly by the Commerce, Transportation, and
Defense departments. Doppler radar systems must be located
away from "electronic pollution" contained in metropolitan
areas.
  The Environmental Coalition originally asked U.S. District
Court Judge Terry Hatter to enjoin construction of the project
but he refused and eventually he granted summary judgment
in favor of the government. The Court of Appeals affirmed his
ruling.
  The NEXRAD system has been the subject of a long series of
environmental documents, including a programmatic EIS and a
supplemental environmental assessment, which examined the
environmental impact generally and the radiation issue
specifically. Based on this information, the government chose
not to produce a supplemental EIS for the NEXRAD program
and instead filed a finding of no significant impact, or FONSI, in
1993. (A FONSI is the equivalent of a negative declaration
under the National Environmental Policy Act.)
  With regard to the Sulphur Mountain site, the government
produced an initial environmental assessment in 1986 and an
in-depth site survey in 1987 and as a result of those
documents issued a FONSI for the site in 1989.
  The Environmental Coalition's case contained two key
components. First, the Coalition argued that the government
should have prepared a site-specific EIS for the Sulfur
Mountain site. And second, the Environmental Coalition argued
that the government should have done a supplemental EIS for
the whole NEXRAD program after new research on the radiation
became known.
  In ruling for the government, the Ninth Circuit relied heavily
on the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Marsh v. Oregon Natural
Resources Council, 490 U.S. 360 (1989). In that case, the court
concluded that the federal government need not prepare a site-
specific EIS for every federal project. In the Sulfur Mountain
case, Judge Arthur Alarcon, writing for the Ninth Circuit, said:
"In its 1986 and 1987 site-specific EAs (environmental
assessments), the Government considered the environmental
impact of the NEXRAD installation on Sulfur Mountain. Having
determined that the Sulfur Mountain NEXRAD installation
would have no significant local environmental impact, the
government reasonably issued a FONSI in 1989 instead of
preparing a site-specific EIS."
  On the question of a supplemental EIS on the radiation issues,
Alarcon listed a long set of materials reviewed by the
government in its supplemental environmental assessment. "In
each instance," Alarcon wrote, "the Government found that
although initial studies suggested an association between RFR
[radar radiation] and ... diseases, more rigorous subsequent
studies either failed to confirm the initial results or yielded
negative findings." Based on this review the government
concluded that the radiation would not be an environmental
health hazard. "Accordingly, its previous conclusion that the
weather stations would have no significant adverse
environmental impact (published in the preliminary EIS)
remained valid," Alarcon wrote. "Therefore, the Government
determined that it was not necessary to prepare a
supplemental EIS."
  The court also rejected the Environmental Coalition's
argument that the government had failed to provide adequate
notice for the environmental documentation on both the radar
system generally and the Sulfur Mountain facility. The Ninth
Circuit concluded that Ojai citizens were not required to receive
specific notice on the nationwide system issues, and that the
government had satisfied notice requirements on the local
issues by filling documents  with state and local clearinghouses.

ECONOMYUS UP, BUT CONSTRUCTION ISNUT

  After showing signs of a rebound in 1994, California's
construction industry slid back into decline in 1995, reviving a
five-year dip in building activity in California. The renewed
slump confirms the break in relationship between building and
the rest of the economy here, and draws into question a range
of community development dictums that revolve around
growth.
  Two years ago, we announced that the sector that once set the
course of economic trends had instead become a follower
(CP&DR Numbers, January 1994). Last year, we reported that
construction experienced its first growth year in the last six
(CP&DR Numbers, January 1995.) All three sectors (residential,
non-residential, and heavy) experienced increases in total
construction dollars in 1994 relative to 1993, indicating that, at
long last, the building industry had rebounded.
  As it turned out, 1995 was the year that entertainment and
bio-tech replaced a goodly portion of the jobs lost in the
aerospace/defense industry, the year that home prices actually
began to climb in some of the state's zip codes, and the year
when even aerospace/defense saw some job growth linked to a
revival of some B-2 and  McDonnell Douglas passenger jet
orders. But the building industry took a dive again. With 10
months of data in hand, the Construction Industry Research
Board is forecasting a retraction year in total construction
dollars, led by slides in residential and heavy construction.
  If there is any economic bright spot, it is that the $29.9 billion
spent last year did not drop to the 13-year record low year of
1993, when only $28.8 billion were spent. The other positive
statistic is the employment data: though total construction
dollars are down, construction jobs enjoyed a second straight
year of growth.
  This is all quite confounding for industry watchers such as
Ben Bartolotto of the CIRB. After all, a year ago he had
predicted an 11.8% increase, rather than the 1.7% drop he now
estimates. (Final numbers will be available in March. ) "All of
the dynamics were in place: job growth, drops in vacancy P the
drop is frustrating," Bartolotto said. The job growth data
apparently reflects ongoing reconstruction or renovation that
does not show up in regular construction figures.
  Bartolotto suspects that the disconnect between employment
and housing demand may be resulting from lower levels of real
personal income compared to, say, 10 years ago. And this time,
L.A. cannot be blamed for holding the state back: of the 25
markets surveyed by CIRB, Los Angeles-Long Beach, along with
San Francisco and Santa Barbara County, were the only housing
markets that increased housing construction from 1994 to
1995. Rates from other types of construction varied widely be
region, but one thing has emerged as constant: the building
industry is not a reliable indicator of economic health in
California. And a healthy economy does not necessarily
translate into a booming building industry.
  The lesson may be an important one for planners, who should
P now more than ever P think about implementing community
goals in ways that do not rely on new construction activity.
  Which brings us to the forecast for building in 1996: Does
anybody still care? Once again, the CIRB calls for a comeback
year, with an 11.9% increase in overall dollar spent. This is
expected to be paced by a strong surge in housing construction,
with a 29.8% increase in activity over 1995. Cynical as one is
tempted to become about such forecasts, it is true that the
housing industry seems to be poised for some kind of
turnaround. Analysts have been saying that the pent-up
demand for housing may find an outlet as potential buyers
come to market in order to avoid the 2.5% increase in prices
expected in 1996. But one thing we have learned: We won't
draw any conclusions about the larger economy based on the
construction industry.

REMAKING DOWNTOWN FRESNO

  The Fulton District in Downtown Fresno has much in common
with other aging city centers across the state: high vacancy
rates in older buildings, out-of-date infrastructure, inadequate
parking, a perception of crime, and a general lack of vital
pedestrian activity. The district also has a number of positive
attributes, including a number of existing cultural institutions,
most notably the Fresno Metropolitan Museum, which attracts
250,000 visitors annually.
  The "Met," as it is known locally, is in an expansion mode, and
museum directors have acknowledged that a bigger and better
Met needs to be supported by other institutions in the
immediate area. The notion of a cultural district was already
suggested in the downtown master plan created in 1993 by
developer Wayne Ratkovich, and some city officials view the
area as the cultural center not only for the city but for a 125-
mile radius of the San Joaquin Valley. A team of consultants,
made up of Keyser Marston Associates, Barry Howard Limited,
and RTKL Associates Inc., have proposed a cultural district,
with the Met serving as the nucleus, surrounded by at least six
other museum or museum expansion sites, including new
locations for the Afro-American Museum and Arte de
Americas.
  The cultural district would be buttressed by an
entertainment/retail district immediately southwest, anchored
by that tried-and-true generator of urban foot traffic: a multi-
plex cinema, which is expected to bring in 1 million people
annually. The pedestrian quality of the cultural district could
benefit from another proposal to convert one-way streets to
two-directional traffic. Neo-traditional designers favor two-
way traffic as a means to slow traffic and make streets more
comfortable for pedestrians, although few cities have had the
gumption to convert one-way streets P a favorite of traffic
planners P back to two-way traffic.
  A strength of the plan is the high number of existing and
proposed museums oriented on Van Ness Avenue. The plan
identifies at least two vacant lots on important thoroughfares
as parking sites, which could blight the experience for
pedestrians, unless the parking structures incorporate street-
level retail. The plan has been approved by the museum's
board of directors, and is awaiting a vote by the Fresno city
council.
  1. The Fresno Metropolitan Museum. This well-attended
institution is the anchor of the area, and seeks to expand into
neighboring buildings (2) and (3).
  4. A multi-plex theater is the "traffic generator" of the Fulton
District, and is hoped to attract up enough visitors to activate"
the downtown district. To handle the parking, the museums
and other buildings would make parking available to the
theater on evenings and weekends.
  5. Multi-plex parking.
  6. Proposed future site of the Asian Museum.
  7. Proposed future site of the Afro-American Museum.
  8. Proposed future site of Arte de Americas.
  9. Fulton Street. Two-way traffic is proposed for this one-way
street.
  10. Van Ness Avenue.
  11. Existing theaters: the Wilson and the Warnor.
  12. Proposed museum/museum expansion sites.
  13. Proposed surface parking.
  14. Fulton Street.

Group Says Agriculture Helped by RFG Increases

A correlation between increased ethanol usage and the reformulated 
gasoline (RFG) program is clearly shown in the most recent gasoline
utilization numbers made available by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation.

States where RFG rules have been in effect show that the market 
percentage for ethanol blends has increased compared to the same
period in 1994, said Gary Goldberg, American Corn Growers 
Association president.

In traditional farm states, demand for ethanol has dropped, but it
has increased in midwestern states that are part of the RFG program.
While usage has dropped in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, 
Ohio and a whopping 46 percent in Oklahoma, it has increased by even 
larger amounts in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Nationally, RFG use is credited for a nine percent increase in
ethanol demand.  Said Goldberg, "To those in the ethanol industry
that have tried to downplay the importance of the Reformulated 
Gasoline program, these numbers speak for themselves...[and] clearly 
show that increased demand for ethanol and increased market 
penetration is driven by access to the RFG program."

Earlier in the year, the Energy Information Agency predicted that
yearly ethanol demand will increase from 1.6 billion gallons today
to 3.03 billion gallons by the year 2010.  The increase could mean a 
700 million bushel increase in yearly corn use.  But the increase 
will only occur if RFG programs remain in place, ACGA predicts.

Goldberg said different ways are suggested to expand ethanol's role,
but it is clear that "the RFG program is the most logical and
cost-effective means to grow the market."

Higher Speeds May Increase Smog Potential in CA

With increased speed limits in California -- from 55 mph to 65 mph 
-- the California Air Resources Board (CARB) is predicting that 
increased tailpipe emissions will cause the amount of ozone forming 
pollutants in the air to rise from one percent to three percent 
almost immediately.

But stronger regulations appear unlikely, since "We already have the 
nation's most effective motor- vehicle control," according to Jerry 
Martin, air board spokesman.  He agreed new regulations were 
possible, but were not being planned at the moment.

Worst hit would be the Los Angeles basin, which ironically had just
celebrated the cleanest air in more than two decades.  Two key
pollutants -- volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides 
-- are expected to create the increase in ground level ozone.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) said it
expects that between 12 and 18 tons of VOCs will be addded daily to
the 588 tons projected for 1996, and that nitrogen oxides would add 
14 tons daily to the projected 466 tons.

In the state capital, Sacramento, itself a bastion of bad air,
discussions are under way on whether the state will drop its
requirement that all cars sold in the state in 1998 be 
zero-emissions (electric) vehicles.  Another 14 tons could be added 
to pollutants if the requirement is dropped, the Coalition for Clean 
Air lamented.

All of the estimates, however, are based on the premise that all
drivers will ratchet up the speed they drive.  The California 
Highway Patrol (CHP) reports that since the new limits went into 
effect people continue to drive much as they had before -- at around 
70 mph.  A "creep" may manifest itself in time, CHP concedes.

Europe Reduces Duty on Imported Methanol

A recent European Union (EU) announcement said the first million 
metric tons of methanol to come through customs in EU countries will
only require duty of less than half the normal amount.

Not much impact is expected on the amount of methanol imported, nor 
on exporting countries, industry analysts say.

Users of methanol in the industrial sector wanted a duty-free quota
for methanol, as was permitted last year, but the EU chose instead
to cut the tariff to four percent rather than 8.1 percent on the 
first million metric tons.

Judith Speed, international methanol manager for ICI Industrial
Products, Inc., a European methanol producer, said that "Duty-free
and reduced duty quotas were designed to work in specific, abnormal 
situations."  She added that "If quotas are continually allowed, 
they set a precedent and then you may as well have them all of the 
time."

Speed said that last year's quota was regarded by European methanol
producers as "quite reasonable," but noted that by the time the
quota went into effect, prices had begun to drop and "there really 
wasn't any need for the duty-free shipments."

One methanol producer who ships to Europe said "A four percent
reduction in the European duty is not enough for us to divert our
normal export patterns."

Added Jim Thomas, vice president of market analysis for Houston's
Bonner & Moore Associates, "You can get all the methanol you want in
Europe right now."

Speed says that European producers are not worried about the quota,
but nonetheless the European Methanol Producers Association is
asking for an investigation into the quota on principle because 
"There is a lot of 'horse-trading' going on between countries, and 
we think that should be looked into," said Speed.

Mexico Is Undergoing Environmental Protection Revolution

     The Mexican government, headed by President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, is starting to seriously address a myriad of severe
environmental problems that 40 years of uncontrolled industrial
development have created.  Salinas' speeches, including his 1
November "State of the Nation" address, sound more like speeches
from "Green" conventions than those of a president of a third
world country, say political analysts.  Until recently the
environment had not been much of worry for Mexicans and their
government -- economic growth, illiteracy, and malnutrition were
the top priorities -- but Mexico's environmental problems --
especially in Mexico City -- are beginning to wake people up, say
observers.  For example, television programs, radio reports, and
banner headlines about the environment are commonplace in Mexico
today.  Mexico's intellectuals are also putting pressure on
government and industry to clean up and protect the environment.
"We have a silent disaster under way that is threatening Mexico's
development," Homero Aridjis, Mexican novelist and president of
the Group of 100, a group of prominent Latin American
intellectuals working to protect the region's environment.
     Mexico's environmental problems include Mexico City's
permanent blanket of brown smog -- the result of five million tons
of pollutants spewed into its air yearly by three million cars and
36,000 factories -- rivers and lakes polluted with untreated human
and industrial waste, rapid deforestation, and the polluted
US-Mexican border area littered with "maquiladoras," or inbound
assembly plants.
     The country's first environmental legislation controlling
emissions was passed in 1988, and the Ecology and Urban
Development Secretariat (SEDUE) showed industry it meant business
by conducting spot checks in April and May.  Two-thirds of the
industries inspected failed, resulting in hundreds of factories
being temporarily shut down and fined.  SEDUE kicked off the
campaign in March by closing a major state-owned oil refinery
operating in Mexico City.  "Industry didn't think it would happen;
they didn't believe we would enforce the law," said SEDUE
spokesman Eduardo Garcia.  The crackdown involved not only
Mexican firms, but also such multinationals as German chemical
giant BASF AG and US-based Dow Chemical Co.  "The law is being
enforced, and it's causing Mexican companies to run around like
chickens looking for help with and information on cleaning up
dirty emissions," said Alfonso Cipres of the Mexican Ecological
Movement.
     The Mexican government is also working closely with US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authorities to develop ways
to clean up and protect the Mexico-US border area from further
environmental contamination, which some critics fear is a
possibility if trade and industrial activity are allowed to flow
freely across the border.  President Salinas has acknowledged that
Mexico's border area needs cleaning up, but has steadfastly vowed
not to allow Mexico's environment to deteriorate further and
"become a haven for polluters" when, and if, trade barriers are
removed.  Mexico -- out of necessity -- is undergoing an
environmental protection revolution that promises to radically
change how things are done in Mexico, particularly the way
business is conducted.  In coming issues, EWLA will examine in
detail how environmental protection laws and regulations in Mexico
are affecting industrial operations.

Brazil Awaits Financing to Clean Up Sao Paulo's Polluted Tiete
River

     The state of Sao Paulo is preparing to start a US $1 billion
project to clean up the state's most important -- and polluted --
river, the Tiete, by the year 2005.  On 4 October, Sao Paulo
Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury, accompanied by other Brazilian
officials, discussed the cleanup plan and possible financing
arrangements with the president of the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) in Washington, DC, USA.  Brazilian officials hope the
IDB will finance about half the cost of the project, or about US
$500 million.  According to IDB officials, the bank is studying
the request and putting it through the normal review process,
which could take up to several years, before any decision is made.
However, one IDB official told EWLA that the bank feels it's a
worthwhile project that should be funded.  The rest of the funds
needed for the project are slated to come from Brazil's federal
government, Sao Paulo's state government, and private groups.
     The Tiete River runs from the Atlantic highlands in eastern
Sao Paulo through the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, where it
becomes highly polluted from 3.5 billion liters of mostly
untreated domestic (two-thirds) and industrial waste (one-third)
dumped into it daily, and then feeds into the river Parana.
Brazilian officials say that only about 16% of the waste
discharged into the river is currently treated.  Discharging
untreated waste in Brazil isn't illegal yet, but government
officials say that is about to change.
     The project's initial goal, according to Fleury, is to cut by
50% to 60% the amount of untreated effluent entering the river by
1994.  The funds are to be spent on constructing water-treatment
plants along the river to treat domestic waste.  The plan will
also require the more than 1,000 industries operating along the
river to clean up their own effluent; many industries plan to work
together and build common water-treatment plants to save money.
When the project is completed in the year 2005, "it will be
possible to fish once again in the river," said the governor.
     Despite Fleury's optimism, it appears the project may already
be heading for problems.  According to the state's constitution,
the first water project in the state of Sao Paulo must be the
cleanup of the Billings Dam area, a seriously polluted reservoir
that provides much of metropolitan Sao Paulo's water.  In
addition, environmentalists have criticized the governor's plan
because they say he will simply use the money to give
antipollution equipment to private industries to clean up their
effluents.

Argentina to Create Environment Secretariat by Early 1992

     Argentina plans to have its first ministerial-level
environment secretariat in place and operating by early 1992.
President Carlos Menem, seeking to be Argentina's "environment
president," recently created the secretariat by presidential
decree because the current constitution allows for only eight
ministries, and the environment had never been one of them.  "We
are in the process of amending the constitution to allow for a
secretariat of the environment at the highest level," said Alberto
Barbuto, president of the National Commission for Environmental
Policy.  The presidential decree allowed the Menem government to
legally circumvent the constitution until it's changed;
administration officials are working with legislators in both
houses of Congress and expect routine passage of the proposed
constitutional amendment when it is brought before Congress.
     The new secretariat, which will employ approximately 200
people, will be in charge of national environmental policy, help
Congress write modern environmental laws, and ensure that the new
laws are enforced, Barbuto told EWLA.  The secretariat will work
with the country's 23 provincial environment ministries on
environmental matters of overlapping jurisdiction.  Committees are
now writing coordinated environmental laws that will carry
penalties for offenders.  "Today, for example, there is no penal
code in Argentina for contaminating water, only for deliberately
poisoning it," said Barbuto.  A general environmental law will
outline basics, such as a requirement that all construction
projects conduct environmental impact studies.  More specific laws
will protect natural resources and establish toxic waste penal
codes.
     Critics charge, however, that in reality the Argentine
government has no real environment policy and is simply trying to
improve its "green" image by creating another government agency.
"If this government really wanted to come up with a national
environmental policy, it would be consulting with nongovernmental
organizations and industry, and would not be picking Maria Julia
Alsogaray, a person with no environmental protection background,
to head up the new secretariat," said Patricia Gay, executive
director of Friends of the Earth Argentina.  Environmentalists say
that instead of creating more agencies, the government should
concentrate on enforcing environmental laws and regulations, which
are now being "totally ignored by industry in Argentina."  Pedro
Tarak of the Foundation for Natural Resources and the Environment
doubts this new secretariat will ever write any environmental laws
 -- or enforce them -- because the existing agency, he said,
doesn't write laws or enforce them now.
     "The private sector in Argentina is starting to take
environmental protection more seriously, although the topic isn't
as intense here as it is in other parts of the world," said
industrialist Federico Zorraquin, president of Grupo Zorraquin, a
group of large industrial companies.  According to Jorge Rivara of
DuPont Argentina, there is indeed a group of industries --
especially chemical and petrochemical -- that are starting to
worry about the changes to come.  "However, they are waiting to
see how this new environment secretariat will operate and, above
all, how much power it will have," he told EWLA.  Zorraquin is
also a member of the Business Council for Sustainable
Development, an international group of business leaders
coordinating industry's contribution to the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in
1992.  He said the reason environmental protection isn't very high
on the business agenda in Argentina is because "Argentina's
environmental problems aren't very visible."  For example,
environmental degradation in Buenos Aires is mainly a problem in
the poorer sections of the city and doesn't directly effect the
majority of the population, according to Zorraquin.  Nevertheless,
he does believe that the government needs to strengthen its
ability to enforce environmental regulations.

Argentine Leather Processor Threatens Public Health

     The Argentine leather processing factory Inducuer, located in
the city of Florencio Varela (30 km southeast of Buenos Aires), is
threatening the local population's health as it continues to
allegedly discharge chromium illegally into nearby streams and
land.  (Chromium is a toxic metallic chemical element.)
     Although Florencio Varela officials have occasionally fined
 -- recently US $25,000 -- and temporarily closed down the plant
several times over the past two decades for local environmental
law violations, they have not closed down the plant permanently
due to economic considerations.  Company sources say privately
that they would prefer to close down permanently, putting 180
people out of work, before investing US $2 million needed to
remove chromium from its wastewater and properly dispose of the
waste material.  The federal government has not been involved with
this case because there is no federal law in Argentina prohibiting
the discharge of chromium, but this may soon change (see previous
story).
     Since the plant opened in 1974, many of the city's 6,000
residents have suffered from skin infections and lung and kidney
problems due to high levels of chromium in the water and air.  In
early October, two newborn infants in a neighborhood close to the
factory died from chromium poisoning.  The neighborhood's drinking
water, recently tested by local water officials, was determined to
be highly contaminated with chromium.  "The water even came of the
spout green, the color of chromium," said one water official.
Carlos Bralo, a lawyer representing the affected community, told
EWLA that new tap water standards are beginning to improve the
quality of water somewhat, but the air continues to be polluted
with chromium.  "We are breathing in chromium," he said as he
pointed to deteriorating metals on houses in the area.  Bralo has
filed a suit against Inducuer on behalf of the families who lost
their children, but observers say it will be years before there is
any justice.

Spanish Bank Funds Santiago Air Pollution Study

     The Banco Santander, a Spanish bank with subsidiaries in
Chile, is currently assembling a team of international
environmental experts who will collaborate with local
environmental officials and scientists at the University of Chile
to study Santiago's severe air pollution problem and come up with
viable solutions.  The bank initiated and is funding the year-long
project, which will cost an estimated US $250,000.
     Bank President Emilio Botin expressed the bank's desire to
organize and fund such a team to work on this problem while
visiting Chilean President Patricio Aylwin on 2 September in
Santiago.  Sources say Aylwin was appreciative and pointed out to
Botin that Banco Santander was the first and only private
enterprise in Chile to donate economic support to help fight the
air pollution problem.  At the meeting, Botin said: "I am
convinced that Santiago will resolve this problem, and we at the
Banco Santander will be very proud to have actively participated
in it."  According to Federico Ysart, corporate communications
manager with the bank in Madrid, Spain, the idea came from bank
employees in Santiago, "who live with the smog daily."  "The
bank's management in Spain saw this as a good opportunity to share
some of the benefits the bank has been enjoying from its
operations in Chile recently," he told EWLA.
     The environmental team, which begins work in November, will
consist of about 10 people.  "Although the team will principally
study sources of air pollution, it will also look at sources of
water and noise pollution," said Ysart.  Currently a steering
committee with members from the three institutions involved in the
project -- Banco Santander, University of Chile, and
Decontamination Commission for the Metropolitan Area -- are
selecting team members.  By this time next year, the team is to
publish its findings and recommendations in a so-called "White
Book," which will be presented to government authorities and the
general public for review and comment.
     According to Urban Air Pollution in Latin America and the
Caribbean, a report published in September by the Pan American
Health Organization, Santiago is the third most polluted city in
Latin America, just behind Mexico City and Sao Paulo, Brazil.
According to the researchers, the air pollution problem in
Santiago, while exacerbated by geographic and climatic conditions,
is primarily caused by mobile sources.  Mobile sources are
responsible for 83% of the total nitrogen dioxide emissions, 78%
of the hydrocarbons, and 98% of the carbon monoxide."

Chilean Officials Review Environmental Laws and Plan New Ones

     The National Commission for the Environment (CONAMA), Chile's
governmental agency responsible for coordinating environmental
policy, is currently preparing an inventory of existing envi-
ronmental laws.  The objective is to better organize current laws
on the books, and find out where more laws are needed.  CONAMA
officials say many of the environmental laws on the books in Chile
are unknown, due to a lack of past enforcement.  Rafael Asenjo,
executive secretary of CONAMA, estimates that the inventory will
come up with about 2,000 existing environmental regulations.
     So far, CONAMA has found that current environmental
regulations do not adequately assure the protection of public
waterways from industrial or municipal waste, nor do they require
that toxic waste be treated and disposed of safely.  Asenjo
concedes that his agency has no information on how or where the
country's toxic waste, mainly from industry and hospitals, is now
being disposed.  CONAMA officials have also discovered that there
are no laws requiring that environmental impact studies be
undertaken before major projects are approved.  This will change
shortly.  Asenjo told EWLA that CONAMA expects to propose many new
environmental laws by the end of the year, including one that
will require such environmental impact studies.  Although
environmental impact studies are not currently required, a
majority of the large firms operating in Chile reportedly already
conduct environmental impact and feasibility studies on their own.

Chilean Salmon Farmers Oppose Planned Aluminum Foundry

     La Cooperativa de Salmoneros de Aysen (COSA), an association
of salmon producers, is alarmed at the prospect of having an
aluminum foundry built near salmon farms in the Aysen region in
southern Chile, about 1300 km south of Santiago.  Proyectos de
Aysen SA, a Chilean company, and Noranda Inc. of Quebec, Canada,
want to construct an aluminum foundry and a 360 megawatt
hydroelectric facility in the Aysen region, which would cost US
$1.2 billion.
     Salmon farmers argue that the pristine fjords in the Aysen
region, where most of the salmon farming is done, would
undoubtedly become contaminated, hurting both salmon harvests and
the environment, with an aluminum foundry operating nearby.  The
Aysen fjords are one of the few ideal places in the world for
raising Coho salmon.  The region is expected to produce 4.5
million tons of Coho salmon next season, worth approximately US
$140 million.
     COSA officials point to instances in Canada and Argentina
where aluminum foundries have contaminated waters and damaged
salmon farms.  Alcan Ltd. in British Columbia, Canada, is running
an aluminum foundry similar to the one Projectos de Aysen intends
to construct in Chile.  Alcan's foundry has been discharging 400
metric tons annually of fluorine gases into the atmosphere.  COSA
says tests conducted on the Columbia River in Canada in the early
1980s indicated the presence of fluorine in the water.   Fluorine
is the principal chemical associated with the production of
primary aluminum, and adversely affected the health and survival
of salmon there.  A similar situation occurred in Argentina.  In
the early 1970s, Aluar SA built an aluminum plant in Puerto
Madryn, which has needed more than US $70 million worth of
environmental protection equipment installed in recent years.
Salmon producers also say that even with the best purification
systems only 98% of the fluorine produced can be removed from
waste effluents, and typically the percentage is much lower.  More
alumina and chemicals are also lost to the environment in the
loading and unloading of ships at the docks, they warn.
     Proyectos de Aysen, however, is trying to assure the salmon
producers that they plan to take every precaution to protect the
environment.  For instance, they intend to use a closed circular
suction system to load and unload materials to avoid anything
escaping to the environment.  In addition, Proyectos plans to
conduct a comprehensive environmental impact study, and says it
will be in "constant contact" with salmon producers.

Venezuela Takes Steps to Clean Up South America's Biggest Lake

     After years of studying the problem, it appears that the
Venezuelan government is now taking concrete steps to begin the
cleanup of South America's largest -- and possibly dirtiest --
freshwater lake, Lake Maracaibo located in northwestern Venezuela.
Venezuela's Ministry of the Environment and Renewable Natural
Resources (MERNR) recently contracted with Delcan International
Corp., a Canadian environmental engineering firm, to design and
manage the construction of two sewage treatment plants and six
pump stations for the lakeside cities of Cabimas and Ciudad Ojeda,
at a total cost of about US $52 million.  The cities, which have a
combined population of approximately one million people, have been
discharging untreated sewage into the lake for decades.  In
addition, an Israeli firm is currently building two sewage
treatment plants at the lake's biggest city, Maracaibo, which has
more than a million inhabitants.
     According to Pablo Emilio Colmenares, president of MERNR's
Institute for the Control and Conservation of Lake Maracaibo, the
Venezuelan government began looking into the need to clean up the
lake as early as 1977.  The government spent years conducting
studies, coming up with grand plans and writing environment laws,
but in essence accomplished nothing concrete until now.  "The lake
should be healthy and cleaned up to international standards by the
year 1999 with the installations of municipal sewage treatment
plants, and new, tough environmental laws in the works that will
stop industry from polluting the lake," Colmenares told EWLA.
Government officials concede that industry has found it easy to
pollute the lake over the years because the weak environmental
laws on the books haven't been enforced much.  Government
officials say that will change soon.  (EWLA will examine in the
next issue the new penal environmental law the Venezuelan Congress
is drafting.)
     Environmentalists are very skeptical of the government's
plan.  "For 30 years we have been hearing about projects to clean
up the lake, and so far we have seen nothing," said Aldemaro
Romero, executive director of the Venezuelan Foundation for the
Conservation of Biological Diversity.  Romero said that because
nothing has been done, the lake is "a complete disaster, filled
with mercury, sewage, agrochemicals, and oil."  As far as he is
concerned, the government is all talk and no action.  "I don't
believe that the government is going to sanction or close down
state-owned enterprises, and I will have to see these sewage
treatment plants up and running -- not plans on paper -- before I
believe it," he told EWLA.  Meanwhile, business leaders say that
although the program has been delayed for years, they believe that
growing public pressure on government and industry is getting
things moving.  Said Guillermo Cardenas of Petroquimicas
Venezuela, a state-owned petrochemical firm: "Environmental
consciousness is growing in Venezuela, especially around the
Maracaibo lake, and industry realizes it has to take steps to
clean up."

Peruvian Officials Push US Copper Mining Company to Cut Emissions

     Peru's Ministry of Energy and Mines recently ordered the
Southern Peru Copper Corporation (SPCC) to completely clean up its
sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions and other pollutants within the
next five years by building sulfuric acid plants and taking other
environmental remediation steps at its main site in the southern
coastal city of Ilo.  Such action will cost the company an
estimated US $90 million.  (Sulfuric acid plants capture SO2
emissions from smelters and turn them into sulfuric acid -- a
marketable commodity itself -- resulting in less atmospheric
pollution.)  SPCC, 52% of which is owned by the North American
copper giant ASARCO Inc., mines 60% of Peru's annual copper
production, making it the country's largest copper mining outfit.
     SPCC officials say, however, they were involved in initiating
this project as well and therefore are not being "ordered" to
clean up emissions.   "When the government of Peru issues an
order, it does so only after things have been agreed to," said an
ASARCO official.  But the same official admitted that "Latin
American countries are all becoming much more environmentally
aware, and this whole effort is an outgrowth of that."
     A multisectoral commission was convened in 1989 to study the
pollution problem at SPCC and develop a solution.  The commission
issued a report, which then became a supreme decree in 1989,
outlining short-, medium-, and long-term steps that SPCC needed to
take to rectify the situation at Ilo.  SPCC cooperated and
outlined steps it would take, including construction of a 140,000
ton-per-year sulfuric acid plant, at a cost of US $76.6 million,
which will treat 35% of the SO2 emissions produced at its Ilo
foundry.  SPCC will also pipe the tailings from the Cuajone and
Toquepala mines offshore at the bay of Ite, at a cost of US $16.93
million plus yearly operating costs of US $500,000.  The company
has also promised to build a water-treatment plant to treat the
sewage from its camp, Ciudad Nueva, in Ilo.  The commission
determined that a 140,000 ton-per-year sulfuric acid plant would
not be enough to clean up the emissions, and told SPCC that it
would have to double the capacity of the plant to 300,000 tons
within five years to take care of all the emissions.  "SPCC wasn't
planning to use all the emissions from its smelters to produce
sulfuric acid," said Manuel Pulgar Vidal, an environmental lawyer
at the Peruvian Environmental Law Society.
     SPCC has appealed the commission's decision.  The copper
company is reluctant to increase the sulfuric acid plant's
capacity to 300,000 tons per year because, company executives say,
the domestic market for sulfuric acid isn't large enough to absorb
all of the sulfuric acid that would be produced by such a large
facility.  They also say SPCC isn't well-positioned to compete in
the international sulfuric acid market.  However, SPCC is coming
up with uses for their sulfuric acid.  Sources told EWLA that SPCC
has begun working on a heap leaching project, which will require
the use of sulfuric acid to exploit several million tons of copper
oxides and secondary sulfates that have accumulated at their
Toquepala and Cuajone mines.  Officially, however, government and
company officials are currently negotiating to resolve their
differences.

Environmentalists Force Texas Oil Company to Scrap Exploration
Plans in Peruvian Nature Reserve

     Texas Crude Exploration Inc. of Houston, Texas, USA, decided
in September not to explore for oil in Peru's Pacaya Samiria
National Reserve, even though the Peruvian government had
tentatively approved in early April a US $24 million oil
exploration contract between Texas Crude and Petroperu (the state
oil company) for a one million-hectare northern jungle oil block,
known as Block 61.  Texas Crude's decision came in the wake of
protests by environmental groups and congressmen in Peru and the
US who argued against oil exploration in the wildlife reserve.
The company received over 1,000 protest letters, and an
environmental group picketed its Houston offices.
     Environmentalists bolstered their campaign with environmental
legislation enacted in September 1990 by President Alberto
Fujimori.  The legislation outlawed exploring for or exploiting
nonrenewable resources in a reserve.  The government, however, was
interpreting the law its own way and was set to give Texas Crude
the go-ahead.  After Texas Crude gave up its exploration plans,
the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Ministry of Agriculture
repealed this law, known as article 71, due to pressure from local
investors.  Environmentalists, who are working to restore it, say
that foreign oil companies will still look carefully at where they
drill in the future.  Texas Crude said the whole episode has cost
them at least US $1 million: $500,000 on seismic data it bought
from Petroperu and another $500,000 it will now have to spend to
clean up its image in the US.
     The block was especially attractive to Texas Crude because of
its potential oil-bearing structures and its proximity to the
North Peruvian Pipeline.  The 856-km-long pipeline takes Amazon
crude oil from producing fields to Petroperu's marine terminal at
Bayovar on Peru's north coast.  Created in 1982, Pacaya Samiria is
a vast, swampy 2.08-million-hectare network of oxbow lakes,
lagoons, and flooded forest that is also home to the almost
extinct Amazon manatee and the pink river dolphin.  In the 1970s,
exploration companies pulled out of the area after drilling three
dry wells and making one noncommercial find.  Petroperu, however,
still operates in the reserve.  The cash- strapped state oil
company's environmentally unsound operations are a result of poor
maintenance and sloppy management, say environmentalists.
According to the Iquitos-based Institute of Amazonian Research,
over 200 hectares of jungle surrounding Petroperu's wells in
Pacaya Samiria are already contaminated by untreated water and
toxic chemicals used in drilling operations.

Peruvian Green Law Faces Uncertain Future

     Peruvian environmentalists fear that a new private investment
law being drafted by the government could sabotage sweeping
environmental legislation signed by President Alberto Fujimori in
September 1990.  Undermining the green law, Peru's first, wouldn't
be new to the Fujimori administration.
     Earlier this year the Fujimori government repealed two
important articles in the environmental law when it passed
petroleum and agrarian investment laws.  The agrarian law, for
instance, repealed article 71 of the environmental law, which
prohibited the exploitation of nonrenewable resources in protected
areas.  Article 71 formed the legal basis for environmental
lawyers' arguments that stopped Texas Crude Exploration Inc., a
petroleum company based in Houston, Texas, USA, from exploring for
oil in the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve.  (See previous story.)
     Industry in general, and the mining and petroleum sectors in
particular, have been especially critical of the controversial
green law.  For example, Luis Rodriguez Mariategui, former
president of the National Society of Mining and Petroleum, sees
environmental impact studies, which are stipulated in the law, as
just one more obstacle to starting up business ventures in Peru.
"The cost of an environmental impact study carried out by a local
company can run anywhere from US $20,000 to US $120,000, depending
on the size and complexity of the job," he said.  However,
Environmental Services of Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, which has
carried out environmental impact studies in Peru for such
companies as Mobil Exploration & Producing Peru, a division of
Mobil Corp., New York, USA, is telling its clients that "to meet
the full letter of intent of the environmental law an
environmental impact study would cost from US $400,000 to US
$500,000."
     Meanwhile, efforts by a multisectoral commission appointed by
Fujimori to outline regulations for the environmental law have
been stymied at the cabinet level.  Jorge Caillaux, president of
the Peruvian Environmental Law Society (SPDA) and a former member
of the commission, blames the impasse on the Fujimori
administration's "lack of political will" to make environmental
protection a priority.

Environmental Articles Included in Colombia's New Constitution

     Environmental protection is on the front burner in Colombia,
as evidenced by the passage in August of the country's new
constitution containing 43 articles specifically addressing
environmental protection.  The old constitution did not mention
the environment.  The environmental articles range from
prohibiting nuclear and toxic waste from entering the country to
requiring the government to protect the nation's biodiversity and
undertake environmental awareness campaigns.  The constitution
also mandates that the principles of sustainable development be
adhered to when exploiting natural resources, and gives
individuals, even though they may not have been directly affected,
the right to bring legal action against polluters.  According to
Guillermo Perry, Colombia's ex-minister of mining and energy, this
means that companies or individuals damaging the environment in
Colombia will now be held legally responsible, and will pay fines
and be forced to clean up their environmental damage.
     A new Congress, to be elected by December, will develop the
specific laws and regulations needed to comply with the new
constitution.  However, the government in power has already taken
some concrete steps to bridge the gap between the ideal
environmental goals set forth in the constitution and what really
occurs.  According to Manuel Rodriguez Becerra, director of
Inderena, Colombia's environmental protection agency, the
government approved in August the National Environmental Policy
Plan (NEPP), which outlines how the government plans to enforce
the environmental articles mandated in the constitution.  "The
NEPP calls for the complete overhaul of the government's existing
environmental protection sector, which is currently very weak,
uncoordinated, and operates on a shoestring budget," said
Rodriguez.  The new budget should about double, with money coming
from new taxes on firms exploiting nonrenewable energy sources,
and fines for violating environmental laws.  Rodriguez says the
government intends to create a Ministry of the Environment and a
National Environmental Council, which will include representatives
from all government ministries.   The government also will create
a series of decentralized regional environmental protection
offices throughout the country to carry out protection programs
and law enforcement.
     The environment will also become an important factor in the
marketplace, say government officials.  For example, the NEPP
proposes pollution taxes for polluters and subsidies for companies
that switch to cleaner, more environmentally benign technologies
and undertake reforestation and conservation projects.

Columbian Salt Plant Shut Down for Polluting the Rio Bogota

     In September the Colombian government decided to permanently
shut down Alcalis de Colombia, an old state-owned sodium chloride
processing plant that operated along the Rio Bogota, just a few
kilometers from downtown Bogota.  The reason was that an
environmental impact study performed by the US-based consulting
firm Arthur D. Little concluded that the factory was responsible
for most of the pollution found in that river.  Alcalis, which
produced 18,000 metric tons of sodium chloride yearly, was
discharging about 680 metric tons of chloride into the river each
day, five times the permitted level.
     The Public Interest Defense Foundation, which demanded that
the government close down the factory three years ago, said the
extremely high concentration of chloride in the river (213 parts
per million, against a permissible level of 150) was a serious
health threat to the local population, as well as nearby farming
and pasture lands.  Sources say that some pastures and cows in the
area may have been contaminated by the river's polluted waters.
     The National Council of Social and Economic Policy (NCSEP), a
high-level interministerial council operating under the president
of the republic, Cesar Gaviria, made the final decision to close
the factory.  NCSEP authorities admit that the plant was closed
down for economic, as well as environmental reasons.  "Alcalis was
using old technology, in debt, and losing money," said one
official.  NCSEP calculated that the state would have had to
invest more than US $10 million in new, cleaner technology for
Alcalis to meet the current environmental regulations.  The 300
workers who lost their jobs due to the closing are demanding that
the government help them.

Texas Petroleum to be Fined for Polluting Colombia's Waters

     Colombian environmental protection authorities are
threatening to fine Texas Petroleum Company, of Dallas, Texas,
USA, for not properly treating drilling operation wastewater from
its Velazquez fields.  Authorities say the wastewater is polluting
the Magdalena River, Colombia's most important river.  "There is a
strong possibility that Inderena [the government agency in charge
of protecting natural resources and the environment] will be
sanctioning Texas Petroleum for contamination of waters near its
Velazquez fields," said Alfonso Avellaneda, head of the
environmental department at Inderena.  "Our legal department will
be announcing the sanctions shortly, and these may include a fine
or the closure of the Velazquez fields."
     Inderena officials claim that Texas Petroleum, knowing that
Inderena officials could not (until quite recently) inspect the
area because it was controlled by paramilitary groups, was
deliberately discharging untreated effluent into two streams.
Furthermore, Texas Petroleum allegedly tried to deceive Inderena
officials when they inspected the area.  Avellaneda said Texas
Petroleum stopped the discharge of all effluent to one of the
streams and tried to convince Inderena authorities that the stream
with no effluent was the one that received all the treated
effluent.  Texas Petroleum maintains that the Inderena inspector
confused the two streams due to a lack of familiarity with the
area.  "We clean up effluents as a matter of course, as you would
sweep and clean your house," said Joaquin Escobar, chief
environmental officer for Texas Petroleum in Columbia.
Furthermore, Inderena says there's a big difference between the
way Texas Petroleum and Colombia's oil company (Ecopetrol) operate
in the area.  "We want to demonstrate with these sanctions that
it's possible to exploit the oil in this area without
contaminating its waters, as Ecopetrol does," said Avellaneda.
Despite all the rhetoric from the government, Texas Petroleum says
it has yet to be officially contacted about the matter, and argues
that it is innocent.  "Our conscience is clear, and we are certain
that once the technical information is examined, the company's
worldwide reputation for environmental excellence will be
confirmed," said Escobar.
     In 1987, Texas Petroleum was admittedly involved in
contaminating La Cienaga de Palagua, a freshwater lake near its
Velazquez fields.  It discharged into the lake salty wastewaters
loaded with chlorides, strontium, vanadium, lead, and mercury,
resulting in the death of millions of fish.  Ecopetrol was also
implicated in this environmental disaster.

Bolivia to Enact Sweeping Environmental Legislation by Year's End

     The Bolivian Congress is putting the finishing touches on the
country's first-ever piece of comprehensive environmental
legislation.  The environmental bill, which is expected to become
law before the end of the year, will also create a
ministerial-level National Environment Secretariat responsible for
developing appropriate regulations and seeing that they are
enforced.  "The principal goal of this legislation is the
protection and conservation of the environment and natural
resources in Bolivia," said Gerardo Aguierre, Bolivia's Secretary
General of the Environment and one of the bill's authors.
"Bolivia needs to develop economically, but not at the expense of
the environment; therefore, there will be incentives for
businesses to protect the environment as well as penalties for
noncompliance," he told EWLA.
     When this bill becomes law, say its drafters, the conduct of
business will change drastically in Bolivia.  For example, fines
and prison terms of up to 10 years will await those who import or
traffic in toxic waste in Bolivia, and for those who bring into
the country contaminating technologies that have been outlawed in
their country of origin.  In addition, the law will establish
penal codes for polluting the air, water, and land.  Environmental
impact studies will be required for all new projects, both public
and private, before authorities grant approval.
     Bolivian environmentalists are generally pleased with the
bill, although they say developing regulations and enforcing them
will be a tough task.  "The fact that there is an environment bill
that will soon become law is a big step in the right direction,
but we have to make sure that the laws and regulations are
enforced," said Christian Vallejos of the Friends of Nature
Foundation, based in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.  Luis Alberto Rodrigo,
director of the Environmental Defense League, an umbrella
environmental organization in Bolivia, praised the government for
having the political will to work with many diverse groups to come
up with the comprehensive environmental bill, but likewise
expressed reservations about how effectively the new laws will be
enforced.  "I feel that it will be very hard for the government
to enforce the laws and regulations without adequate mechanisms
and funds," he told EWLA.  He believes that industries operating
in Bolivia will have to start taking environmental protection very
seriously.
     The legislation originated about a year and a half ago in the
Environment Committee of the House of Deputies, the lower house in
the bicameral parliament.  For the executive branch, the office of
the Secretary General of the Environment was also involved in
drafting the bill.  Two previous environmental bills did not
survive, according to Aguierre, because they tried to cover too
much and thus were too vague.  The current bill, however, is
expected to survive the process and become law.  "A general draft
of the bill unanimously passed in the House in early October, and
now legislators are carefully reviewing each of the 121 articles
and making any needed changes," Aguierre told EWLA.  Once the
House passes the entire bill, including all of the articles, it
will go to the Senate for a similar process.  But if the Senate
makes any changes, then it will have to be approved again by the
House.  The exact same bill has to be approved in both chambers
before it can go to the president of the republic, Jaime Paz
Zamora.

Central American Nations to Ban Toxic Waste Imports

     The Interparliamentary Central American Commission of
Environment and Development (ICACED), which convened with all its
42 members for the first time 23-26 October in Guatemala City,
Guatemala, urged all member nations to ban the importation of
toxic waste.  "We recognize that we have serious environmental
problems to address, the principal one being to protect Central
America from the industrialized nations' intent on making us their
toxic waste dump," said Arturo Amiel Escobar, a Guatemalan
legislator and the general coordinator of the event.  The
commission, which is made up of legislators from each country's
congressional environment committees, also called for steps to be
taken to clean up Central America's cities, and halt deforestation
on the Central American isthmus.
     Panama and Belize are the only two Central American countries
that have already outlawed toxic waste imports, but sources say
the remaining five are not far behind.  "Following the meeting,
the Guatemalan Congress began working on modifying the nation's
environmental law to include the prohibition of any type of toxic
waste from entering this country," Amiel told EWLA.  In addition
to calling for a ban on toxic waste imports, the participants at
the meeting also called on Central American industry to work
together with the governments to protect the environment.  "Our
objective is to give the private sector incentives to protect the
environment, and work toward a consensus between government and
industry on how to protect the environment, because otherwise it
won't work," said Amiel.
     The ICACED was created in August 1990, with the ratification
of the Central American Environmental Protection Agreement by the
member nations.  The Central American presidents decided at a
summit in February 1989 to create the pan-Central American
organization to allow the region's governments to work together to
develop coordinated environmental laws.  The commission's
executive committee, which consists of the presidents of each
country's congressional environment committee, meets every three
months to discuss legislative initiatives in the areas of
environmental protection and economic development and takes back
the commission's recommendations to their colleagues for action.

"Chemical Prospecting" Unites Costa Rica and US Pharmaceutical
Firm

     Merck & Co., Inc., one of the word's largest pharmaceutical
firms, has agreed to pay a Costa Rican conservation group US $1
million to provide Merck with plant and insect samples that might
lead to the development of new products.  The two-year renewable
agreement is believed to be one of the first in the world, said
Rodrigo Gamez, director of Costa Rica's nonprofit National
Institute of Biodiversity of Costa Rica (INBio).  INBio will
supply Merck with the chemical makeup of environmental samples
exhibiting desirable characteristics, such as freedom from fungus
or other biologically destructive organisms.
     The agreement calls for INBio to receive royalties from the
sales of any marketable products that result from the research.
INBio will use some of the US $1 million to pay for certain
start-up expenses, but part of the money, and later a percentage
of the royalties, will be earmarked for Costa Rica's conservation
efforts, including its famed national parks system, which covers
25% of the country.
     "This agreement gives Merck access to the amazing collection
of biological specimens found in Costa Rica, while working with an
organization that will protect and conserve the habitats from
which these samples are drawn," said Merck's Pamela Adkins.  Gamez
said other large companies are interested in the idea of "chemical
prospecting," but he was reluctant to reveal who they were.  He
was optimistic, though, that agreements such as the one with Merck
could become a lucrative source of income to the country.  "This
could become as lucrative as the country's coffee and banana
exports," he said.
     The INBio, created in 1989 at the recommendation of the Costa
Rican government, is currently engaged in the inventory,
identification, and classification of the country's diverse wealth
of flora and fauna.  At least a half a million species of
organisms exist in Costa Rica's tropical habitat.

EC Breaks With Free Trade Dogma in Landmark Waste Accord

     Shattering visions that Europe's giant single market for
goods should extend to trash too, the EC's environment ministers
sealed an historic agreement on 20 October that allows governments
to turn away shipments from other EC members of waste destined for
disposal in dumps or incinerators.
     For the first time ever the ministers also convinced the
European Commission, the Community's executive, to let them base
the packet of new waste rules on the environmental provisions of
the EC's treaty rather than on articles that promote open trade.
The move represents an almost heretical departure from the
Commission's long-standing dogma that waste should be considered
as a tradeable commodity, and opens the door for governments to
operate tougher national restrictions than the EC text foresees.
     EC Environment Commissioner Karel Van Miert defended the
Commission's capitulation as a one-off concession granted in the
face of enormous political pressure for stringent waste trade
restrictions from several governments, particularly France.  "What
we accepted was that the logic of the internal market should not
prevail" when it came to combating "waste tourism," he said.  The
decision did not signify any lasting change in the Commission's
waste policy, he argued.
     But triumphant French officials hailed the executive's
decision as a major victory for the environment over free trade,
as well as a crucial precedent for the Community and, more
importantly, efforts to reform the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT).  "The text clearly gives preeminence to
environmental protection over commerce," said French Environment
Minister Segolene Royal.
     Secretary-General of the European Federation of Waste
Management Dieter Vogt told EWWE he expected that Germany would
now seek a similarly nonharmonized approach to proposed EC
packaging legislation so that Bonn could maintain its far-
reaching national recycling rules, which other countries complain
pose a barrier to imports.
     Private court action seems likely to be launched sooner or
later to determine whether the text agreed by the Council of
environment ministers is legal under the EC's founding Treaty of
Rome.  Although Van Miert told ministers that the Commission did
not intend to challenge its legality -- a categorical assurance
that took Commission waste experts by surprise -- waste industry
officials said they would consider taking legal action to have the
legislation annulled on the grounds that it breaches the treaty's
free trade provisions.

A Panoply of Rules

     The regulation1, arduously negotiated over almost two years,
amounts to a landmark panoply of new rules for controlling
cross-border trade in waste not only within the 12-member bloc,
but also with the rest of the world.
     It covers virtually all kinds of waste except nuclear
materials, for which the EC has separate rules.  A key aim is to
bring EC practices into line with the requirements of the 1989
Basel Convention, which seek to limit international shipments of
hazardous waste, so that the Community and national governments
can ratify the pact.  Instead of distinguishing between hazardous
and nonhazardous waste, the regulation tailors the severity of its
control mechanisms according to whether trash is destined for
final disposal or for "recovery" -- meaning re-use, recycling, or
incineration to produce energy.  Controls on waste for disposal
are strictest.  The regulation bans the export of trash for
disposal to all countries except to European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) states that are also parties to the Basel
Convention.
     Export of waste for recovery is also banned in principle but
permitted to three groups of nations: members of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that have agreed
to apply a common system of controls on movements of such waste
among themselves (so far Japan has not); parties to the Basel
Convention; and nations with which the Community concludes
agreements or arrangements guaranteeing, as the Basel Convention
requires, "environmentally sound" management of the waste at its
destination.
     The inclusion of this last group allows the Community to
continue exporting recoverable waste, including toxic materials,
to many developing or newly industrialized countries as well as to
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  (This will not apply
to 69 countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Rim, to
which the EC has banned all waste exports at their request).  The
environmental organization Greenpeace accused the ministers of
hypocrisy over this decision, arguing that all waste exports to
these states should be prohibited since unscrupulous traders were
increasingly using the pretext of recycling to dump hazardous
garbage in nations with inadequate import controls.
     The export rules also fall short of meeting the European
Parliament's repeated calls for a halt to all EC waste exports to
countries outside the OECD, the club of rich industrialized
nations, from the year 2000.  Ministers went some way toward
satisfying those demands, however, by building in a series of
safeguards.  All exports will be forbidden when a country has not
specifically consented to receive the waste or when authorities in
the EC nation of dispatch suspect it would not be treated in an
environmentally sound way.
     Moreover, the Commission will periodically review the
third-party agreements -- for the first time by the end of 1996 --
and can propose a ban on exports if the environmental guarantees
turn out to be insufficient.
     The regulation's innovation, however, is that for the first
time it explicitly permits public authorities within the Community
to entirely ban or systematically block imports of nonrecoverable
garbage from other EC states.
     The provision is inspired largely by France's decision in
August to ban imports of household waste for disposal in French
landfills after potentially hazardous hospital garbage was
discovered mixed in with some consignments from Germany.  Bonn's
support for the ban -- once it had swallowed its anger at the lack
of warning from Paris -- was vital in getting the rest of the
Council to back France's restrictive approach.  Having exported a
staggering 700,000 metric tons of household waste to French tips
last year, Germany is now having to redouble efforts to build up
its waste disposal capacity after years of public opposition to
construction of new facilities.

Accord Cites EC Treaty

     The text agreed by ministers stipulates that, to put into
practice the principles that waste should be disposed of as close
as possible to its source and that both the EC and its individual
members should become self-sufficient in waste disposal, "member
states may take measures in accordance with the [EC] treaty to
prohibit generally or partially or to object systematically to
shipments of waste."
     Governments will not be allowed, however, to keep out imports
of hazardous waste from other EC countries that produce so little
that it would be uneconomical to build their own disposal
installations.  This stipulation is intended to ensure that small
states like Luxembourg, Ireland, Portugal, and Belgium get
continued access to specialized disposal facilities elsewhere in
the bloc.
     Van Miert said he had insisted that ministers insert the
reference to the treaty, the EC's equivalent of the Bible, to lend
the regulation a stronger Community dimension and avoid giving the
impression that it allowed the "renationalization" of waste
policy.  "It was important to have the reference to the treaty so
that we were not just reimposing national boundaries," he told
reporters.  Van Miert also persuaded the Council to declare that
decisions between member states would be taken in a spirit of
cooperation.
     A Commission spokesperson said that inclusion of the treaty
reference would act as a constraint on authorities' scope for
imposing bans by underlining that their import policy had to
observe the treaty's golden rule of nondiscrimination between EC
members.
     Another official told EWWE the phrasing meant that member
states would have to be able to justify import restrictions on the
grounds that the waste shipments posed a particular environmental
threat to them or could be treated nearer to their source.  The
text would lead to waste policy being conducted on a regional
basis since it would be virtually impossible to justify blanket
bans on imports at the national level, he said.
     In practice, the question of whether measures taken are "in
accordance with the treaty" is certain to give rise to differing
interpretations and lead to legal disputes, officials believe.
These would be for member states and industry to sort out, since
ministers refused to grant the Commission power to vet measures
before they take effect.
     Van Miert's decision to temporarily ditch the Commission's
traditional line on waste marks his first significant policy
decision since taking over as the EC's environment chief in July
 -- a job many believe he will retain when the 17-strong executive
is reshuffled at the start of next year.  But by going along with
the Council's thinking and pledging not to attack it in court,
Commission and industry officials say the studious Belgian clearly
exceeded the mandate his peers in the EC executive had given him.
     This mandate envisaged that Van Miert should reserve the
right for the Commission to take legal action, as it has done in
the past whenever the Council has approved waste legislation on
the basis of environmental provisions instead of single market
rules.  The Commission's position was bolstered in July when the
European Court of Justice, the bloc's supreme court, upheld the
view that all waste, even nonrecoverable garbage, is a tradeable
good.  As EWWE went to press it was uncertain whether Van Miert's
Commission colleagues would accept his decision or order him to
backtrack.
     Commission officials said he could have to eat his words
anyway if the Court of Justice again supports the Commission's
dogma in two cases against the Council that are currently before
it.  Underscoring his claim that the Commission's fundamental
approach to waste policy had not changed, Van Miert said the
executive would not withdraw the cases.  France's Royal told
reporters it was now time for the Court to fall in with the
Council's view that waste could not be considered a marketable
commodity like any other.
     Though waste experts at the Commission consider the French
ban on imports of household waste to be illegal, they do not
expect the EC executive, feeling frail as a number of governments
try to cut back its powers, to take any action against Paris for
the time being.
     Ministers hope to formally adopt the regulation at their next
meeting on 15-16 December if the European Parliament, which has to
be consulted about the change in the legal base of the measure,
can deliver its advisory opinion by then.  The regulation would
take effect 15 months after it is passed, although Germany may
call for more time to change the rules in its devolved system.
Governments have yet to agree on how soon the Community should
ratify the Basel Convention.
     Waste industry officials predicted that extra administrative
burdens resulting from the tighter controls on waste trade
foreseen under the regulation could prove too burdensome for
smaller companies and force them to sell out to powerful
multinational waste groups.  "I see Waste Management Inc. and
Browning-Ferris picking up market share," said Vogt of the
European Federation of Waste Management.

Tracking the Waste

     The regulation lays down elaborate notification and
information procedures for virtually all waste movements, which
give authorities a month or more to decide whether to approve or
refuse a shipment.  Ministers agreed at the last minute to require
that movements within the Community of waste for recovery included
on the OECD's so-called "green" (nonhazardous) list must be
accompanied by a tracking document giving details of where it is
destined and when.
     Belgium insisted that transporters should carry such
information with them to facilitate spot checks aimed at ensuring
that such waste is actually recovered.  Investigations in the
Flanders region had shown that 30%-40% of all green waste sent for
recovery never arrived at its destination, raising suspicions that
it was simply being dumped, Belgian officials said.
     Under the regulation, exports of green list waste for
recovery would be subject to no special controls unless an
importing country required them.  But ministers, largely at the
instigation of The Netherlands, agreed that the Community should
be able to impose controls on such waste if it proves to have
hazardous traits.  Greenpeace argues that although the list
primarily groups inoffensive materials like glass and paper, the
US has succeeded in persuading its OECD partners to include heavy
metals that could prove harmful in certain circumstances.

OECD Report on Packaging Waste Favors Industry Solutions

     A report on Reduction and Recycling of Packaging Waste,
released this month by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) and written by James McCarthy of the US
Congressional Research Service, cites different definitions and
different ways of compiling data on waste and recycling as a
barrier to effective waste reduction and management.  The OECD
expects the report to provide a common basis for regulators to
develop and refine national programs to reduce packaging waste.
The report carefully avoids direct criticism of individual OECD
member countries, but seems to favor waste reduction programs that
place the financial and logistical burden of reducing packaging
waste on industry rather than on local governments.
     "There is no standard definition of recycling in use in most
OECD countries and certainly no definition accepted by the OECD as
a whole," the report says.  "With many countries setting goals for
recycling ... and many wishing to make intercountry comparisons,
improved data are now particularly important."  Recycling
statistics vary widely by country; some include industrial waste,
postconsumer waste, or contaminants, while others exclude them.
Countries also use different methods to account for imported and
exported waste.
     The key issues mentioned in the report are:

     * Application of the "polluter pays" principle.  Comparing
the US, New Zealand, and Japan (where "it appears that ... the
government will pay the additional costs of recycling through
local governments") with Europe (where "regulators favor placing
the financial and logistical burden of reducing waste on
industry"), the report concludes that "there are clear advantages
to holding industry responsible" for packaging waste management.
If industry collects the materials, the report notes, there is an
incentive to reduce waste generation through lighter materials or
reusable packaging.  Governments are likely to be less responsive
than industry to market signals and may also run out of funding to
sustain effective recycling programs.
     * Primary opportunities.  Improved recapture rates can be
achieved with all materials, according to the report, but
corrugated containers and glass offer the best opportunities
because they do not pose major logistical problems and they make
up a large amount of packaging waste.
     * Packaging restrictions.  The report points out that banning
specific packaging materials or using economic instruments to
curtail their use might be a controversial option.  "In free
market economies, consumer choice is a fundamental value.
Limitations of consumer choice are not taken lightly....
Questions arise as to the extent to which other considerations
(such as the protection of markets) have masqueraded as a concern
for protection of the environment," the report says.

     The OECD is currently working on a report on packaging and
financial instruments, OECD sources say.  That report could be
finished and approved internally by the end of this year.  One
OECD source, however, termed the subject matter "very sensitive"
(since the report will deal with taxation and other financial
incentives and disincentives to waste reduction) and cautioned
that it might take longer.

Eco-Emballage Gains Approval to Handle Waste Recovery

     Eco-Emballage, the system set up by the French private sector
to ensure compliance with France's new packaging decree, has now
obtained the official approval of French Environment Minister
Segolene Royal to contract to consumer goods producers and
importers.  To complete the approval process, it still needs the
go-ahead from the Finance, Agriculture, and Industry Ministries,
and the Secretary for Local Communities.
     The so-called "Lalonde Decree" -- named for former
Environment Minister Brice Lalonde and set to take effect in
January 1993 -- gives companies a choice between setting up their
own retrieval and reduction schemes for packaging waste or joining
a system such as Eco-Emballage.
     Because of the financial and logistical problems associated
with managing a nationwide collection, sorting, and recycling and
energy recovery program, many companies are expected to opt for
participation in Eco-Emballage.  Wine and spirits producers,
however, consider Eco-Emballage's participation fee too expensive
and have decided to establish their own system, Adelphe, to handle
bottle glass recovery and recycling.  Adelphe has independently
applied for government approval and will have "a separate
agreement" with Eco-Emballage to use some, but not all, of the
other system's services, according to Eco-Emballage spokesperson
Nathalie Laine.  Eco-Emballage expects to charge 1 centime (0.2
cents) per bottle during its first year of operation, and to
increase the fee during the following years.
     Eco-Emballage came into existence in August and now groups 17
companies, including Procter & Gamble France, Nestle France, and
Coca Cola Beverages S.A.  In return for its participation fee,
which is based on a company's annual packaging production, the
system guarantees to develop sorting facilities and find recycling
or energy recovery outlets for the packaging waste it handles.
     Eco-Emballage resembles the German packaging waste recovery
system, Duales System Deutschland, but there are some key
differences.  The French system relies on existing local
government collection authorities to collect and separate waste.
It does not currently expect to install packaging return bins at
the point of sale, as the German packaging law requires.  And
unlike the Duales System, Eco-Emballage will be able to incinerate
plastic waste for energy production.  The German system has had
problems trying to find uses for the plastic waste it collects.
     In September, Eco-Emballage signed an agreement with the
Duales System to use the German system's "Green Dot" symbol to
mark the product packaging of participating companies.  This
agreement will allow companies selling into both the French and
German markets to adhere to the collection and recycling
requirements of both countries by participating in one of the
systems.  The two will jointly use the "Green Dot" to avoid
confusion.  Laine says that Eco-Emballage expects similar systems
in other neighboring countries to eventually use the same symbol.
     Though the French decree does not set specific quantitative
targets, they are likely to follow once the proposed EC directive
on packaging waste is approved.  Quantitative targets will then
"fill out the rest of the framework" provided by the EC, says
Claude Reny, a French packaging industry expert.  For the time
being, "no one expects an effective system to come right away,"
says Claude Perrin at the French National Federation of Waste and
the Environment, adding that full implementation "is likely to
take several years."  Eco-Emballage's general target is to recover
75% of all packaging.  It plans to recycle three quarters of that
amount and incinerate the rest.
     With regard to the EC packaging proposal, which the European
Commission issued in July, Great Britain, which is president of
the EC's Council of Ministers until the end of this year, wants
the 12 environment ministers to hold a first debate on it at their
next scheduled meeting on 15-16 December in Brussels.  In the
meantime, it aims to get negotiations on the proposed directive
started between officials from the member states.

Dutch Eco-Label Misses Deadline

     The national environmental label that the Dutch Environment
Ministry hoped to introduce next month will be several months late
in coming.  Although the independent foundation charged with
preparing it is busy defining criteria for six product groups, the
criteria will not be ready until the end of this year, and
eco-labeled consumer goods will be available in stores by spring
1993 at the earliest.
     Development and administration of the eco-label, initiated
this summer by the Dutch Environment Ministry and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, is in the hands of Stichting Milieukeur, a
foundation in which producers, retailers, consumers, and
environmental groups as well as the government are represented.
The foundation owns the label, defines the criteria used in
awarding it, and controls its use.  In considering a product
group, Stichting Milieukeur takes into account all phases of a
product's life cycle, from production to the waste stage.  Food
and pharmaceutical products are excluded from the eco-label
system, because in these categories rules for product information
already exist.
     Establishing the criteria for the first six product groups is
taking more time than expected, says H.G.M. Giezeman, general
manager of the foundation.  Stichting Milieukeur is currently
working on criteria for cat litter, shower heads, paints, gypsum
board, light sources, and paper.  According to Giezeman, "we'll be
happy if we set criteria for two or three of these product groups
by the end of the year.  Our plan is now to have the first
products with an eco-label in the stores sometime in the spring of
1993."
     Producers and consumers alike can make a request to set
standards for a certain product group, and the foundation has
already received a few requests to include additional groups.
After the criteria have been defined and published, a producer or
importer can present a product for examination.  The tests are
carried out by recognized certifying institutions, not by the
foundation itself.  If the applicant is awarded the label, he has
to pay Stichting Milieukeur a turnover-based amount for the use of
it.  The label is then valid for two to five years, depending on
the product group.
     The Dutch label will show a hand holding a stamp that prints
"Milieukeur," or "Eco-label."
     The EC has also approved an eco-label scheme, but "the
Environment Ministry and the Ministry for Economic Affairs opted
for a Dutch eco-label in addition to the planned EC label for two
reasons," says Giezeman.  "First, because the EC label is a long
time coming, and second, because it is quite possible that the
European standards will be less severe.  Of course we aim at one
label, but with 12 parties involved, [less stringent] compromises
seem likely."

No Green Christmas as EC Eco-Label Also Falls Behind Schedule

     Manufacturers hoping to win the EC's new environmental label
for their "green" products will have to wait until the start of
next year at the earliest.  Governments had hoped to get the first
goods bearing the long-awaited eco-label into stores this fall,
but the plans have fallen several months behind schedule,
officials from the EC and interest groups told EWWE.  "The truth
is that no products with an eco-label can appear in the shops in
1992," said one.
     Getting experts to agree on the cradle-to-grave criteria that
products should meet is proving slow going: to date they have
proposed standards only for washing machines and dishwashers.  But
the scheme has also been held up by teething troubles in the
creation of a 12-strong "consultative forum" of nongovernmental
interest groups that has to give its (purely advisory) opinion
before environmental standards for each group of products can be
fixed.
     Industry, the retail trade, consumer organizations, and
environmental groups have three seats each on the forum.  Trade
unions are angry that industry and retailers have refused to
include labor representatives in their delegations, while
environmental groups have withheld their nominations to the forum
until they receive financial assistance for participating.
Officials from the European Trade Union Confederation and the
European Environmental Bureau, an umbrella grouping of some 140
environment nongovernmental organizations across the EC, told EWWE
that both issues seemed likely to be resolved fairly soon with
help from the European Commission, probably enabling the forum to
start work by the end of November.
     Theoretically the forum could have been launched without the
environmentalists -- the other three groups have already nominated
their members -- but in practice this could have undermined the
eco-label's credibility.  Such credibility is widely seen as
crucial to the success of the scheme as it seeks to bring order to
a rash of claims to "environmental friendliness" by manufacturers
and to help the growing numbers of concerned consumers choose
goods that are genuinely "greener."  Some officials hope that in
the long term it will supplant the national schemes operated by
Germany and getting under way in France and The Netherlands,
leaving Europe with a single eco-label.
     If getting the first eco-labeled goods into the shops by
Christmas seems out of reach, there are hopes that at least the
criteria for the initial product groups can be agreed by then.
Proposed standards for washing machines and dishwashers were
submitted by a British-led working group of EC experts in August.
Once the consultative forum delivers its opinion on the proposal,
the way will be clear for the Commission, aided by a committee of
EC government officials, to fix the standards.  Assuming the forum
starts work soon, "I still see some prospect that the first
criteria can be adopted by the end of the year," one EC official
told EWWE.  "At the moment we're still building the slipway to
launch the ship, but once the year turns we're likely to see
things rolling forward quite quickly."
     That should mean producers and importers of washing machines
and dishwashers will be able to apply for an eco-label early in
1993.  Under the decentralized awards procedure decided by
governments, producers or importers need apply in only one EC
member state for a label valid across the whole Community of 340
million people.  Specially designated agencies in each of the 12
countries -- due to be set up by early November -- will be
responsible for awarding or refusing the label on the basis of the
standards set at EC level.
     After washing machines, paper is likely to be next in line to
get the eco-label logo, a flower made up of 12 stars enclosing a
lop-sided "E."  EC officials said a Danish-led group of experts is
close to proposing criteria for various paper products.  After
that may come detergents, although controversy has erupted over
the criteria: self-styled "environmental detergent makers" have
criticized draft standards produced by a German-led expert group
as far too lax and have set up their own trade association to
ensure they get a say in the rest of the drafting process.
Criteria for other goods are further off.  French-led work on
standards for paints and varnishes is months overdue and an
Italian-chaired group is still debating norms for packaging
materials.  Hairsprays, light bulbs, soil enrichers, and textiles
are further back still in the pipeline.

BAT Definition Changes as EC Permitting Draft Nears Completion

     Answering a key demand of industry, the European Commission
intends to remold its definition of "best" available techniques
(BAT) for limiting pollution from industrial plants to take
account of the techniques' economic viability and environmental
benefits.  The new definition will be written into the next -- and
possibly final -- draft of the European Commission's ambitious
upcoming directive on integrated pollution prevention and control
(IPPC), a well-placed source in the EC executive told EWWE.  The
17 Commissioners could formalize the proposal in the next few
weeks although it seems more likely that they will hold it over
until early next year (see "Denmark Set to Push Carbon Tax" on
page 13).  Once adopted by the Commission, the text will require
the unanimous approval of the Council of EC environment ministers
to get onto the Community's statute book, a process that seldom
takes less than a year.
     The EC's industrial lobby has been irked that the approach to
BAT taken by the Commission's directorate-general for environment
so far has not been based on cost/benefit analysis.  (This is a
complaint leveled at the department's work across the board by an
increasing number inside as well as outside the Commission.)  The
change now envisaged means that the Commission's definition of BAT
will be akin to what British requirements term BATNEEC ("Best
Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Costs").  "Just
because the latest technology can reduce emissions by 1% doesn't
mean you will have to use it if it costs three times as much,"
explained the Commission source.  Though the concept of BAT will
still be multifaceted and open to differing interpretations, the
explicit inclusion of costs and benefits as factors to be taken
into account will make it easier for industry to resist being
forced into making frequent and expensive plant upgrades as
BAT-driven standards are ratcheted up.
     The IPPC directive would require new and existing plants in a
wide range of industries, from energy production to large-scale
animal rearing, to obtain an operating permit from the relevant
national or local authorities.  It sets a framework of permit
rules under which emissions to air, water, and soil would be
considered in an "integrated" way, the aim being to prevent or
minimize emissions and the creation of waste in all areas
simultaneously instead of shifting pollution from one medium to
another.  BAT plays a central role in these rules.  The text
stipulates that BAT must be used to limit emissions of a broad
span of substances listed in a technical annex, particularly those
that are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, toxic, persistent,
or bioaccumulative, or that have a "bearing on global pollution
problems."  BAT would also have to be employed to recover and
recycle waste where such operations made economic and
environmental sense.

Flexibility for Existing Installations

     The permit would have to ensure that environmental quality
objectives -- whether set at EC level or locally -- were met.
Moreover, for each plant the competent authority would be required
to fix limit values for emissions of substances listed in the
technical annex.  The limits would have to be based on BAT and to
be at least as strict as those fixed by the Community (where
common EC standards exist).  There would be a degree of
flexibility for existing installations, however: where they could
meet the relevant environmental quality objectives without using
BAT, their emissions limit could be up to twice as high (though
not for the more harmful substances, and only if the less
stringent standards did not pose an unacceptable risk to
ecosystems or human health).
     Any plan to increase emissions would require approval from
the permit authority.  Furthermore, the authority would have the
right to reconsider a permit at any time in the light of
developments in BAT.  For plants where the relevant equipment has
been depreciated by 90% or more, the authority would be obliged to
toughen up the permitted emission limit values into line with
those attainable by BAT at that time.  Operators unwilling or
unable to upgrade an installation to meet revised standards would
have to close it within two years.
     Under the proposed timetable -- which, if past experience is
any indication, is quite likely to be stretched by ministers, at
least for some EC members -- the directive would enter force on 1
July 1995.  New plants could not start operations after that date
without a permit.  Existing installations would have until 1 July
1999 to apply for a permit and until 1 July 2005 to comply with
its requirements.  In practice this means that many plants
operating today may not be affected by the rules.
     Because BAT is about techniques, not technology, Commission
officials say increasingly stringent BAT-led limit values could be
met in many cases through improved operating practices without
having to make costly new investments.  "The idea is not that
(operators) would have to put in new equipment every five years,
although that's not entirely impossible," said one.

Industry Seeks to Freeze Permit Conditions

     Industry is wary of such assurances, however, and wants
permits to be valid for a clearly defined period.  The Union of
Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe (UNICE),
European industry's lobby group, proposes that permit conditions
should not be changed for 10 years "unless to do so would result
in a necessary improvement for the environment as a whole at an
acceptable cost for an average operator in the relevant industrial
sector."  It also rejects the yardstick of a 90% depreciation of
equipment, which in some countries could be achieved within as
little as five years, Commission officials said.
     The framework directive creates potential for an avalanche of
follow-up legislation by stipulating that the EC executive may
propose Community-wide limit values based on BAT.  These would
require approval by only a two-thirds majority in the Council of
Ministers.  The Commission source said, however, that his
institution was likely to hold off on proposing common norms
unless differences in BAT-based standards from country to country
led to distortions in fair competition within EC industry.
     Here, in brief, are other key details of the draft directive:

     * Permit applications must detail measures proposed for
preventing or minimizing emissions and waste, as well as solutions
that were rejected after consideration.
     * Permits should normally be issued within six months of an
application, though the deadline can be waived in certain
circumstances.
     * The public must be given the right to comment on
applications for permits before the competent authority makes a
decision.  The results of monitoring of plants' compliance with
permit requirements must also be available to the public.
     * The Commission will organize information exchanges between
national competent authorities on developments in BAT and
monitoring.
     * A committee of member state representatives chaired by the
Commission would have the power to revise EC emission limit values
in the light of BAT developments.

     Sectors covered by the permit requirement would be energy;
metals production and processing; manufacture of nonmetallic
mineral products; chemicals; waste management; pulp and paper;
dyeing; treatment or finishing of fibers or textiles; production
of dyestuffs, pigments, paints, inks and enamels; production and
tanning of leather; electrolytic or mechanical plating of metals;
printing; application of paints and varnishes; food canning and
processing; treatment or processing of animal waste; and intensive
animal rearing.  In some sectors the requirement would apply only
to installations above a certain size or annual throughput.

EC Finalizes US-Style Energy Labeling Scheme for Consumers

     Manufacturers and importers of a range of household
appliances sold in the EC will be required to supply prospective
customers with information on their energy consumption from the
beginning of 1994 at the latest.  Under the terms of a directive1
recently finalized by the Council of Ministers, the EC's
legislative body, appliances will have to be labeled for their
energy efficiency and product brochures must include energy
information.
     The scheme is the latest example of the Community's efforts
to harness market forces in the cause of environmental protection.
It aims to resuscitate a moribund energy labeling initiative that
dates from 1979 and was only ever applied to electric ovens.  As
governments look for new ways to limit carbon dioxide emissions
from power generation, the directive also seeks to prevent a
proliferation of different national energy labeling schemes that
would create new barriers to internal trade just as the EC and its
EFTA neighbors prepare to launch the giant European market on 1
January 1993.
     Initially, energy efficiency labels and information will be
required for seven categories of appliances:

     * Refrigerators and freezers;
     * Washing machines and driers;
     * Dishwashers;
     * Ovens;
     * Water heaters and hot-water storage appliances;
     * Lighting sources; and
     * Air conditioners.

     The text says, however, that other types of appliances could
be added to the list later, though only those that use significant
amounts of energy and afford adequate scope for improved
efficiency would be targeted.  The directive will apply whether
appliances covered are for use in the home or in nonhousehold
locations such as restaurants and hotels.
     The energy information must not only be displayed in shops,
but it must also be provided in mail order catalogues and to
customers who hire an appliance or buy one on hire-purchase terms.
Details of information and labels and measuring methods will be
specified in "daughter" directives for each type of appliance to
be issued before the scheme begins.

Rue de la Loi, 1041 Brussels, Belgium.  Tel: +32 2 234 6111.

New Report Forecasts Lower CO2 Emissions for Great Britain

     In the same week that British Rail announced a substantial
increase in long-distance rail fares, the British government
published figures suggesting road transport will overtake industry
as the principal source of rising emissions by the year 2000.
     In its Energy Paper 59, the British government details its
latest range of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions forecasts and
explains the methodology and models used to arrive at these
figures for the first time.
     The new figures update those given in Energy Paper 58,
published in 1990, and suggest Great Britain will emit around 10%
less CO2 than was feared in the earlier forecasts.  However, they
also indicate existing policies will do far less than the
recession or the closure of the coal industry to combat global
warming.
     On the basis of the figures given in Energy Paper 59, Great
Britain could readily bring its CO2 emissions back to 1990 levels
by the year 2000.  The forecast of Energy Paper 58 for the year
2000 was 174 to 206 million tons of carbon in emissions; Energy
Paper 59 only speaks of 157 to 179 million tons, compared with 160
million tons actually emitted in 1990.  The report suggests that
the earlier estimates have allowed the British government to set
itself achievable -- if not lenient -- emissions reduction
targets.  Achieving them is now made even easier by a recession
and a rapid switch away from coal-fired electricity generation to
power from natural gas.
     The difference between the long-term forecasts is somewhat
smaller; Energy Paper 58 speaks of 188 to 316 million tons, and
Energy Paper 59 stays approximately within that range, with a
forecast of 188 to 285 million tons.  These forecasts reinforce
the arguments that overall emissions will continue to rise if
energy prices continue to fall, and that the proposed EC carbon
tax is unlikely to affect the two most important future sources of
CO2 emissions: transport and domestic households.
     While the British government recently launched a public
campaign aimed at householders to encourage energy saving in the
home, its road policies are the subject of vocal criticism from
environmental pressure groups.
     At the recent review of the 1990 government "white paper" on
the environment, "This Common Inheritance," British Environment
Minister Michael Howard said he would be "looking at road pricing"
to limit environmental damage, but could not promise any firm
proposals in this direction before the end of 1994.
     Greenpeace UK says the British government "has no policy to
tackle the rising environmental cost of road transport....  With
the price of oil around US $20 per barrel, the economic cost of
motoring in the UK is now cheaper than at any time since before
the oil crisis.  But the EC carbon tax won't translate into a
significant price rise at the petrol pump."

EC to Push for Methyl Bromide Controls, May Further Accelerate CFC
Phaseout

     The EC is to join the campaign by industrialized countries,
aimed toward next month's conference of parties to the Montreal
Protocol, to impose controls on production and use of methyl
bromide, a gas widely used for fumigating soil and crops.  The
decision reflects mounting scientific evidence that the chemical
is a hugely powerful destroyer of atmospheric ozone.
     Greece had resisted the move but backed down and fell into
line with the rest of the Community at a meeting of the EC's
Council of environment ministers in Luxembourg on 20 October.  The
ministers agreed that the Community should press other parties to
the protocol to bring methyl bromide into the list of controlled
substances at the Copenhagen conference.  The EC will push for
production and use of the pesticide to be frozen at 1991 levels by
1995, and for more far-reaching limits to be set next year.
     Molecule-for-molecule, methyl bromide is estimated to be
between 30 and 120 times more destructive to ozone than chlorine.
A scientific panel set up by the UN Environment Program has found
that cutting atmospheric methyl bromide concentrations by 10%
would be as beneficial to the ozone layer as speeding up the
phaseout of CFCs by three years.  But many developing countries
are resisting the idea of limiting use of the chemical, arguing
that alternatives for crop fumigation are costlier and less
effective.
     Differences between the 12 EC members meant ministers had to
leave open the question of whether the Community should push at
Copenhagen for an even quicker phaseout of other ozone eaters by
the industrialized world than it has envisaged hitherto.  Last
March the EC agreed to urge a 1 January 1996 deadline for a total
halt to production and use of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride,
and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform) except for essential
uses for which no viable substitutes existed.  Now Germany,
Denmark, and The Netherlands, with some support from Belgium,
Britain, and the European Commission, want faster action.
     Ministers decided to come back to the question at a
coordination meeting just before the Copenhagen conference opens
on 18 November.  British Environment Secretary Michael Howard, who
chaired the Council meeting, said governments had agreed that the
March position "is not the last word."  EC Environment
Commissioner Karel Van Miert told reporters the situation was
still evolving and the Community could even agree on a more
ambitious position on methyl bromide before the conference begins.
     After Copenhagen, the Council aims to decide at its next
meeting on 15-16 December whether the EC should go faster in
phasing out listed substances internally than whatever new
timetable emerges from the Montreal Protocol conference.  For more

Service, 170 rue de la Loi, 1040 Brussels, Belgium.  Tel: +32 2

German Regulations Will Limit Gas Station Emissions Starting 1
January

     Two regulations seeking to limit hydrocarbon emissions at gas
stations in Germany will come into force on 1 January 1993.  One
mandates the introduction of the so-called "balancing" system,
which cuts down on emissions from the filling of gas station
storage tanks.1  In this system, a hose runs between the gasoline
truck and the tank.  Gasoline flows into the tank, while vapors
from the tank that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere are
pumped back into the truck, then taken back to the refinery to be
reprocessed.  This system is already widespread, and Josef Lerach,
an expert at the German Environment Ministry, expects it to be
"fully functional" within five years.  For new gas stations,
compliance with the regulation has been mandatory since 14 October
1992, while others have a grace period.
     The second regulation2 provides for gas stations to install
double-barreled hoses on their pumps to limit emissions from
pumping gasoline to cars.  Gasoline flows out, while vapors are
recovered.  The regulation does not specify the technical details,
leaving room for development.  It seems fairly certain, however,
that German gas stations will not adopt the US-type vapor recovery
system, which petroleum industry representatives have described as
"unwieldy" (and which would also not work well in Europe because
its effectiveness depends on a degree of filler neck
standardization that does not yet exist there).
     New gas stations will have to comply with the regulation as
of January, which makes it particularly important for the former
East German states, where many new stations are opening up.
Existing fuel stations will benefit from grace periods in inverse
proportion to their size to allow time for retrofitting. Large
stations, selling more than five million liters per year, have
three years to comply, medium-sized ones four years and small ones
five years. Existing stations selling less than one million liters
a year are exempted altogether.  Annual checkups are mandatory;
every five years, an independent expert must inspect the system.
     At the EC level, an initiative to combat hydrocarbon
emissions is taking shape at the European Commission in Brussels.
The proposal, which could be ready by the end of this year or
early 1993, would generalize the requirements that Germany and
also The Netherlands (where regulations requiring the installation
of vapor recovery systems were recently introduced) are already
putting into law.
     The plan, which like all legislative proposals would require
approval by the EC's Council of Ministers before it could enter
the statute book, marks the second stage in a Commission drive to
reduce hydrocarbon emissions from the fuel distribution chain.
The EC executive launched the first stage in August by proposing a
directive3 that seeks to cut emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) from storage facilities and distribution tankers
by 90% over 10 years through use of vapor recovery systems and
other measures.
     Behind the strategy lie the twin goals of cutting pollution
by low-level ozone and reducing people's exposure to potentially
harmful localized vapors of benzene and other hydrocarbons.
Hydrocarbons are one of the main precursors of ozone, creating the
irritant gas when they react in sunlight with nitrous oxides from
vehicle exhausts.
     To the chagrin of the oil industry, Brussels has followed the
US's lead in deciding against requiring large carbon canisters to
be fitted on cars.  Vapor recovery systems will be pump-based
instead.  The Commission's current thinking is to make fuel
throughput, rather than location, the key criterion: large service
stations would be the primary targets for installing vapor
recovery equipment.
     A minimum of technical harmonization would also be needed to
lay down essential specifications for pump and car equipment and
vapor recovery efficiencies.  Whether location will also become a
criterion remains to be seen.  An earlier suggestion that stations
in towns of fewer than 50,000 inhabitants should be exempted seems
to have faded.  Germany, with its approach based on the throughput
of fuel stations, opposes such exemptions on the grounds that
emissions pose a health risk wherever they occur, Lerach told
EWWE.  In Germany, the location of the gas station plays a role
only in that stations in more polluted areas (as defined by the
Lander, or federal states) have one year less to comply.

Study Finds Biofuel Drawbacks Outweigh Advantages

     A study commissioned by the German Federal Environment Office
(Umweltbundesamt), and due to be released soon, comes to the
conclusion that the environmental drawbacks of substituting
rapeseed oil for diesel fuel outweigh the advantages, and that
money subsidizing rapeseed production could probably be used to
more advantage elsewhere.
     The study tries to take a comprehensive look at the different
ways in which the use of rapeseed oil would affect the
environment.  It takes into account emissions of various
greenhouse gases -- in particular methane and nitrous oxide (N2O),
fertilizer use and runoff in rapeseed production, and the extent
to which rapeseed production (and the subsidies farmers can obtain
for it) interferes with a government program to let fields lie
fallow for a certain period to improve the soil.
     Its overall conclusion is that while shifting to rapeseed oil
does have environmental benefits, they are too small to warrant
such a shift.  Subsidies for rapeseed production, says Jurgen
Landgrebe, the author of the study, could be put to more effective
use elsewhere, for example in research on fuel-efficient
automobiles.  This conclusion is not likely to please the
agricultural lobby, which considers rapeseed production one way of
helping West European farmers at a time when they see agricultural
subsidies in general to be in danger.
     Experts at research institutes and in the German Environment
Ministry are currently commenting on the study, and challenging
some of the assumptions it is based on.  One main concern is that
the N2O level that the study's conclusions are based on may be too
high.  Reliable data on man-made N2O are relatively hard to come
by, compared with other greenhouse gases.
     A second study, by Guido Reinhardt of the Institute for
Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU-Institute) in Heidelberg,
Germany, focuses specifically on energy and carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions.  Reinhardt, whose study is being published separately,
compared the overall amount of energy needed to produce enough
rapeseed oil or diesel to fuel a car for a given distance.  His
conclusion is that, in terms of energy and CO2 emissions alone,
the use of rapeseed oil offers significant environmental benefits,
but that, if one wants to take all factors into account, more work
needs to be done.

In Britain, Better Pay for Better Water

     Severn Trent Water Ltd., a British utility company, has made
a deal with its employees that may give them a good reason to
comply with EC directives on water quality -- a persistent problem
for Great Britain -- and cut down on customer complaints.  Two
years of negotiations between the company and the local unions led
to an agreement -- the first of its kind in the British water
industry -- under which workers could see pay rises of up to 23%
by 1994, provided that the quality of Severn Trent's water
improves.
     The basic annual pay increase for Severn Trent's maintenance
staff is 4%.  On top of that, workers have been promised "quality
performance" bonuses of 5% in 1993 and 10% in 1994.  The bonuses
are contingent upon the company's achieving its targets for water
and sewage treatment and customer services.
     Severn Trent will not, however, tie the payments to the
results of water quality tests.  Instead, workers will receive the
bonus when the number of customer complaints comes down.
According to a Severn Trent spokesperson, "We want the water
people drink to be of the best quality.  The only way we know we
are achieving this is if we see the number of complaints at a
minimum."
     Severn Trent employs 10,000 people and supplies water and
treats sewage for over 8 million customers in the British
Midlands.

Denmark Set to Push Carbon Tax, Ignore Packaging Directive in EC
Presidency

     According to a preliminary list of priorities drawn up by the
Danish Environment Ministry, Denmark intends to push for agreement
on an EC-wide carbon/energy tax but to cold-shoulder proposals for
common rules on packaging during its term as president of the
Community's legislative body, the Council of Ministers, in the
first half of next year.
     Copenhagen is hoping EC environment ministers will approve
the highly controversial carbon/energy tax proposal1 during its
six-month presidency, a goal many will find ambitious given the
technical complexity of the tax and the political raw nerves it
touches in several countries.  Denmark is eager for the Community
to bring in the tax to help meet its CO2 stabilization goal,
without waiting for the US, Japan, and other Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members to take
similar measures, as the European Commission has proposed.
     Conspicuously absent from the environment ministry's list of
eight priorities is the long-awaited directive on packaging2
proposed by the Commission in July.  Denmark is among the member
states that have criticized the draft proposal, which in its
current form would force Copenhagen to scrap its long-standing ban
on the sale of beverages in cans.
     Denmark is, however, hoping the Council will reach agreement
on introducing a voluntary eco-auditing scheme for industry3 (see
News Briefs, page 16) and to approve tighter regulations on trade
in endangered species.4
     The other issues Denmark plans to work on are:

     * A yet to be published proposal establishing a common regime
for integrated pollution prevention and control (see "BAT
Definition Changes As EC Permitting Draft Nears Completion" on
page 7);
     * A directive seeking to reduce volatile organic compound
(VOC) emissions from fuel storage and distribution by 90% over 10
years5;
     * A directive toughening up emissions standards for
incineration of hazardous waste6;
     * The European Commission's fifth EC environmental action
program,7 and the possible development of further initiatives to
carry out the program; and
     * The discussion and possible establishment of procedures to
integrate the concept of sustainable development into all sectors
of policy.

     The ministry stresses that the list is tentative and may be
changed, possibly in order to accommodate any issues left
unresolved by Great Britain, the Council president until the end
of this year.  However, the ministry considers eight issues the
maximum number it can properly deal with over six months.

Europarliament Committee Wants Pollution Phase-Out Calendar

     An influential committee of EC parliamentarians is calling
for the bloc to draw up a timetable for completely phasing out
emissions of pesticides, phosphates, nitrates, and other
pollutants.  The demand forms part of a resolution the European
Parliament's environment committee has drafted in response to the
fifth EC environmental action program proposed by the European
Commission, the Community's executive.  The program, the main
vehicle through which the EC intends to translate the Rio Earth
Summit agreements into practice, will run from next year until
2000, and seeks to make a start on shifting the Community economy
toward environmental sustainability.
     The full 518-member Euroassembly is expected to vote next
month on the resolution, which the Commission is not obliged to
heed.  Spanish Socialist member Carmen Diez de Rivera, who drafted
the resolution, told EWWE the zero emissions calendar was one of
many long-standing demands of the parliament that had so far been
ignored.  Other suggestions in the paper include an EC-wide
referendum on nuclear power, creation of a Community inspectorate
to make sure environment rules are heeded, a standard tourist tax
to fund environmental maintenance of resorts, and payment of part
of the revenues from the proposed EC carbon/energy tax into a fund
to help developing countries and East European states reduce their
carbon dioxide emissions.
     The Community's Council of environment ministers is waiting
for the parliament to approve the resolution before finalizing its
own reaction to the program in December, the last procedural
hurdle to cross before the Commission can start implementing the
plan.  The program forms a comprehensive strategy of measures to
achieve defined environmental quality targets through cooperation
among all levels of society.

British Look at the Big Environmental Picture

     The British government has for the first time published a
comprehensive collection of environmental statistics.  UK
Environment covers a broad range of topics including climate, air
quality, waste, soil and land use, water quality, the marine
environment, coastal erosion, wildlife habitats, and populations.
     Not much of the information in the compendium is new, but
much of it has not been compiled into one reference source before.
The publication of the report also fulfills a promise made in the
British government's 1990 "white paper" on the environment, This
Common Inheritance, to make information about the environment
available to everyone.  Consequently, much of the information is
presented in the form of charts and maps for the layperson rather
than detailed tables for the expert.
     The report confirms that some environmental standards have
deteriorated.  Since 1980, sulphur dioxide concentrations have
declined, but carbon monoxide emissions have risen by 30% over the
same period due to an increase in road transport.  For the same
reason, nitrogen dioxide emissions have increased by 35% since
1986.  CO2 emissions have remained reasonably static over the past
10 years, but the relative importance of road transport has also
risen substantially for this pollutant.
     According to the report, accurate figures for the amount
spent on protecting the environment do not exist in Great Britain.
Nevertheless, the compendium estimates that some 14 billion pounds
(US $22.4 billion), or about 2.5% of gross domestic product, was
invested in environmental protection during 1991.  [Note: As used
in EWWE, the word billion equals thousand million or
1,000,000,000.]
     According to government estimates, the largest share of this,
6.7 billion pounds (US $10.7 billion), went toward water
purification and river pollution cleanup.  British water suppliers
are currently implementing a program of changes required by EC
directives governing water quality (see "In Britain, Better Pay
for Better Water" on page 13).
     Three billion British pounds (US $4.8 billion) was spent to
reduce pollution arising from all types of waste material.
Industry spent a further 2.4 billion pounds (US $3.8 billion) to
reduce air emissions, and just under 2 billion pounds (US $3.2
billion) went toward land cleanup and noise reduction.
     Overall, around 60% of identifiable expenditure, or 8.8
billion pounds (US $14 billion), was related to pollution
abatement.  Natural resource management took 24% and amenity
improvement 8%.  Less than 10% in total was spent on conservation,
research, development, education, and training.

of the Environment, can be obtained from the British government

Environment Budget Up in Spain, Down in Italy

     The Spanish Ministry for Public Works and Transport (which is
also in charge of environmental affairs) projects a 30% increase
(over 1992) in Spain's environment budget for next year.  For
1993, Vicente Albero, general secretary for water and the
environment, will have a total amount of 160 billion pesetas (US
$1.5 billion) to spend.  Water plays a major role in the
allocation of those funds; substantial amounts will go toward
coastal improvements, the improvement of wastewater systems, and a
new water management and protection plan.
     If approved, this plan would create protected areas for all
rivers, and would also set water prices to reflect the cost of
treating wastewater.  According to a recently released government
report, more than 100 Spanish rivers are -- at least in part --
extremely polluted, groundwater is overexploited, and 40% of all
Spanish reservoirs are entropied.  Under the proposed water price
policy, however, consumers in the driest and least-developed
regions of Spain (which use the largest amounts of water) would
have to pay the most, a fact that has already provoked negative
responses from consumers as well as some parliamentarians.
     At the same time, the Department of Nature Conservation
(Instituto Conservacion de la Naturaleza) within the Ministry of
Agriculture plans to invest more than 5 billion pesetas (US $48
million) in the maintenance of Spain's nine national parks.  The
Ministry of Industry and Tourism, for its part, expects to invest
a total of 48 billion pesetas (US $457 million) in a program that
provides, among other things, for grants to local administrations
and tourist industry companies that want to improve their
environmental performance.  Tourism is a key industry in Spain,
and surveys have shown that environmental quality is important to
visitors from abroad.
     In Italy, meanwhile, the environment budget seems set to go
down by as much as three quarters, as the country is experiencing
major economic and institutional problems.  This, at least, is the
cabinet proposal that the Italian Parliament is currently
discussing.  If the budget is approved in its present form, funds
for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs under
Environment Laws 9 and 10 will be trimmed substantially; funds
earmarked for a CFC phaseout and the stabilization of greenhouse
gases would also suffer.  In the area of public transportation,
the development of high-speed trains, which connect major cities,
would continue to be funded, while funds for local public
transportation are expected to go down.  At the same time, no cuts
have been proposed in the area of road building and road
transport.
     Substantial budget cuts will not help Italy's new environment
minister, Carlo Ripa di Meana, who has to accomplish three major
tasks: reorganize the Ministry of the Environment, badly
understaffed given its tasks and compared with other ministries;
improve Italy's system of enforcement of environmental
regulations;  and fight for funds.  In the latter area, at least,
there may be two partial solutions.  For one thing, Ripa di Meana
has managed to retrieve funds that his predecessor, Giorgio
Ruffolo, did not spend; normally, such funds would go back to the
Treasury.  The 30% left over from last year's budget will now be
available in addition to this year's budget.  Ripa di Meana is
also considering the introduction of "green" taxes and charges
(for example on land use), and the setting of fees for water use
and waste management to reflect their actual cost.  Revenue from
these sources may also help offset budget losses.

Norway Proposes Green Troops for Environmental Cleanup

     The Norwegian government has announced a preliminary plan to
establish an elite force of "green troops" to fight national and
international environmental disasters.  The troops would be drawn
from the regular Norwegian army and would be trained to deal with
oil spills, natural disasters, and nuclear disasters, and to lead
post-war cleanup efforts.
     Gabriel Lund, secretary of the joint defense-environment
ministerial working group that proposed the new program, told
EWWE's sister publication, the Global Environmental Change Report
(GECR), that the government will hold a hearing to discuss the
plan on 16 November 1992 and will publish its decision in
December.  The plan must then be approved by Parliament.
     Lund told GECR that troops would be deployed in two major
units: an emergency unit of 500 to 600 soldiers, prepared to
respond to any disaster within 48 hours, and a follow-up force of
1,100 that would be involved in longer-term cleanup efforts.  Lund
said that international requests for green troop assistance would
be handled through diplomatic channels and cleared with the UN.

Information Office.  Tel: +47 2 402 300 or +47 2 402 310.

NEWS BRIEFS:

     Former EC Commissioner for the Environment Carlo Ripa di
Meana is threatening to set up a European environment agency with
non-EC countries unless the bloc's leaders agree at their December
summit in Edinburgh on where to site the currently homeless EC
Environment Agency.  The colorful Ripa, who now heads Italy's
environment ministry, exploded when his French and Spanish
counterparts blocked attempts to get agreement on a location for
the agency at the EC environment ministers' recent meeting in
Luxembourg.  He also indicated that Italy and France would soon
come forward with new initiatives for reducing carbon dioxide
emissions...  Officials say prospects have improved that EC
environment ministers will agree in December to create a voluntary
scheme to encourage eco-auditing by industry after Germany did not
renew threats to block the initiative...  Belgium's
French-speaking Green party has put forward detailed proposals for
eco-taxes on packaging, throw-away razors, pesticides, and
non-recycled paper, but an agreement in principle, reached on the
issue by the country's major parties this summer, now seems in
doubt...

GREENHOUSE DISPUTE CLOSES THE CURTAIN ON BUSH'S ENVIRONMENTAL
HONEYMOON (NEWS ANALYSIS)

by Dennis Wamsted
The tenuous year-old truce between President Bush and the
environmental community was breached, perhaps irreparably, this
week as long-simmering differences between the two sides on
global warming, the pending reauthorization of the Clean Air Act
and Bush's no-net-loss policy on wetlands all surfaced in heated
public disagreements. The spark for the public split was the
president's speech before the meeting of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) here in Washington.

In his speech, Bush stressed the U.S.' commitment to the IPCC
process and "aggressive and thoughtful action on environmental
issues." As part of this commitment, Bush announced his intention
to host a White House conference on science and economic research
on the environment. In addition, the president reminded the
delegates of the U.S.' budgetary commitment to environmental
protection. The new budget includes more than $2 billion in new
spending for environmental protection, he said, with $1 billion
earmarked specifically for the U.S. Global Change Research
Program.

"That commitment, by far the largest ever made by any nation,
reflects our determination to improve our understanding of the
science of global change," Bush said. "We are working with our
neighbors around the world to enhance global monitoring and data
management, improve analysis, reduce the uncertainty of
predictive models and conduct regular reassessments of the state
of science."

Beyond this global climate change R&D initiative, the
administration has "already taken many steps...that bring both
economic and environmental research. Steps that make sense on
their own merits in terms of responsibility and efficiency, which
help reduce emissions of chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide
and other pollutants now entering the atmosphere."

Still, the president refused to endorse immediate action to
freeze or reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the principal
greenhouse gas, in an effort to slow the projected rise in global
temperatures in the next 50 years or so. "You're called upon to
deliver recommendations which strike a difficult yet critical
international bargain: a convergence between global environmental
policy and global economic policy," Bush told the IPCC delegates.
"Human activities are changing the atmosphere in unexpected and
in unprecedented ways," Bush continued, but many questions remain
unanswered. "Together, we have a responsibility to ourselves and
the generations to come to fulfill our stewardship obligations.
But that responsibility demands that we do it right.

"Some may be tempted to exploit legitimate concerns for political
positioning," Bush added, concluding: "Our responsibility is to
maintain the quality of our approach, our commitment to sound
science and an open mind to policy options."

Bush's refusal to call for immediate action was assailed by the
environmental representatives at the IPCC meeting. The
president's speech "was just a lot of hot air," said Dan Becker,
the director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming & Energy
Program. Bush's promise to plant a billion trees a year in the
U.S. is akin to throwing sponges into Prince William Sound to
clean up the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez tanker. "Sununu
won," Becker added, referring to the intra-administration debate
regarding global warming in which Sununu has taken the go-slow
approach.

The speech had "no new direction, no substantive steps" to attack
the global warming problem, added Brooks Yeager, vice president
of government relations for the National Audubon Society, who
said that the environmental community had hoped Bush would
endorse a CO2 reduction policy. Instead, the administration
continues to oppose even the automotive CO2 emissions standard
included in the Senate's version of the pending Clean Air Act
reauthorization. A national policy on CO2 reductions must be the
first order of business, continued Rafe Pomerance, who is
affiliated with the World Resources Institute.

These concerns were echoed by a number of the environmental
community's strongest supporters in Congress. The president's
speech was disappointing, Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) said. "We
ought to be doing a lot more right now," he said after Bush's
presentation, citing in particular the need for additional
emphasis on energy efficiency measures, alternative fuels and
population control. I am concerned that the administration
appears "unable to move forward."

Later, in a speech on the Senate floor, Wirth urged his
colleagues to act--even if the administration refuses to
cooperate. "It bewilders me why we do not take a leadership role.
It bewilders me why the steps that are so obvious to be taken are
not begin taken."

Wirth's comments were seconded by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.),
who blasted Bush for his inaction. "Having shed his alleged wimp
image in the conduct of foreign affairs, the business of
resurrecting that wimp image in the conduct of our environmental
policy."

Similar concerns were broached this week regarding the
administration's commitment to clean air. "[Bush] has abandoned
his commitment to clean air for all Americans and even threatened
to veto the bipartisan compromise...now pending in the Senate,"
Richard Ayres, the chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition
said in a statement. "The administration is attempting to force a
back-room negotiation aimed at eliminating every single
improvement the Environment Committee made in the administration
bill."

NEW EPA RULE THREATENS VIRGINIA COAL PROJECTS

by Kennedy Maize
A unilateral decision by EPA Region III regarding PSD or
prevention of significant deterioration requirements for new
coal-fired generating facilities, "unless quickly corrected, will
delay and may prevent the development of generating capacity
needed for continued reliable electric service in Virginia,"
Daniel Bird, Virginia's Coal and Energy Commission chairman,
warned in a letter to Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) late last month.

In addition, Bird wrote, the region, which covers Virginia, is
being tougher on pollution control technologies than Region IV,
which covers North Carolina. As a result, "investment in
generating projects and the resulting employment and economic
benefits may shift from Virginia to North Carolina."

According to Bird, prior EPA policy based air modeling for the
PSD program, which governs the construction of new pollution
sources in clean air areas, on the assumption that sources would
emit at their historic rates. But EPA unilaterally decided that
modeling should instead be based on the maximum allowable rate.
"This policy change was made without notice to the public and did
not become apparent until project developers began filing air
permit applications during 1989," wrote Bird. "In March of 1989,
EPA advised the states that modeling on the basis of allowable
emissions would be required by October 1989."

Bird noted that many cases in Virginia show that "a wide gulf
exists between actual and maximum allowable emissions. Therefore,
EPA's shift in policy represented a drastic change that would
become effective while a number of projects that had been planned
and sited under the previous policy were in the process of
development."

Bird said he understands the reason for the EPA shift: The agency
has no assurance that emitters will not increase emissions. But
Bird wants EPA to come up with a transitional approach that does
not harm projects started under the old rules. "I would emphasize
that the commission does not quarrel with EPA's apparent
objective," Bird continued. "However, this rule's unnecessarily
large impacts and the lack of adequate notice...requires a prompt
adjustment in this policy."

Bird also said EPA Region III is "unduly aggressive" in
implementing "Best Available Control Technology" (BACT)
requirements. The EPA region, Bird wrote, "appears to be seeking
technologies providing 95 to 99 percent SO2 removal that have not
been adequately demonstrated to be effective and economic for the
same type of generating unit." But Region IV next door is not
requiring such stringent removal levels, Bird added.

Region III's ardor, said Bird, is also out of step with the Bush
Administration's proposals to cap sulfur dioxide emissions and
require offsets for new units. "Assuming that a cap is retained,"
Bird wrote, "total SO2 emissions will be controlled regardless of
how BACT requirements are applied." With caps, Bird argued, "no
purpose is served by forcing developers to a higher level of
control on new units than they consider economic. On the
contrary, a key principle underlying the president's proposals is
that the control be achieved at the lowest cost."

SRP: AN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH PARK?

by Danialle Weaver
AIKEN, South Carolina--The Department of Energy's Savannah River
facility, located on 192,000 acres of reforested farmland in
western South Carolina, is a study in contrasts.

The site boasts state-of-the-art waste processing technology in
the Defense Waste Processing Facility (see story on page two), a
nearly complete facility that will render millions of gallons of
deadly defense wastes into a harmless glass matrix. At the same
time, the site serves as home to a weapons production technology
little changed in nearly four decades.

Like many of DOE's other weapons facilities, the site has been
designated a National Environmental Research Park that serves as
a refuge for five endangered species, including four bird
species--bald eagles, wood storks, red cockaded woodpeckers and
peregrine falcons--and one fish species, the short-nosed
sturgeon.

The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, operated on the site by
the University of Georgia, has a large environmental monitoring
effort to study the long-term health of the site's wildlife. In
fact, because the site's 320 square miles represent a virtual
oasis of greenery compared to the surrounding cropland, the DOE
facility is an excellent place to study the effects of genetic
isolation and natural selection in closed populations.

At the same time, the site also contains damnable examples of
environmental practices that have long since been disavowed,
notably seepage basins used for the land disposal of liquid low-
level wastes and low-level solid waste buried directly into the
ground.

One of the site's Carolina Bays--formed when the glaciers of the
ice age receded--was formerly home for several typical South
Carolina species of flora and fauna, including Venus flytraps and
alligators. But heavy metals and volatile organics, such as
trichloroethylene, from the nearby seepage basins seriously
contaminated the bay, which is now nicknamed "Lost Lake" by
workers at Savannah River.

Environmental restoration activities, including removing several
feet of lake mud and draining some of the lake water, have
helped, and life is slowly returning to Lost Lake. Seepage basins
and low level waste burial grounds are being cleaned up, capped
with a clay cap impermeable to rainwater and covered with new
vegetation.

DOE LOOKS TO VITRIFY ITS WASTE PROBLEMS AT THE SAVANNAH RIVER
FACILITY

by Danialle Weaver
AIKEN, South Carolina--In 1992, workers at the Department of
Energy's Savannah River site hope to write a new and hopeful
chapter in the long history of the U.S. struggle to find ways to
safely store the nation's most deadly radioactive waste for the
thousands of years it remains hazardous to human life and the
environment.

The solution, says Lucien Papouchado, manager of waste management
programs at Savannah River for Westinghouse Savannah River
Company, lies in vitrifying or glassifying the waste. Similar
technology has already been successfully adopted in France and
Belgium.

Although several waste vitrification facilities are slated to
begin operations in the U.S. in the 1990s and beyond, Savannah
River's $1.2 billion Defense Waste Processing Facility is
scheduled to come on-line first. The wastes generated by nearly
40 years of plutonium and tritium production at the site account
for 56 percent of the radioactivity in DOE's inventory of high-
level defense waste, according to recent estimates by the General
Accounting Office.

It took "15 years of R&D" to come up with the processes that will
be used at the DWPF, said Richard Begley, director of the
Savannah River Laboratory and a vice president for Westinghouse
Savannah River Company, the facility's operating contractor.
Bechtel served as architect-engineer for the facility and
Morrison-Knudsen served as the primary construction contractor.
Groundbreaking was held in late 1983.

Westinghouse and DOE plan to begin a series of "cold" processing
runs with simulated radioactive waste in September. Once the
facility begins operating, it will take approximately 15 years to
vitrify the 34 million gallons of liquid high-level waste already
stored at Savannah River.

The majority of DOE's liquid high-level defense waste is
generated in the process of recovering the uranium and plutonium
from the reactors' spent fuel rods. Before they ever reach the
vitrification facility, spent fuel rods are soaked in nitric acid
to dissolve the cladding. Then, the fuel itself is dissolved in
an aqueous solution of nitric acid, and an organic solvent is
used to separate the nitrates of uranium and plutonium from the
fission products.

Before the waste is placed in storage tanks, the acid is
neutralized with sodium hydroxide, and the radioactive elements
settle in a thick sludge on the bottom of the tanks. The liquid
on top, called supernate, makes up about 90 percent of the waste
and consists of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite.

The supernate, or salt solution, will then be evaporated at the
Savannah River saltstone facility, which is expected to start up
this year. The remaining "saltcake" will be treated to remove
cesium-137 and strontium, which will then be sent to the DWPF.
The saltcake will be mixed with cement, fly ash and furnace slag
and then pumped into a concrete storage vault, where it will cure
into a stable concrete. After the vault is filled, it will be
capped with clean concrete and backfilled with earth to isolate
it from rain and weathering.

At the vitrification facility, the waste will first be treated
with chemicals to remove the mercury introduced during
reprocessing. Then, the waste will be mixed with ground
borosilicate glass, fed into a melter and heated to 2,100 degrees
Fahrenheit. The melter is designed to turn a gallon of the waste
slurry into about four pounds of glassified waste at a rate of
228 pounds per hour. It will take about 16 hours to fill one
canister 85 percent full, according to Steve Sheetz, a senior
Westinghouse engineer.

Particles will be scrubbed from the waste gases generated by the
melter by water that is shot out of scrubber nozzles at very high
speed, trapping radioactive particles and separating them from
the gases. Any remaining particles will be caught by high
efficiency filters and a bed of sand.

From the melter, the waste will flow into stainless steel
canisters that are 10 feet high, 2 feet in diameter, and 3/8-inch
thick. The canisters, which weigh about 1,100 pounds empty, will
weigh approximately 4,800 pounds when filled, according to
Sheetz. The canisters hold about 3,700 lb. of glass. A temporary
plug will then be inserted, and the canisters decontaminated to
Department of Transportation standards using a slurry of ground
glass, Sheetz continued. Once they are decontaminated, the
canisters will be permanently sealed with a steel plug forced in
place by 70,000 pounds of hydraulic pressure. A 23,000 amp
current will then be applied to the plug for about two seconds,
resulting in a weld "far superior" than those from conventional
welding techniques, Sheetz said.

The canisters will then be transferred to a temporary glass waste
storage building, which Sheetz manages, where they will be stored
in below-ground concrete vaults until they can be shipped to a
federal repository.

All major operations at the facility will be performed by remote
control. Before equipment was installed in the facility,
engineers created full-scale mock-ups of the equipment to ensure
that it could be maintained and repaired via remote control.
Equipment can be removed and replaced using an overhead crane or
repaired in place using mechanical arms placed at strategic
locations along the walls of the facility.

NSWMA APPEALS ALABAMA HAZARDOUS WASTE COURT CASE

The National Solid Wastes Management Association has appealed a
federal District Court ruling that upheld Alabama's controversial
hazardous waste disposal legislation, the association announced
late last month. The court, in a January 12 ruling, upheld a law
that enables the state to ban shipments of hazardous waste from
states that do not have waste disposal facilities of their own.

NSWMA General Counsel Bruce Parker challenged the logic used by
the court in its ruling. "The issue of whether or not states have
complied with federal law to deal with their own hazardous wastes
cannot be used as independent grounds for allowing a state like
Alabama to violate the Constitution," Parker said, adding: "It is
our belief that the January 12 opinion did not address all of the
legal points we challenged in our suit and it improperly applied
some basic tenants of constitutional law."

The association is also concerned about the decision's impact on
the much-delayed Superfund clean-up program, Parker continued.
"We are sympathetic with Alabama's concerns that other states may
not have completed the required hazardous waste capacity
assurance process, but we can not allow Alabama to violate the
Constitution in an attempt to force other states to develop their
own hazardous waste management plans."

The association and Chemical Waste Management Inc., the owner of
the Emelle disposal facility affected by the decision and a joint
party to the lawsuit, filed their appeal with the Eleventh U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, along with a request for an
expedited briefing and hearing schedule.

The court's decision could have a negative impact on Chemical
Waste Management's stock, Debra Coy, an analyst with Washington
Analyst Corporation, warned in a recent issue of `Capital
Comments.' To date, the decision has not hurt the company's stock
price, Coy wrote. "However, we believe there's a good chance the
decision could be upheld, setting a precedent for other states
that want to restrict imports of waste, both solid and hazardous.
We also believe there could be an impact on landfill earnings if
some of the waste banned from the site is diverted to
competitors' landfills. We believe the recent court
decision...may be more worrisome to Chemical Waste Management
than most industry analysts have anticipated."

SENATE ENERGY HEARS KEY DOE NOMINEES

Two Department of Energy nominees received a friendly reception
from members of the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee
during a joint confirmation hearing on Monday.

Highlighting his technical training, managerial capability and
public service experience, John Bartlett, nominated as director
of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, pledged
"open, frequent and effective interactions with Congress" and
said he "hopes to achieve respect for DOE's management" of the
waste program during his tenure. Before becoming a DOE consultant
in November 1989, Bartlett directed energy and environment work
for The Analytic Sciences Corporation of Reading, Massachusetts.

Robert Gentile, nominated to become DOE's assistant secretary for
Fossil Energy, told the committee: "We're entering a new era in
which environmental rhetoric is being replaced by environmental
action yet we must at the same time be assured of an adequate
supply of energy at reasonable costs." Gentile was previously the
director of the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface
Mining.

NATURE CONSERVANCY BUYS GRAY RANCH

The Nature Conservancy has purchased the 321,703-acre Gray Ranch
in southwestern New Mexico, the Arlington, Virginia-based
organization announced last week. The purchase, for an
undisclosed amount, of the 502.6-square-mile parcel is believed
to be the largest private land acquisition in conservation
history. "The purchase of Gray Ranch is a milestone in
conservation history," said John Sawhill, the incoming president
of the Conservancy. "Few intact natural systems of this caliber
exist in the world today. The Gray Ranch also represents the
future trend for The Nature Conservancy and its partners. To
truly insure our natural world for future generations, we are
developing creative ways to safeguard much larger landscapes."

LUKEN ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT, DECISION LIKELY TO INFLUENCE RCRA
DEBATE

Rep. Thomas Luken (D-Ohio), the chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee,
announced late last month that he would not seek reelection this
fall. The announcement, which was something of a surprise, could
have a significant impact on reauthorization of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which is now pending before
Luken's subcommittee.

The 64-year-old's decision to retire will open a coveted seat on
the Energy and Commerce Committee when the 102nd Congress
convenes next year. Chairmanship of Luken's subcommittee will
likely be assumed by Rep. Al Swift (D-Wash.).

TRANSPORTATION

The House Energy and Commerce transportation and hazardous
materials subcommittee last week unanimously approved legislation
(H.R. 3520) that would tighten existing regulations on the
transportation of hazardous wastes. The bill would authorize the
hiring of 200 additional federal inspectors to enforce the new

JONTZ LAUDS BUSH FORESTRY PROPOSAL

The Bush Administration's plan to plant one billion trees at a
cost of $175 million should be linked with a reduction in the
number of trees cut on public lands in the Pacific Northwest,
Rep. Jim Jontz (D-Ind.) said last week. "With the president's
proposal, trees are finally receiving the attention they deserve
as the most cost-effective means of addressing the global warming
problem," Jontz said. "But to be responsible stewards of our
nation's environment, we must also take steps to stop the
destruction of our remaining old growth ancient forests. It is
ironic that at the same time the president proposes to do a
better job replanting trees where they were once cut, we are
liquidating our most magnificent forests faster than ever
before."

Jontz, a member of the House Agriculture forests, family farms
and energy subcommittee, is the sponsor of legislation (H.R.
2144) that would significantly boost federal support for urban
forestry initiatives. The bill, which passed the House in
November and is now pending before the Senate Agriculture
Committee, would establish a matching fund plan for urban areas
interested in setting up forestry programs. The fund would give
interested urban areas a dollar in federal money for every dollar
raised from local sources.

DELAWARE'S ROTH PUSHES `CLUNKER' INCENTIVE FOR EPA

Sen. William Roth (R-Del.) introduced legislation (S. 2049) last
week that would authorize the Environmental Protection Agency to
provide incentives to remove pre-1980 model year automobiles from
the country's highways. There are roughly 22 million cars still
on the road dating from before 1980, Roth said, and these autos
are "some of the biggest polluters on our nation's highways."
Overall, there are roughly nine million cars dating from before
1975 and another 13 million from the 1976-1979 model years.
Together, these two groups emit 1.1 million tons of hydrocarbons
a year--or somewhere between 15 percent and 30 percent of the
total annual automobile-generated hydrocarbon emissions.

"In fact," Roth continued, "I have heard estimates run as high
as 40 percent when one considers evaporative losses and other
losses, and it has been stated that about 60 percent of the
transportation-sector hydrocarbon emissions in southern
California come from clunkers."

The clean air legislation pending in the Senate ignores this
crucial source of pollution, Roth said, adding that his bill
would amend this shortcoming. The incentives in the Delaware
Republican's bill would focus principally on the existing
Corporate Average Fuel Economy or CAFE system. Specifically, the
legislation would give the manufacturers of newer automobiles
credits under the CAFE program whenever a post-1980 model was
sold to an individual trading in a pre-1980 automobile. To
qualify for this credit, which would be based on the difference
in gas mileage between the two automobiles, the manufacturer
would have to prove that the engine block and body of the older
car have been permanently removed from the road. Fines for
companies that do not comply would total $2,000 per car.

The legislation would be beneficial to all parties, Roth said.
"I can foresee a scenario where the owners of these clunkers
become valuable customers when they drive onto the new car lot
looking for a new fuel efficient, low-polluting car." For
example, a manufacturer could receive a CAFE credit of some 30
miles per gallon (mpg) if a customer trades in an older vehicle
getting just 10 mpg for a newer one at 40 mpg. Further, depending
on the size of the CAFE credit, part of the bonus could be
earmarked for the buyer to reduce the cost of the new
automobile.

"Consequently, the bill is good for everyone--for the
manufacturer, the retailer, the owner, but most importantly, for
the environment. We need to encourage more fuel efficient, safer
environmentally sound methods of transportation. This would be a
very good beginning," Roth concluded.

LOCAL ANGLE TOPS ENVIRONMENT AGENDA

by John Egan
HOUSTON--When it comes to the environment, many Americans seem to
have adopted an "out of sight, out of mind" attitude, according
to a nationwide survey commissioned by Cambridge Energy Research
Associates. A majority of those polled said they would help fund
local environmental issues, but far fewer people would be ready
to fund more geographically diffuse and intangible issues like
acid rain and global warming, adds the report, released here on
Monday in conjunction with CERA's annual executive meeting.

The study, `Energy and the Environment: The New Landscape of
Political Opinion,' was conducted by Cambridge, Massachusetts-
based Opinion Dynamics Corp. for CERA.

Mandatory recycling was favored by 88 percent of the 1,250 people
questioned in the survey. About 81 percent supported a ban on
non-biodegradable products, while 58 percent wanted to encourage
mass transit use by strictly limiting the amount of automotive
parking in cities.

Six out of ten of the respondents would "definitely" pay a one-
time $50 fee to help protect the nation's wildlife and wilderness
lands, according to the study. About 54 percent would also pay
the same-size tariff to clean up polluted water, while 50 percent
said they would dig into their pockets to help dispose of
hazardous chemicals and toxic wastes.

"The environmental consensus will be a major factor in the future
American political and business landscape," Daniel Yergin, CERA's
president, told a press conference where he unveiled the study.
"The popular-based support for environmental improvement cuts
across traditional demographic, partisan and ideological
divisions of American society, and could translate into far-
reaching political and economic consequences."

But while the public thinks the environment is important, other
issues are more pressing: Approximately 53 percent of those
surveyed said the U.S. government should spend more to battle
drug abuse. Uncle Sam should also spend more on public education,
according to 42 percent of those polled. By contrast, 40 percent
supported spending more to safely dispose of dangerous chemicals
and wastes, while only 28 supported spending more to clean the
nation's air.

As the issues covered by the survey became more global and less
tangible, fewer people said they would be willing to dig into
their pockets to support remediation efforts. Specifically, only
one-third of those surveyed would "definitely" give the U.S.
government $50 to counter either the greenhouse effect or acid
rain, according to the study. About 35 percent of those
questioned would give $50 to help solve municipal solid waste
disposal problems, while 37 percent were willing to fund programs
to counter ozone depletion. Slightly under half those surveyed
would spend $50 to help solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.

Nearly 20 percent of the respondents said they would refuse to
pay extra for efforts to curb diffuse problems like acid rain and
the greenhouse effect. By contrast, only about 10 percent of
those surveyed categorically refused to spend more of their money
on visible issues like protecting wildlife or cleaning up water
pollution.

Respondents differentiated between open-ended and one-time
tariffs. By a two-to-one margin they opposed cutting pollution
through a 50 cent per gallon gasoline tax. A majority also
rejected a 25 cent per gallon gasoline tax. "Open-ended taxes
with no dollar limits to be used for purposes only broadly and
vaguely defined do not win support from most Americans as an
acceptable price tag on environmental improvement," the report
warned.

Sixty-two percent of those surveyed believe that economic growth
and environmental clean-up can go hand-in-hand. If the economy
and the environment were locked in a zero-sum struggle, 74
percent would choose to have slower growth and a cleaner
environment. Only 16 percent of those queried would choose
economic growth over a cleaner environment.

EPA TARGETS PESTICIDE CONTAINERS: Farmer cooperation tops 90
percent

by Paul Kemezis
A successful pilot program to clean up and recycle pesticide
containers in Washington County, Mississippi could lead to
similar programs in several states, according to Environmental
Protection Agency officials familiar with the program.

Small, state-sponsored container collection efforts already exist
in Oregon and Maine, but a large-scale recycling program had
never been tried before in a densely farmed region. In addition,
the Mississippi pilot program was the first time that pressurized
spray cleaners were used and the empty high-density polyethylene
containers were sold for recycling, according to Robert Denny,
EPA's pesticide program manager.

Iowa is currently considering a statewide program and other
states, including North Dakota and Minnesota, have also expressed
interest in the pilot program's results. EPA, which provided
$80,000 for the Mississippi program, may allocate additional
funds from its special projects budget for similar programs,
Denny told Environment Week.

Washington County, which is located in a major cotton growing
region bordering the Mississippi River, launched the project in
the summer of 1989 to prevent used containers with pesticide
residues from being discarded in landfills, burned or simply
thrown in ditches. Farmers were given high pressure cleaning
equipment donated by ICI Americas Inc., and urged to flush the
containers and retain the pesticide residue to spray on fields.
After they were cleaned, the metal and plastic containers were to
be deposited at eight collection centers.

Mississippi Agriculture Dept. officials who ran the program say
the results were surprisingly good. All told, the department
collected 52,000 plastic containers and 48,000 pounds of metal
cans. Using a heavy publicity campaign including video tapes,
slide shows and local television ads, they estimate that they
achieved a 90 percent recovery rate. The program was totally
voluntary.

EPA's Denny says a principal goal of the program was to test the
results of the pressure rinsing, which has been shown to be 600
times more effective in removing residues than traditional triple
rinsing. The rinsing is particularly important because it
provides a cleaner product to sell to recyclers. Nevertheless,
use of the recycled plastic is still somewhat restricted because
of its previous pesticide contact.

Robert McCarty, deputy director of plant industry with the
state's Agriculture Dept., says the Washington County program
will continue next year using remaining EPA funds. The department
will also ask the legislature to fund a statewide program. While
the program generates some revenue from the sale of recycled
materials, it is not planned as a profit-making venture.

Notwithstanding the success of the pilot program, Denny says it
will be up to individual states to initiate and fund large-scale
programs. EPA plans to help by developing rules regarding
container shapes in order to make cleaning easier and also on
what can be used to construct the containers.

COALITION URGES $1 BILLION LAND PURCHASE PROGRAM

Congress should make better use of the billions of dollars
authorized for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to
acquire environmentally sensitive land and to create new public
recreation areas, a coalition of 20 national conservation groups
recommended in a report released last week. During the 1980s, the
coalition said, the unappropriated balance in the conservation
fund climbed from zero to more than $7 billion as the Reagan
Administration consistently failed to appropriate the funds
available. "During the 25th anniversary year of the Land and
Water Conservation Fund, we believe it is time to renew our
commitment to present and future generations through the
appropriation of $999 million in fiscal year 1991," the heads of
the 20 groups wrote in a cover letter accompanying the report.

Specifically, the coalition proposed spending:

 *  $253.05 million for land acquisition activities by the U.S.
    Fish and Wildlife Service;
 *  $249.18 million for the National Park Service;
 *  $242.98 million for the U.S. Forest Service;
 *  $200 million for state grants; and
 *  $54.15 million for the Bureau for Land Management;

The LWCF, which was signed into law by former president Johnson,
is composed primarily of revenues raised from leasing activity on
the Outer Continental Shelf and royalties associated with OCS oil
and gas production.

The coalition's report identifies lands in 46 states, the
District of Columbia and four U.S. territories that should be
purchased during the coming fiscal year. In crafting its
suggestions for land purchases, the coalition focused particular
attention on areas where there is a serious threat to land, water
or wildlife; willing sellers; existing acquisition efforts; and
existing or expected court orders that will require the federal
government to compensate landowners.

"During the fund's silver anniversary, we should be bold enough
to invest the $1 billion proposed in 1987 by President Reagan's
Commission of Americans Outdoors," urged Wilderness Society
president George Frampton in releasing the report. "Every day
there is less open space left in America, and unless we act
quickly, many of the natural treasures that our report recommends
for purchase will be gobbled up by subdivisions and other
speculators."

ARIZONA

Phoenix, Arizona's voluntary recycling pilot program has been so
successful in the past year that it will be expanded city-wide,
the city announced recently. The newly expanded program will
include 300,000 homes, compared to the 4,000 homes in the pilot
program. "This expansion will occur pending evaluation of
economics and end market agreements," said Jack Friedline, deputy
public works director for the city. "Full evaluation of the pilot
program will be made in the second quarter this year. If economic
analysis shows a benefit, we will recommend a multi-year
implementation program probably from 1991 to 1995."

CONNECTICUT

Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection has awarded
$60,000 in grant funds to municipalities in the state's Central
Naugatuck Valley to boost regional recycling efforts. The funds
will be used by the Valley's council of governments to institute
a comprehensive regional recycling program for the area's roughly
370,000 residents. "This is one more important step forward for
Connecticut's recycling movement," DEP Commissioner Leslie
Carothers said in announcing the grant award. "This grant will
help add more than 10 percent of the state's population in the
Central Naugatuck Valley join the large numbers of citizens
already involved in regional recycling around Connecticut." The
grant will help the Valley's municipalities comply with a state
law mandating recycling for nine items by January 1, 1991,
including: glass and metal food containers, newspaper, corrugated
and white office paper, scrap metal, automotive batteries, used
oil and leaves.

NEBRASKA

The Nebraska Department of Environmental Control and the Attorney
General's Office have filed suit in Hitchcock County against
Texaco Producing, Inc. for allegedly contaminating surface and
groundwater during the company's operations in the area. The
department is seeking to have the contamination cleaned up, and
to collect civil penalties and the cost of the investigation from
the company. "We have asked the court to make Texaco assess the
contamination and clean it up," said Steve Moeller, the state's
assistant attorney general. "We're also asking for civil
penalties of up to $5,000 per day, and the payment of $20,000 to
cover the cost of our investigation."

Environmental protection efforts have been a cornerstone of
Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey's administration, and 1990
will be no exception if the Republican governor has his way. In
his State of the State address late last month, Casey announced
the signing of an executive order requiring all new passenger
cars sold in the state to comply by 1994 with the tight emissions
standards now in effect in California. "To set the example,"
Casey continued, "I've ordered that all new state vehicles meet
these standards, effective immediately. In addition, we're going
to toughen up inspection standards so they cover emission control
devices."

ARB MODIFIES ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MANDATE

SACRAMENTO -- The Calif. Air Resources Board (ARB) staff has
proposed changes to the current Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) rule,
scheduled for introduction in 1998.  The ZEV modification, endorsed
by Governor Wilson, would retain the requirement for full
implementation by 2003.

Background

In 1994, Governor Wilson submitted California's State
Implementation Plan (SIP), under the 1990 Clean Air Act.  The plan
set forth the state's strategies to achieve clean air by
implementing cost-effective regulations which encourage the advance
of technology through market forces.  One of the most controversial
elements of the SIP is the ZEV mandate.

Under the terms of the ZEV regulation, adopted in 1990, major
automakers are required to offer vehicles with no tailpipe
emissions in 2 percent of their fleets by 1998.  The number
increases to 5 percent in 2001 and ultimately to 10 percent in
2010.

An alternative to the present rule was requested by the ARB after
auto makers' projections indicated the sales demand for lead/acid
batteries with limited mileage ranges would not appeal to enough
buyers to meet the rules.

In response to concerns such as cost/marketability, technology, the
use of hybrids and the development of infrastructure needs, the ARB
submitted to the Governor, a proposal to modify the ZEV rule, while
maintaining the ultimate long-term goal.

ARB Proposal

ARB Staff's preliminary proposal is to drop the 2 percent
requirement in the early years of the program and build up to 10
percent ZEVs by 2003, when all car companies that sell more than
3000 vehicles per year statewide must comply with the regulation.
In addition, manufacturers will receive extra ZEV credit through
2003 for ZEVs sold before 1998 and those equipped with advance
battery types that have the range and lifespan that many experts
believe is needed to make them competitive with gasoline powered
models.  Those battery types, including lithium and nickel-based
designs, are expected to be commercially available by 2001.

The staff proposal would suspend the current ZEV requirements until
2003, and propose that auto manufacturers participate in a
partnership program to promote and evaluate the development of
advanced ZEVs.  All of the exhaust, evaporative and refueling
emission reductions associated with the existing ZEV requirements,
plus a premium, would be made up by the manufacturers through the
production of cleaner cars.

ARB staff has been directed to fully develop the plan and present
it for consideration at a public hearing no later than March 1996.

In his endorsement of the ZEV modification proposal, Governor
Wilson said, "This proposal...would retain the requirement for full
implementation of the ZEV mandate by 2003.  But it will also permit
modifications that both allow enforceable emission benefits that
exceed existing requirements and at the same time encourage early
development of battery technology that will produce ZEVs the market
will accept."

STUDY RELEASED ON DIOXIN EMISSIONS FROM WASTE COMBUSTION

NEW YORK -- The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has
released a study that concludes there is no correlation between the
amount and type of chlorine in the waste constituents of combustion
facilities and dioxin concentrations measured at the stack.

The study, "The Relationship Between Chlorine in Waste Streams and
Dioxin Emissions from Waste Combustor Stacks," analyzed more than
1,900 test results, and concludes that limiting the chlorine
content of combustor feedstocks has no, or little, effect on the
composition or quantity of dioxin emitted.

According to ASME, the finding refutes claims by public interest
groups that there is a direct relationship between chlorine and
dioxin, or PCDD/F, emissions.  ASME says these groups have been
seeking regulations limiting the amount and type of chlorinated
waste that can be combusted in waste-to-energy plants, hazardous
waste incinerators, cement kilns, and other types of combustion
systems.

Copy Availability

A copy of the study is available from ASME, (800) 843-2763.

MARGETT INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO OVERRIDE CFC BAN IN CALIFORNIA

SACRAMENTO -- Assemblyman Bob Margett (R-Arcadia) has introduced
legislation that would repeal the federal ban on
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which became effective on Jan. 1, 1996.

AB 1996 would allow the use, possession, and production of CFCs in
California, despite the Federal ban.  The bill, known as the
California Air Conditioner Protection Act of 1996, would delay the
prohibition of freon until the year 2000.

According to Margett, "What we have, is a classic example of
state's rights.  The Tenth Amendment of the Untied States
Constitution gives states powers not delegated to the Federal
government by the Constitution.  Last time I checked, the
Constitution was silent on the issue of freon and CFCs."

"I wanted to take a reasonable approach to the freon issue.  In
giving industry a much needed extension to thoroughly study the
effects of freon on the environment while still protecting
California's consumers," Margett said.

More Information

Margett and principle co-author Senator Richard Mountjoy, are
trying to build a state wide coalition of consumers and businesses
in support of AB 1996.  For information contact Margett's office at
(916) 445-7234.

51-MONTH JAIL TERM FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE VIOLATIONS

WASHINGTON -- U.S. EPA has announced a 51-month incarceration
sentence for Reginald B. Gist, former operator of High Tech Plating
System, in Balch Springs, Texas.  Gist was sentenced for allegedly
improperly disposing and transporting of hazardous wastes generated
by his electroplating businesses.

In addition to the jail sentence, Gist is required to pay
restitution in excess of $75,000 and may not operate another
plating business.

Gist was one of the owners of the High Tech Plating from 1988 -
1990.  Following repeated notices to him by Dallas County waste
water control authorities that his business had been illegally
dumping electroplating waste into the sewer system, the sewer
connection was disconnected.  Gist admitted that he abandoned the
facility, leaving plating vats and 55-gallon drums containing more
than 70,000 gallons of hazardous wastes, including acids, cyanides
and heavy metals.  EPA cleaned up the site at a cost in excess of
$300,000.

According to court records, Gist opened a new company, Metal
Plating Systems in Forney, Texas, where liquid plating wastes were
dumped into the septic system and onto the surrounding ground.  He
also hauled liquid and solid plating wastes to property he owned at
Lake Fork, Texas.  When the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission discovered the contamination at the Forney facility,
Gist was ordered to remove the contaminated soil and dispose of it
properly.

As part of the pleas agreement, Gist admitted that rather than
dispose of the contaminated soil properly, he transported it to the
Lake Fork property where it was either buried or dumped on the
ground.  Gist left the Forney location in 1992 and moved Metal
Plating Systems to Terrell, Texas.

On Sept. 22, Gist pled guilty to one count of unlawful disposal of
hazardous waste at Balch Springs and one count of unlawful
transportation of hazardous waste from the Forney and Terrell
locations to Lake Fork, in violation of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA).  EPA estimates that the Agency spent in
excess of $450,000 to cleanup the Terrell Facility, alone.

JUDGE REVERSES RULING ON FISH AND GAME CEQA FEES

SACRAMENTO -- Sacramento Superior Court Judge Jeffery Gunther has
reversed his previous ruling and ordered the Dept. of Fish and Game
to collect fees charged for the implementation of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the review of environmental
impact documents of major developments in accordance with Fish and
Game Code Section 711.4.

The ruling was the result of an action taken by the California
Association of Professional Scientists (CAPS).  CAPS sued Fish and
Game to set aside a settlement agreement with private land owners
that required the department to cease and desist the collection of
approximately $3 million in annual fees.  Judge Gunther had
previously approved the settlement agreement.

CAPS argued that Judge Gunther's approval of the settlement was
unconstitutional.  Section 3.5 of the State Constitution prohibits
an administrative agency from refusing to obey a state law in the
absence of a ruling from an appellate court that the law is
unconstitutional.

According to CAPS, the settlement that was overturned had been
entered into after Judge Gunther ruled the fees statute was
unconstitutional.

In reversing his approval of the settlement, Judge Gunther strongly
expressed his unhappiness with the constitutional provision
prohibiting agencies from refusing to enforce statute law on the
basis of a Superior Court decision, but ultimately acknowledged
that the Constitution controls.

CAPS says an appeal of the court's decision in likely.

CAPS represents approximately 2,400 state employed scientists,
including several hundred biologists and related resource
professionals working for the Dept. of Fish and Game.

The fees generated by the Environmental Review Procedure, for which
the fees are collected, result in a significant portion of the
department's annual budget.

LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LAB TO ASSIST CAL/EPA WITH TECHNOLOGY
EVALUATIONS

SACRAMENTO/LIVERMORE -- Under a Memorandum of Agreement singed last
month between Cal/EPA's Dept. of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)
and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, scientists and
engineers from the Lab will help develop and commercialize new
environmental technologies.  The lab will provide personnel and Lab
facilities to evaluate new environmental technologies seeking
certification under the Environmental Technology Certification
program.

According to DTSC, the agreement:

*Creates a wider, more diverse pool of available scientific and
engineering expertise available for the testing of technologies.

*Makes available additional scientific, testing and laboratory
facilities to evaluate environmental technologies, and

*Enhances the credibility of the certification through the
synergism of California's reputation for environmental standards
and Lawrence Livermore's reputation for technology development.

"Our partnership brings together the field and regulatory
experience of Cal/EPA with the research and development experience
of the Lab," said Cal/EPA Secretary James Strock.  "This
combination will provide a tremendous resource to the environmental
technology industry and allow for greater capability to certify
more technologies."

TWO ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES ENTER CIRCULATION

SACRAMENTO -- Secretary of State Bill Jones has announced that two
new environmental initiative measures have entered circulation for
petition signatures.

Beverage Container Recycling Program.  Wine and Liquor Containers.

This initiative proposes to amend the existing recycling law to add
wine and liquor containers to beverage containers on which
distributors are assessed a charge.  If adopted, the measure would
increase funding for recycling and anti-litter programs from
program-generated revenues.  In addition, it would provide
financial incentive for sterilization and refilling of recycled
containers.

The estimated annual cost of the state recycling program would
increase by approximately $2 million.  Additional recycling program
revenue increases are estimated at $20 to 25 million annually.

More Information

The proponent of this initiative is Mark Murray of Californians
Against Waste, (916) 443-5422.  He must submit 433,269 signatures
of registered voters to county officials by May 30, 1996.

Radioactive Waste Disposal. Initiative Statute.

This initiative would prohibit the disposal of low-level
radioactive waste in the state by means of burial.  It would
require low-level radioactive wastes generated by medical,
biomedical or biotechnical industries to be managed using
retrievable and monitored facilities.

The proposal would also establish a third party liability fund for
injury to persons or property from waste disposal, paid for through
surcharge on waste generators.  It also exempts the state from
costs or liability for waste storage or disposal, except for wastes
generated by state and local agencies.

It is estimated that the measure would result in one-time state and
county costs ranging from $8 million to $13.5 million, and ongoing
annual costs of approximately $1 million to $2 million.

More Information

The proponent of this initiative is Ernest Goitstein, (415) 369-
6690.  He must collect 433.269 signatures of registered voters by
June 3, 1996.

GOVERNOR CALLS SPECIAL SESSION FOR CONTINUATION OF METHYL BROMIDE
REGISTRATION

SACRAMENTO -- At the end of December, Governor Pete Wilson called
a special session of the California Legislature to consider
legislation that would allow the continued registration of methyl
bromide and pentachlorophenol.

Methyl bromide is a widely used pesticide to control insects,
mites, rodents, plant diseases, nematodes, termites, and for
pretreating soil prior to planting a number of agricultural corps.
Pentachlorophenol is a wood preservative used by all major utility
companies in California to protect power and telephone poles from
destruction by wood-eating pests.

Currently, some of California's major trading partners including
Japan, Korea and Mexico require methyl bromide treatment on
agricultural products prior to shipping.  New Zealand and Australia
require all shipments of products in wooden crates or pallets to be
treated with it to prevent pests from entering their countries.

Existing law requires manufacturers of pesticides to conduct health
effect studies and submit them to the state for evaluation.
Current law requires that the registration of methyl bromide be
suspended after March 30, 1996, if the necessary studies are not
submitted by then.

According to a recent study released by the Calif. Dept. of Food
and Agriculture (CDFA) the state could loose up to $346 million in
revenues and 9,894 full-time jobs annually, from the suspension of
methyl bromide registration.

Ongoing scientific debate between Cal/EPA and U.S. EPA regarding
how these studies should be conducted, delayed the initiation of
the studies.  Consequently, the last toxilogical study for methyl
bromide will not be completed until December 1997.

At the end of the last legislative session, SB 808 by Senator Dick
Monteith (R-Modesto) and Assemblyman Peter Frusetta (R-San Benito)
that would have resolved this problem, failed passage.  A special
session provides a practical way to extend the statutory deadline
for the submittal of the last methyl bromide study.  The special
session will run concurrently with the regular Legislative session.

At this time, in the Third Special Session, SB 1 (Henry Mellow, D-
Monterey),  SB 2 (Monteith) and AB 1 (Frusetta) have been
introduced.  Each bill would extend the methyl bromide study
deadline to December 1997.  Last week AB 1 passed the Assembly
Appropriation Committee (11-4).  It is currently scheduled for
hearing on the Assembly Floor.  SB 1 and SB 2 are scheduled for
hearing in the Senate Health and Human Services Committee on Jan.
24.  (For more information on these bills, see the California Bill
Report.)

Legislation passed during a special session go into effect on the
91st day after adjournment of the special session, while those
passed during a regular session of the Legislature go into effect
on January 1 of the following year.

WORKER PROTECTION STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION HEARINGS SCHEDULED

SACRAMENTO -- The Dept. of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) has scheduled
six workshop/hearings throughout the state on the implementation of
the federal Worker Protection Standard (WPS) in California.

Current California regulations place requirements on employers of
pesticide handlers and fieldworkers.  Currently the handler portion
of the regulations is applicable to all pesticide use situations:
the fieldworker portion is applicable to employees working in
treated agricultural fields; handler regulations cover protection
of study participants, hazard communication, emergency medical
care, training, personal protective equipment, decontamination
facilities, medical supervision, change areas, light, and closed
handling systems.  Fieldworker regulations encompass posting, and
reentry into, treated fields, training, emergency medical care,
decontamination facilities, and hazard communication.

By implementing the WPS in California, the coverage of both the
handler and fieldworkers of the WPS are limited to the commercial
or research production of agricultural plant commodities on farms,
forests, greenhouses, and nurseries.  Although the WPS addresses
most, but not all, of the same areas covered by current California
requirements.

The following hearings have been scheduled on Worker Protection
Standards:

Salinas - February 21

Salinas Community Center (Santa Lucia Room), 940 North Main St.,
Salinas, 93901.

Sacramento - February 26

Secretary of State Auditorium, 1500 - 11th St., Sacramento, 95814.

Visalia Area - February 28

UC Kearney Agriculture Center, 9240 South Riverbend Ave., Parlier,
93648.

ADDITIONAL COMMENT PERIOD FOR EXTENDED PESTICIDE USE

WASHINGTON -- Under the terms of a recent settlement agreement,
U.S. EPA will provide additional opportunity for public comment
before the Agency extends the time period during which "existing
stocks" of certain canceled pesticides can be used.

The settlement resolves a lawsuit brought by the United Farm
Workers of America (UFW) against EPA.  UFW sued the Government on
behalf of migrant workers who were exposed to the pesticide,
mevinphos, which was later canceled.  The workers learned that EPA
extended the period during which the manufacturer could continue to
sell "existing stocks" of the canceled pesticide.

Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA), a manufacturer's registration of a pesticide can be
canceled if the pesticide poses an unreasonable health or
environmental threat.  In some cases, upon the request of a
manufacturer, EPA can permit the sale and use of existing stocks of
the canceled pesticides.

Through the settlement, EPA has agreed to go beyond the existing
terms of FIFRA, and provide public notice and an opportunity to
comment before it modifies the time period during which existing
stocks of certain canceled pesticides can be used.

"[This] settlement is part of EPA's ongoing efforts to increase
public involvement in the pesticide regulatory process," said Lynn
Goldman, EPA's Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides,
and Toxic Substances.

EPA is expected to publish its policy early this spring.

CROSS CONTAMINATION OF PESTICIDE PRODUCTS POLICY RELEASED

WASHINGTON -- Last month, a new policy that sets numerical limits
of contamination for all categories of pesticides, above which U.S.
EPA would consider the contaminant to toxicologically significant,
was released by the Agency.

In a notice issued to pesticide registrants (PR Notice 95-X), EPA
explained the Agency's new interpretation of what "toxicologically
significant" means in terms of contamination of pesticide active
ingredients, particularly as it pertains to the contamination of
one pesticide by another.  The new policy will allow EPA to focus
its attention on the contamination issues that pose a risk for
health and the environment.

According to the objectives in the PR notice, the new policy
should:

* set a clear standard that can be readily applied by the regulated
industry, as well as EPA;

* maintain accountability of the product form the producer to end
user;

* minimize the possibility that cross contamination will pose a
significant problem; and

* not preclude marketplace or private solutions to correct problems
that do arise.

Under the new policy, which goes into effect after a 60-day comment
period, EPA will move from a "zero-based" to a "risk based"
approach in considering the "toxicological significance" of
contamination of one pesticide by another.  Risk considerations
include potential human health effects from both dietary and non-
dietary exposure, ecological effects, potential groundwater
contamination and the potential for leaving unwanted residues on
food.

EPA has concluded that potential toxicity to plants by the
contaminant poses the greatest potential for harm, given the low
concentration of contamination being considered.

A contaminant that is toxicologically significant must be reported
to EPA for a determination of its potential effects and possible
corrective or regulatory action.

More Information

Copies of the new policy are available form EPA's Office of
Pesticide Communications, (703) 305-5017.

TWO PESTICIDES BANNED TO REDUCE POLLUTION IN BAY AND ESTUARIES

SACRAMENTO -- Emergency regulations to prohibit the sale and use of
pesticide products containing copper sulfate or tributyltin (TBT)
in nine Bay Area counties, have been announced by Cal/EPA.  Both
pesticides have been proven harmful to San Francisco Bay and its
estuaries.

The ban affects copper sulfate-containing pesticide products that
are poured into sewers and drains to kill plant and tree roots.
The affected TBT products are used in cooling towers in larger air
conditioning systems to control microorganisms that can cause
fouling.  The pesticides are prohibited for use in Alameda, Contra
Costs, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano,
and Sonoma counties.

Cal/EPA Secretary James Strock said, "Because we know that these
products have important uses, our scientists developed information
on alternative methods for controlling root intrusion in sewer
lines and microorganisms in many air conditioning systems.  This is
an excellent example of how environmental and economic progress can
be successfully combined."

UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK LEAKAGE MAY BE LESS OF A THREAT

SACRAMENTO -- According to a recent study by Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (LLNL), the impact of some leaking underground
storage tanks on the environment maybe less than previously
thought.

The independent study supports increasing evidence that many sites
within California present a low risk to the environment once the
tanks have been removed, and may require only monitoring to ensure
that the contaminated plume is stable and not contaminating other
areas.

In response to the study, recent state and public concern regarding
expensive regulatory oversight in the cleanup of leaking
underground fuel storage tanks, the State Water Resources Control
Board (SWRCB) has advised the state Regional Water Quality Control
Board and local oversight Programs to halt active remediation and
begin monitoring programs in cases containing low risk groundwater
exposure.  According to Cal/EPA, this will assure that State
attention is focused on better remediation of high risk sties and
situations.

Cal/EPA Secretary James Strock said, "This initial act by the Water
Board is among the first regulatory reforms resulting from Governor
Wilson's recent executive Order W-127-95.  We heard about the
urgency of this issue in our public forums in November, and now we
are taking action."

The report, "Recommendations to Improve the Cleanup Process for
California's Leaking Underground Fuel Tanks," was presented to the
SWRCB in October.  The report also recommends that passive
bioremediation be considered the primary remediation tool in most
cases, once the fuel leak source has been removed.

Typically, low risk cases involve shallow groundwater with a
maximum depth to water less than 50 feed and without drinking water
wells screened in the shallow groundwater zone with 250 feet of the
leak.

CPUC SETS UTILITY FUNDING LIMITS FOR LOW EMISSION VEHICLES -- The
Calif. Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has set the dollar amount
utilities can recover in rates to fund low emission vehicle (LEV)
programs for the next six years.  The combined utility LEV program
funding request totaled $426,652,000.  The CPUC approved
$171,421,000 (40 percent) of this amount.  Ratepayers will fund
$132,408,000.  Shareholders will fund the remainder.  The LEV
programs are intended to comply with Legislative mandate to
facilitate purchase and use of electric and natural gas vehicles in
California.

study released by U.S. EPA estimates the value of health benefits
from the reduction of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from
utilities, under the acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act
Amendments, at between $3 billion and $11 billion for 1997.  The
report focused on 31 eastern states where sulfates are a
substantial problem.
   It is estimated that by 2010, when the acid rain reduction
program will be fully implemented, the annual U.S. health benefits
will range between $12 billion and $40 billion.  According to the
report, reductions in premature deaths account for approximately 88
percent of the total health benefits; reductions in the number of
new cases of chronic bronchitis account for another nine percent of
the total.  More Information:  Copies of the study are available
from the Acid Rain Hotline, (202) 233-9620.

ELECTRIC VEHICLES

GOVERNOR COMMENDS GENERAL MOTORS ON VEHICLE DEBUT -- Governor Pete
Wilson has congratulated John Smith, Jr., chairman of the General
Motors (GM) Corporation, on the debut of the EV1, the first
purpose-built electric vehicle to be available to the public in
Southern California later this year.  "Making this revolutionary
vehicle available to the public will inevitably accelerate the
competition to produce zero emission vehicles, and will help us
reach California's mandate of having 10% of the automobiles for
sale be ZEVs [Zero Emission Vehicles] by 2003," the Governor said.
   GM introduced the EV1 on January 4.  The two-seat vehicle will
be marketed this fall.  The company has spent approximately $350
million on electric car development.

Assembly Bills

AB 1983 (MILLER) CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS
   Existing law prohibits the prescribed manufacture or sale of
specified chlorofluorocarbons or aerosol propellants containing
a chlorofluorocarbon.  Existing law limits, as specified, the
sale of motor vehicles equipped with CFC-based products, and
requires motor vehicle manufacturers to submit specified
information in that regard to the State Air Resources Board.
   This bill would repeal those provisions.  The bill would
provide that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
person may possess, use, manufacture, purchase, install,
transport, or sell chlorofluorocarbons, and the possession, use,
manufacture, purchase, installation, transportation, or sale of
chlorofluorocarbons does not subject any person, this state, or
any political subdivision of this state to any penalty, fine,
retaliatory action, or other punitive measure.

AB 1996 (MARGETT) FREON: AIR-CONDITIONING
   Existing law prohibits the prescribed manufacture or sale of
specified chlorofluorocarbons or aerosol propellants containing
a chlorofluorocarbon.  Existing law limits, as specified, the
sale of motor vehicles equipped with CFC-based products, and
requires motor vehicle manufacturers to submit specified
information in that regard to the State Air Resources Board.
Existing federal law prohibits the production or use of certain
chlorofluorocarbons.
   This bill would provide that, notwithstanding any such
provision of law, until January 1, 2000, the production,
manufacture, use, and sale of freon for express use in
automotive and home air-conditioning units and home appliances
does not subject any person, this state, or any political
subdivision of this state to any penalty, fine, other punitive
measure, or enforcement action.

STATUS: ASSEMBLY DESK
-----------------------------------------------------------------
AB 2009 (CORTESE) WASTE: SOLID WASTE FACILITIES: PERMITS
   Existing law, the California Integrated Waste Management Act
of 1989, regulates the management of solid waste.  The act
requires the California Integrated Waste Management Board and
certified local enforcement agencies to perform specified
functions with regard to the regulation of solid waste
management, including the issuance and enforcement of solid
waste facilities permits.  The board is required to concur or
object to the issuance, modification, or revision of any solid
waste facilities permit within 60 days of the board's receipt of
any proposed solid waste facilities permit. However, the board
is required to object to the permit and to submit its
determination and specific objections to the local enforcement
agency, the applicant, and the city or county within which the
facility is located, until a countywide integrated waste
management plan has been approved by the board, if the board
makes a determination concerning specified diversion
requirements.
   This bill would delete that requirement that the board object
to the permit until the countywide integrated waste management
plan is approved.
   The bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately
as an urgency statute.

SB 1371 (MELLO) ECONOMIC POISONS
   Under the Birth Defect Prevention Act of 1984, the Department
of Food and Agriculture was required by December 31, 1985, to
identify pesticide active ingredients that the department
determined had the most significant data gaps and widespread use
and that were suspected to be hazardous to people.
   Under the act, the Director of Pesticide Regulation also was
required on January 15, 1992, to issue a notice of the impending
suspension of the registration of those pesticide products
containing an active ingredient with a significant data gap for
which the registrant had not submitted required data by December
31, 1991.
   However, existing law provides that notwithstanding these
provisions, if the director finds that delays in submitting the
mandatory health effects studies were primarily caused by
actions of the Department of Pesticide Regulation, the director,
with the concurrence of the Secretary for Environmental
Protection, may extend the deadlines for submitting the
mandatory health effects studies for certain ingredients,
including, among others, pentachlorophenol and methyl bromide.
   In addition, under the act, no pesticide product containing
specified active ingredients for which the required studies have
not been submitted by March 30, 1996, shall remain registered
in this state after that date.
   This bill would revise these latter provisions to specify, in
addition, that no pesticide product containing methyl bromide
or pentachlorophenol for which the required studies have not
been submitted by December 31, 1997, shall remain registered
after those respective dates.

requires the purchase of the listed materials only when they are
available, of a fitness and quality equal to their nonrecycled
product and are not more costly than 5% of the lowest price
quoted by suppliers.  Existing law would repeal on January 1,
1997.
   This bill would delete the repeal date of January 1, 1997,
thereby continuing the requirement that all state agencies
purchase the listed materials indefinitely.

CONVERGENCE

A senior official of the Austrian Environment Ministry raised an
intriguing question at the end of last year (this issue p5): will the
presence of the three new member states of the European Union, Austria,
Finland and Sweden, lead to future ecological criteria comparable to
the convergence criteria set as pre-conditions for economic and
monetary union (EMU)?  From one point of view, the notion of an
environmental equivalent to the EMU convergence criteria would be seen
by some Euro-sceptics as just another potty idea from Europhiles who
have lost contact with reality.  After all, the member states are
having enough difficulty getting their economies into line for EMU at
the moment, to the point where even Germany seems to be waivering on
the timetable.

On the other hand, the mere stating of such a thought tells us
something about the changing balance of power within the EU on
environmental policy.  The three new states which joined in 1995 have
added an important new block of votes within EU Council meetings on the
side of environmental rigour.  Their decisions to join the Union were
hard fought internally and were predicated upon a determination to
retain their own higher-than-EU environmental standards and an
understanding that other like-minded member states would help them to
raise the whole EU regulatory framework into line.  Each had to
overcome considerable doubts about the commitment of the EU to
environmental protection before they could persuade their populations
to support accession.

For a variety of reasons, including high disposable income, exposure to
imported pollution by air or water, vulnerable and highly prized
natural assets, and cultures insured in a certain brand of civic
responsibility, these countries had already gone beyond the existing EU
standards in a number of environmental fields.  There were others where
they had done less, but those received rather less publicity and, in
any case, the public in these countries does appear overall to be more
willing than their colleagues in some other EU states to support public
spending on environmental objectives.

In the course of the negotiations about their joining the EU, the three
new members secured a deal which allowed them to keep environmental
standards which exceeded EU requirements for up to four years while the
European Commission attempted to persuade the rest of the Union to
revise the common rules upwards.  The EU gave no binding commitment to
such upward revisions at the end of the four-year transition period;
what it agreed to was to try to achieve that and to convene a full
review of the standards at issue at the end of the period, giving the
new members a chance to participate in the review on an equal footing
with those which had arrived before but also obliging them to come into
line with whatever emerges.  The open-ended nature of this agreement
seems to have been somewhat glossed over within the three countries,
where the public has been assured that there is absolutely no way the
EU is going to force them to back down on their tight standards.

The governments involved, which had stuck their necks out politically
to support EU entry, have limited room for manoeuvre on this, because
the anti-EU campaigns made great play of the argument that their proud
national environmental standards would be undermined by EU membership.
Having now gone in, it is therefore imperative to prove them wrong by
showing that there has been no back-tracking and that, on the contrary,
the new members have helped to raise the level of protection throughout
the Union.

Because there is still some way to go before the transition period
expires, differing perceptions about what has been agreed can be safely
left alone for the time being, in the knowledge that, on some of the
critical issues, the previous member states had already accepted that
existing regulations were out of date.  Nevertheless, as the Inter-
Governmental Conference (IGC) to decide the next steps towards
integration of the EU approaches, environmental policy seems set to
play a greater part in the proceedings than ever before.  Some
observers even think that it could become a serious obstacle to further
progress, both among the existing fifteen members and in relation to
accepting new countries from central and east Europe (CEE).

Both the new entrants and several longer-standing members have an
agenda for the IGC meetings in Turin which amounts to a clear stepping
up of environmental regulation, including greater use of qualified
majority voting within Environment Council meetings and less recourse
to the principle of subsidiarity.  That principle, the same Austrian
official said, " should be interpreted restrictively and not in the
sense of impeding environmental policies at Community level .... In any
case," she went on "we should avoid a narrow-minded interpretation of
this important principle."

Although some items on these countries' agenda will be agreed all
round, other objectives on their lists will set them directly at odds
with less enthusiastic member states which either think that regulation
has gone far enough in a certain field or believe that it should be
left to national governments.  Perhaps more importantly, since the EU
is well accustomed to such internal struggles, the new strengthening of
the environmental harmonisation voice also risks worsening a potential
collision between existing EU members and the countries which hope to
be the next in line.  In particular, the countries of central and east
Europe (CEE) have high expectations of early EU accession and such
hopes are only increased by signs of political instability in Russia.
And yet, the task of approximating their environmental laws and
standards in a wide range of fields to those of the EU remains a
daunting one (this issue p7).

Estimates of the cost of this approximation process vary widely, with
figures like ECU100bn (US$78.6bn) or even ECU300bn quoted for the
region as a whole.  At the same time, the enormous environmental
problems faced by these countries remain somewhat side-lined by urgent
economic objectives, presenting the governments concerned with endless
reasons for postponing painful and expensive environmental reforms and
for restraining environmental enforcement.  Real progress is
undoubtedly being made and there is no shortage of people at all levels
who are determined to push through such reforms.  The problem is that
this is very difficult and there is no shortage of momentum for plenty
of other crying needs as well.

Amid this potentially awkward conflict between member states insisting
on an upward revision of EU standards and politically sensitive
aspiring members who have a huge task ahead just to get close to the
pre-conditions for entry, EU policy-makers are working hard to inject
more realism into the debate.  In doing so, they have to take on board
on both the ecological imperatives of countries like Austria, Sweden,
Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, and the need for practical ways
forward in the CEE countries.

One fear is that this could all lead inexorably towards a split or even
a series of splits into two- or three-speed Europes, the implications
of which are distinctly uncomfortable for many people.  The danger is
that failure to reconcile these ill-matched goals could bring progress
towards CEE accessions to a halt and that such a setback would
undermine hard-won understandings among existing EU members.  In some
ways, it is hard to believe that environmental issues could play a
critical part in such weighty historical developments and, indeed, when
the crunch comes, they may be swept aside.  For the moment, however,
they seem likely to command a lot of attention.

GUIDANCE LIKELY IN THE SPRING

The guidance document due to elaborate on key contaminated land and
liability provisions in the Environment Act 1995 now seems likely to
emerge in draft for public comment around April (ELR028/3, 026/5, 025/3
et al).  No formal announcement has been made, but ELR understands that
a pre-publication draft is due to be circulated to selected experts and
interested groups in mid-February.  A meeting with a core group of
people has been arranged by the Department of the Environment (DoE) for
22 February, apparently to garner initial responses to that draft.  A
similar meeting was held in April 1995 at an earlier stage in the
policy debate to give the same people early warning of the Government's
then plans for guidance and amendments as the Environment Bill was
entering the House of Commons (ELR020/6).

Until recently, the main target date for the DoE has been to get the
package of guidance and regulations ready for submission to Parliament
before its summer recess.  Although ELR can only speculate at this
stage, it looks now as though that date could be hard to meet.  If a
public draft is put out for comment in April, there could be a
consultation period of about six to eight weeks, after which the
submissions will have to be digested and revisions made where
appropriate.  The DoE apparently kept open the option of seeking
further advice once the public responses were received from the
contractors it used at the end of last year (ELR026/5), although it may
not exercise that option.  The most likely date for a revised draft now
seems to be late-summer, early-autumn, perhaps October.  Hopefully,
that will go straight to Parliament for approval in a procedure that
can not take less than three weeks.  Some observers have suggested that
there might be a need for a further brief period for comment before
final submission to Parliament if substantial changes have been made in
the light of the responses in the spring.  The DoE will be hoping to
avoid that and, provided it does, the whole regime could come into
force around the beginning of 1997.

VENDORS & WASTE PRODUCERS AT RISK

The possible implications of the UK Government's new contaminated land
regime continue to be pored over in advance of the guidance documents
and regulations due out soon in draft to clarify important points in
Part II of the Environment Act 1995 (this issue above).  At a seminar
in London in January, convened by the Contaminated Land Working Party
of the UK Environmental Law Association, Richard Burnett-Hall, of
Bristows Cooke & Carpmael, London, warned that people selling
contaminated sites could be at risk of liability later on if the
purchaser or subsequent owners decided to change the site's use.  He
also argued that, although the UK Act does not name waste producers or
generators as primary responsible parties in the way that the US
Superfund law does, waste producers could nevertheless find themselves
drawn into the liability net as polluters.

Mr Burnett-Hall observed that a vendor who had warranted that a site
was clean for the purposes of a planned future use such as a car park
and had agreed a sale price with a purchaser under those conditions
might find that a subsequent change of use at the site re-opened the
question of responsibility for the remaining contaminants.  Under the
new regime, a site could be approved as satisfactory by the authorities
for the purposes of a specific intended use while a considerable amount
of residual contamination remained underground, contained against
further dispersion but neither removed nor eliminated.  That is the
core of the Government's "suitable for use" clean-up strategy, intended
to encourage the return to productive use of old industrial sites by
avoiding the excessive costs which would be incurred if all sites had
to be returned to a pristine condition.

Such partially cleaned sites would, however, be granted approval only
for restricted uses.  A plan to change their use to, say, a residential
development might cause them to be re-classified as contaminated and
trigger a whole new round of official remediation procedures.  At that
point, Mr Burnett-Hall told ELR, the regulator might deem the original
vendor an "appropriate person" for a remediation order or cost recovery
action on the grounds that he or she "caused" the offending substances
to be "in, on or under" the relevant land.  Unless the forthcoming
official guidance were specifically designed to avoid vendors being put
back on the hook once they had done what was required for the
originally intended use, he said, vendors would be well advised to seek
an indemnity from the purchaser covering all the contamination
remaining at the site.  Otherwise, the vendor's liability exposure
could remain open long after the site had passed out of his or her
control.

In relation to waste producers, Mr Burnett-Hall said that much would
depend on the meaning of "cause".  At present, there must be some
concern, he suggested, that a waste producer operating under the duty
of care imposed by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 might follow
his wastes all the way to a disposal site and even require that they be
deposited at a certain location within the site, remaining to check
that this was carried out, and then find later that the regulator
deemed such control to amount to causing contaminating substances to be
present in, on or under the land.  Again, Mr Burnett-Hall said that he
would like to see the guidance address this directly, specifying that
waste producers in such circumstances were not "appropriate persons".

Among other things, Mr Burnett-Hall also predicted that the forthcoming
guidance under the Act would be "seriously useful" compared with what
had existed hitherto and that the new land regime would be far more
effective in making things actually happen.  He said that it remained
open to question, however, how far local authorities would be competent
and willing to carry out the provisions, especially in relation people
operating in their areas.  He expected voluntary clean ups, where
operators chose to agree a plan with the regulators, often to go beyond
statutory requirements and not stop at just enough remedial action for
the next site use.  He also expressed concern about  the procedure for
apportioning liability, arguing that it would be difficult to define a
clear hierarchy of "appropriate persons" even in the guidance and that
one option would be to give local authorities discretion over whom to
name.  If that were adopted, he said, either there would be room for
appeal on the grounds that someone else should have been named as
responsible, in which case there was a risk of Superfund-style
litigation, or appeals would not be allowed and the process would be
seen as very unfair.

NEW MEMBERS WANT TOUGHER STANDARDS

With the approach of the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) to
decide the next steps towards integration of the European Union, no one
should be in any doubt that the arrival as EU members of Austria,
Finland and Sweden in 1995 has increased the pressure for tight
environmental regulation. Speakers from all three countries at a
conference in Vienna in November* emphasised the importance placed on
this by a broad cross-section of opinion in each and the overall effect
of this on the European Commission was confirmed by representatives of
the Commission's environment directorate general (DGXI).  To some
extent, this process has passed unnoticed in the rest of the EU up to
now, perhaps because of the low key role so far played by the new
members.

The IGC process may turn out to be the first widely visible platform
for this new pro-environment block, which is likely to support moves,
already backed by some existing member states, for more stringent
standards and greater use of qualified majority voting, rather than
unanimity, within the Council of Ministers on environmental matters.
Another opportunity will arise when an initial four-year transition
period for the new member states comes to an end.  During that period,
the accession treaty allows the new states to maintain standards which
are stricter than those within the rest of the EU and commits the
European Commission to conducting a review of EU standards in the hope
of raising them to the levels prevailing in the new states.  At the end
of the period, the intention is to have settled common standards across
all 15 member states, with the aim of setting them at the highest
possible level.

The new states clearly expect that to accommodate their own or higher
standards and are stating that, if such agreement has not been reached
by then, they will be very reluctant to reduce their standards into
line with those of less strict members.  The Commission, on the other
hand, is insisting that the accession treaty and the joint declarations
which went with it commit the EU only to a process of revision and not
to any definite result.  The new states will therefore have the chance
to press their case as full participants in an EU-wide discussion, but
the outcome can not be guaranteed.

Jose MartAEnez Aragon, of DGXI, told the conference nevertheless that
the arrival of the new member states had given new impetus to the EU's
environmental policy.  Among other things, it had allowed the EU to
take a more assertive position in international negotiations, such as
the Berlin climate change conference and the third meeting of the Basel
Convention (ELR025/8).  In an accompanying paper, Margaret Brusasco-
MacKenzie, the head of DGXI's international affairs unit, said that it
was already clear from the new states' role in recent environment
council meetings that their arrival, with a background of high
standards and high public awareness of environmental issues, would
"produce a Union with a far more ambitious approach".  When it comes to
the review under the transition arrangements, she said, "the question is
not whether the Union of fifteen can go hand-by- hand towards higher
standards, but rather the speed at which this is to be done."

Austria

Speakers at the conference* from Austria all stressed that
environmental concerns had figured high on the list of priorities
during the debate about joining the EU, with a majority of Austrians
concerned about any possible dilution of the country's stringent
regulations.  The agreement, known as the "horizontal solution", in the
accession treaty allowing Austria to maintain its own environmental
standards even where those exceed the EU equivalents, throughout the
four-year transition period, was seen as a key result of the
negotiations leading up to accession.  It is clear that the Austrian
Government, recently re-elected with a similar political complexion,
will fight hard at the end of that period to prevent any loosening of
standards and will lobby strongly for support in other member states .

Ingrid Thomasitz, of the Federal Environment Ministry, said that, in
the current review of the EU's Fifth Environmental Action Programme
(this issue p12), the Austrian Government would support a more robust
application of sustainability as a real test of policies in fields such
as transport, energy, agriculture and tourism, a restrictive
interpretation of subsidiarity so that it does not impede environmental
policies at EU level, and a further strengthening of the precautionary
and polluter pays principles, together with the integration of
environmental costs into the prices of goods and services.

At the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC), she said that Austria
would advocate: an obligation on the Commission to consider the
environmental effects or "ecological consequences", as well as the
budgetary ones, of every legislative proposal; simplification and
revision of the safeguard clause in Article 100(a)(4) of the Treaty to
make it a real "environmental guarantee", allowing member states "to
introduce stricter national standards as well as apply the existing
ones"; wider support for qualified majority voting and the joint
decision-making procedure under Art 189(b) of the Treaty, to enable
measures such as energy taxes to be imposed, although with limits in
relation to certain policy fields; other reforms to strengthen the role
of the European Parliament in EU decision-making; and greater
transparency in decision-making to aid public involvement.

Overall, Ms Thomasitz speculated that the presence of the three new
member states might at some stage lead to ecological criteria
comparable to the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union.
 Klemens Fischer, of Austria's Permanent Representation to the EU in
Brussels, told the conference that the acknowledgment given in Joint
Declarations 6 and 7 of Act of Accession to the new member states'
attachment to their existing environmental standards had been very
important to the voting within Austria on joining the EU.  He warned
that, if the Union had not reached common standards equivalent to those
prevailing in Austria by the end of the four-year transition period,
Austria would see no alternative to exercising its right to impose
national standards under Art 100(a)(4)  and, he said, the political
stakes would be too high for the European Commission to prevent that.

Frank Ceska, General Secretary of the Federation of Austrian
Industrialists, observed that an important part of the case presented
by opponents of joining the EU had been that it would deprive Austria
of its ability to pursue an independent, and stricter, environmental
regime.  He made clear that Austrian industry had rejected that view
and was gratified that the critics had been proved wrong, since none of
the country's stricter regulations had been changed since EU entry.  He
also drew attention to a pledge given by EU Environment Commissioner
Ritt Bjerregaard at a Council meeting in March 1995, that she did not
intend that any of the new member countries should be forced to change
their standards after the end of the transition period.

Given Austria's commitment to tight environmental rules, Mr Ceska
reported that industry favoured accelerated harmonisation of stricter
rules throughout the EU, rather than development of new rules in
Austria alone. In particular, he called for postponement of current
Justice Ministry proposals for a new environmental liability act in
Austria, based on the Council of Europe convention on civil liability
for damage resulting from activities that are dangerous to the
environment (the "Lugano" Convention).  This, he argued, would cause
"an enormous burden for industry and an unbearable distortion of
competition".  It would be much better, he said, to await forthcoming
European Commission proposals for an EU directive in this field.

Paul Luiki, of Heller, Lober, Bahn & Partners, Vienna, explained that
Austria had good reasons for sensitivity to environmental damage: it is
a small, land-locked country bordering on eight other countries, which
imports over 90% of its air pollution and a good deal of water
pollution through rivers such as the Danube, depends on groundwater for
99% of its drinking water, has an important tourist industry which
requires a clean environment and also poses risks to it, and has a
particular problem with ground-level ozone, with substantially higher
concentrations than elsewhere in Europe.  As a result, he said,
according to a 1991 OECD study Austria devoted a higher percentage of
its GDP to environmental protection, at 1.94%, than most other
industrialised countries, including Germany (1.74%), the Netherlands
(1.46%) and the US (1.36%).

Mr Luiki cautioned that comparisons of Austrian and EU environmental
standards could be over-simplified, since in some cases these were not
defined in comparable ways, and like Mr Ceska, he pointed to some areas
where EU membership had led Austria to introduce new rules, such as
environmental impact assessment and access to environmental
information.  He also noted that, in some fields such as wastewater
discharges, implementation of stricter Austrian standards left room for
improvement.  On the other hand, he said that Austria had given greater
priority than the EU to groundwater quality within its drinking water
policy.  A regulation under the country's Water Act, he told the
conference, required provincial governors to declare a groundwater
action area and to implement clean-up action where quality criteria
were exceeded.  He reported that the first such action was still
awaited, but he did not think it would be long before one occurred.  He
also pointed to associated regulations on storage of hazardous
materials, including one covering chlorinated solvents which involved
stringent emission and monitoring standards and for which there was as
yet no EU equivalent.

Ernst Brandl, of Schonherr Barfuss Torggler & Partner, Vienna,
highlighted the heavy reliance under Austrian law on "command and
control" mechanisms, at both federal and provincial levels.  Lengthy
permitting procedures, he said, usually allow everyone who might be
affected by a proposed development to participate and to appeal, with
the result that, for example, 12,000 people were involved in the
certification process of a garbage incineration plant in Vienna.  Most
provinces also have an "attorney for the environment" who has standing
in all provincial proceedings concerning activities which might have an
impact on the environment.

Finland/Sweden

Satu Nurmi, of the Finnish Permanent Representation to the EU, told the
conference* that Finland's geography presented special environmental
risks, with one-third of its territory above the Arctic Circle, a harsh
northern climate and natural resources which were vulnerable to
chemical precipitation.  "Even a small input of a hazardous substance,"
he said, "may cause impacts that are difficult if not impossible to
remedy simply because the natural renovation capacity of ecosystems is
very slow in northern latitudes."  He then listed a series of subjects
on which Finland had obtained special declarations and transitional
arrangements during the EU accession process, where it considered
present EU regulations insufficiently strict.  These included
transitional measures covering: pentachlorophenols (PCPs), fertilisers,
pesticides, sulphur content of liquid fuels and plant protection
products.

Like the Austrian speakers (this issue above), Mr Nurmi emphasised that
such environmental issues were given a high priority by the Finnish
public.  That was also echoed by Prof Hans Stenberg, of Advokatfirman
Lindahl, Stockholm, who said that this was one area in which the
Swedish Government could find common ground with a large part of the
Swedish population, the political parties and non-governmental
organisations (NGOs).  He reported that the Government had specified as
priorities in its approach to the EU's environmental agenda: measures
to combat acidification and climate change, resource management and
product recycling, conservation of biological diversity, more stringent
chemical control, international co-operation and more specific measures
including: environmental impact assessments, cleaner industrial
processes, waste disposal, environmental management and audits, trade,
energy-related taxes and land and water resource management.

More generally, Prof Stenberg said that the Swedish Government attached
much importance to implementation of rules once they were agreed.  That
went further than the basic question of correct implementation of
directives under member state law, he said; it also included allocation
of enough economic resources to the responsible bodies to ensure that
the rules are effectively observed.

LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE ACCESSION

Environmental issues could become a major obstacle to accession to the
European Union for the first time as the countries of central and east
Europe (CEE) prepare for this step following agreement on a broad pre-
accession strategy at the Essen European Council in December 1994.
Despite much rhetoric and optimism up to now, they still have a very
long way to go before they fulfil the environmental policy conditions
required for entry, according to a representative of the European
Commission.  Speaking at a conference in Vienna in November(this issue
above), Julian Wilson, of the PHARE Programme staff in DGIA, said that
while the Commission was working hard to support the countries' efforts
towards accession, there were some unrealistic expectations within the
CEE region, particularly in relation to the environmental conditions.
Among the problems experienced so far, he reported, were that the
dialogue with the EU on the issues involved was relatively superficial,
basic information and statistics were lacking, as were comprehensive
country strategies, financing plans and schedules did not exist,
legislation was being passed but not monitored or enforced, and the
environment was generally of secondary importance compared with
economic growth.

He warned that existing member states would not allow new entrants
unless the statutory targets on matters such as emissions were met and
the CEE region was mostly still a long way off that.  The European
Commission's environmental policy representatives were often seen as an
irritating obstacle by CEE government ministries, such as finance and
industry, he said, some of whom had to be convinced that environmental
requirements were unavoidable.  Mr Wilson described the progress which
had been made since the publication last summer of a White Paper on
preparation for integration into the internal market (COM(95) 163
final), on matters such as harmonisation of regulations, monitoring and
enforcement, municipalities, and past environmental damage and the
greening of industry.  He emphasised that the funds available through
the PHARE Programme and other international financial institutions
would amount to only a small proportion of the money required by the
CEE countries for approximation to EU environmental standards.

Mr Wilson made a number of forecasts on how things would develop in the
next few years, including that: CEE industry would remain uncontrolled
and very "ungreen" during the accession period; municipalities would
meet environmental conditions faster; the environment overall would
become a block to creation of a free market and to eventual accession;
the central part of the region had a head start, although the Baltic
states were catching up fast; the countries which costed the
environment fully, enforced more strongly and asked for acceptable
dispensations would accede first; and the present timeframes were
completely crazy.  The idea being promoted by some that the countries
would meet the objectives within five years was nonsense, he said;
progress could be made, however, if governments were prepared to
discuss specific derogations and enforcement matters.  The whole debate
in the environmental field, he argued, needed to be much more
structured, operational and realistic.  He also warned that this
process presented real dangers if it was not taken sufficiently
seriously, because a failure to achieve the EU's objectives in relation
to CEE countries could rebound on what had been achieved within the
existing EU membership.

Tim Murphy, head of the environmental appraisal unit at the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), London, also urged
sober assessment of the amounts of money needed to achieve
harmonisation with EU standards, pointing out that one estimate for all
six accession countries and three Baltic states was ECU100bn, or 3.6%
of gross domestic product (GDP) a year.  Another estimate given earlier
at the conference, of ECU300bn, would represent some 11% of GDP on
environmental affairs, he pointed out, which was clearly unrealistic.
He stressed that most of the finance for achieving environmentally
sustainable development would have to come from the countries
themselves and much of it from the private or municipal sectors.

Among the challenges facing the CEE countries, Mr Murphy said, were a
need to realise that they had to internalise environmental costs, a
need to embrace principles such as cleaner production and waste
minimisation, and the importance of environmental product standards.
He argued that it was particularly important to the EBRD that the
countries did not divide into two, with an advanced minority having
prospects of early accession and a less advanced majority falling
behind.  He also said that the investment cycle currently offered a
window of opportunity which had to be seized by the countries
themselves.

Gyula Bandi, of University Eotvos Lorand, Budapest, said that the
environment was still not a high priority issue for the Hungarian
Government, although he hoped that the introduction of Hungary's new
Environmental Protection Act (in force from December 1995) (ELR023/5,
020/7) might push it up the priority list.  Even the Act, he argued,
tended to allow economic considerations to override environmental
requirements, with concepts such as "if the present economic situation
allows" and a general lack of acceptance that there would be costs to
industry.  A key problem, he said, was there was still no core
programme or strategy, within which to order priorities and, in
addition, a recent resolution to restructure government
responsibilities had created uncertainty about who the competent
authorities for various environmental matters would be.

Stanislaw Wajda, an adviser to the Polish Environment Minister,
reported that the Polish Government was working on a framework law
which was launched in June last year, was due to be completed by June
1996 and should be sent to the country's Parliament by the end of 1997.
 He said that Poland faced problems such as a lack of legal expertise
and of analytical materials on EU laws, and was missing working
relations with EU experts and direct insight into the legislative
process within the EU.  He felt that observer status would be helpful
and he drew attention to a refusal of such status which had occurred in
1994 when Poland approached the EU's network of enforcement officials,
known as the Chester or IMPEL Network (ELR006/15, 005/15, 001/9). At
the time, the response had been that the request was premature, but he
argued that that ought to be re-considered.

EMERGING FROM SOVIET RULE

An important feature of the development of environmental law in the
Baltic states is that, unlike the countries of central Europe, they are
emerging from 50 years within the Soviet Union.  They have therefore
had to develop a whole framework of national law, as well as rules for
a market economy, since they obtained independence in 1991.  They
reached approximation agreements with the EU in 1995, so are very much
at the beginning of the process of adjusting their environmental laws
and regulations, the conference (this issue p7) was told by Gretta
Goldenman, of Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly, Brussels.

In Lithuania, she reported, a unit has been set up within the Ministry
of Environmental Protection to deal with the approximation process, but
the Ministry has access to very little expertise in environmental law
and would benefit greatly from closer contact with experts in more
advanced countries.  For that reason, she said, the Lithuanian
Government has recently been exploring close working ties with one or
more EU member states, to learn from their experience.  In the
meantime, a substantial amount of legislation is in draft, covering
subjects like environmental impact assessment and waste management, and
a framework law on environmental protection was passed in 1992.  An
environmental strategy was also recently prepared for submission to the
Sofia Environment for Europe conference last October (ELR025/6).

Legislators were having to struggle in this field, Ms Goldenman said,
with a background of Soviet regulations on subjects like ambient air
and water quality, which were so strict that they were virtually
unachievable.  The result in the past, she said, was that statutory
"maximum allowable pollution values" were routinely supplemented by
"temporary allowable pollution limits" issued by the authorities to
reflect what was actually being released by a plant.  Charges and
penalties for pollution were consequently very low, leaving almost no
incentive at all for enterprises to invest in pollution reduction.

One of the anomalies in Lithuania, and also in Latvia and Estonia, has
been that the privatisation process has up to now involved selling
enterprises separately from the land on which they stand, Ms Goldenman
told ELR.  This is because the country's Constitution limits ownership
of land to citizens of Lithuania and foreign embassies.  In order to
become members of the EU this has to be changed, she said, and a
Constitutional amendment partially removing that obstacle was being
debated in the Lithuanian Parliament in December.  An inter-ministerial
working group set up in April 1995, with some outside representation
from the business community, she reported, also produced
recommendations in September concerning liability issues in the
privatisation process, focussing particularly on damage which occurred
prior to privatisation, when the assets were under state ownership.
The Environmental Protection Ministry is currently considering those
recommendations.

WASTE OFFENCES BRING NEW LAW

A series of breaches of waste management authorisations recently
uncovered by environmental inspectors have persuaded the Slovak
Environment Ministry (MZPSR) to introduce new measures to tighten up
regulation in this field. The Ministry is currently preparing a new Law
on Wastes, part of which will include provisions to make it much more
difficult to "skirt round" the laws and regulations, according to a
statement from Environment Minister Josef Zlocha in January.  There
will also be encouragement for waste incineration as preferable to some
other forms of waste disposal.  Mr Zlocha emphasised that the danger
from wastes should not be under-estimated, because in the future they
could become an "ecological time bomb".

Two cases were cited by the Slovak News Agency in January.  The first
concerned a company called EHS, part of Slovnaft as, which had assumed
responsibility for handling certain hazardous wastes.  Instead of
disposing of them in the approved manner, the Ministry discovered
17,000 tonnes (t) of the waste in a brickworks yard in Lucenec, near
the Hungarian border, and 7,000t at a municipal waste site in Trencin,
north east of Bratislava. The second case involved Tellus Tellumo, in
Bratislava, which is alleged to have discharged used mineral oil
without due regard to its effects on groundwater and to have been
storing used batteries on site, with possible sulphuric acid leaks.
The company had a licence only to transport, rather than store, such
materials.  Local and national inspection officials were reported to
have exercised the appropriate sanctions in both cases.

PARLIAMENT RATIFIES BASEL

Bulgaria was added to the list of countries which have ratified the
Basel Convention on trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes and
their disposal, following a vote in its Parliament on 18 January.  In
supporting the vote, the Government observed that Bulgarian law in
recent years had been brought into line with the provisions of the
Convention.  The Environmental Protection Act passed in 1991 and
amended in 1992 regulates import and trans-shipment of waste, and is
backed up by foreign trade rules and agreements with the European
Union.  Bulgaria has also instituted an internal system for licensing
hazardous waste disposal.  The Environment Ministry reported that
Bulgarian industry generated 14,300 tonnes of hazardous waste in 1994.

BC PUBLISHES THIRD SITE DRAFT

Draft no 3 of the Contaminated Sites Regulation for the Canadian
province of British Columbia (BC) was finally published on 4 December.
This Regulation is required in order to implement a new contaminated
site regime under the Waste Management Amendment Act, 1993 (also known
as Bill 26), which was passed in June 1993 (ELR001/6).  The regime
involves strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability,
compulsory remediation orders, with exemptions for certain parties,
limited liability provisions for minor contributors and those
volunteering to conduct clean ups, allocation panels to assist in
apportioning liability, a public registry of site information and site
profile requirements at the time of specified transactions.  The system
has been criticised by some business groups, but has also been subject
to prolonged consultation.  The BC Government's view is that the new
provisions clarify issues which were left unresolved under previous
legislation and in so doing provide more defences and exemptions for
the parties likely to be involved.

Draft no 2 of the Regulation was circulated for comment in September
1994, following a consultation exercise, originally with the intention
that it should be the final draft prior to implementation and therefore
subject only to minor changes.  By October 1994, however, further
consultation had been extended indefinitely following pressure from
municipal authorities and subsequently other groups concerning clean-up
standards, municipal liability and liability exposures for parties such
as lenders, trustees, developers and the mining industry (ELR014/6,
012/4).  The third draft appeared to be imminent in July 1995
(ELR024/5, 022/6), but has ultimately taken until December to come out.
 This time comments were requested within seven weeks (by 22 January)
and the BC Government appeared to be resolved finally to push the
Regulation through.  The target date for its coming into force was
given as spring 1996.

The Regulation now contains some 17 Divisions (chapters) covering
subjects such as site profiles, site registry, fees, contaminated site
definition and determination, remediation standards, liability,
contaminated soil relocation, remediation plan approval and completion,
and orphan sites.  Most of the changes reflect the concerns which were
expressed about the second draft by various interested groups, so that
municipalities in particular get a series of clarifications or
concessions reducing their liability exposures, new exemptions are
provided for trustees, executors, administrators and other fiduciaries,
a lower standard of care for receivers and a new system of soil
standard setting is introduced containing four different types of
standards which are intended to allow more flexibility in the
remediation process.

REPORT HOLDS OMAI LIABLE FOR DAM

An inquiry report produced by a commission of the Guyanese Government
has suggested that the mine operators, Omai Gold Mines Ltd, should be
held liable for the damage which resulted from the failure of a
tailings dam at Guyana's largest gold mine in August last year
(ELR025/9, 024/19). The report concluded that the company had a legal
obligation to ensure that the cyanide-contaminated water in the
tailings pond did not escape and would be liable, irrespective of the
quality of their work in securing it, if the contaminants were allowed
to escape.  On the other hand, the report decided that the
contamination of the Omai and Essequibo rivers caused by the incident
did not give rise to a serious threat to life and that the natural
bacteriological and biochemical systems in the water courses did not
seem to have been severely affected.

In the underlying event, some 3m cubic metres of cyanide-contaminated
waste escaped from the tailings pond at Omai mine, first into the local
Omai river, but thereafter into Guyana's largest river, the Essequibo.
Initial concerns included possible threats to loggers, native Indians,
fish and wildlife along the river, which is much used for drinking
water and fishing.  Some neighbouring Caribbean countries at one stage
imposed bans on Guyana's fish and shrimp catch.  By mid-September,
however, the Guyanese Health Ministry had declared the Essequibo safe,
following international inspections.  Local inhabitants, nevertheless,
are reported to have complained of skin irritations and a coalition
group critical of the commission's report has been considering a class
action lawsuit, according to the Montreal Gazette.

Omai Gold Mines Ltd is 65% owned by Cambior Inc, Montreal, 30% by
Golden Star Resources Ltd, Edmonton (part of a Colorado-based US group)
and 5% by the Guyanese Government.  The mine is reportedly the largest
open pit gold mine in South America.  At the beginning of January,
Finance Minister Bharrat Jagdeo reported that the country's gold export
earnings were US$27m short of their $135m target in 1995 because of the
Omai mine's closure following the spill.  A separate estimate put
Omai's losses, in terms of expenses and lost revenue, at C$25m
(US$18.2m).  Cambior's share price also fell substantially following
the incident, with investors noting that the Omai mine had been due to
account for a sizeable part of the company's gold production in 1995.

The commission called for independent geo-technical scrutiny of a new
impoundment under construction at the mine, to confirm its structural
integrity.  It suggested that the spill was caused by faulty
construction of an embankment dam holding the liquid waste, resulting
in progressive cavities or tunnels in the core of the embankment which
ended in catastrophic failure.  Its report did not attempt to apportion
blame for the faults.

PARLIAMENT PRESSES FOR LIABILITY DIRECTIVE

Just when some observers thought that DGXI's efforts to get a draft
directive on environmental liability on to the books in 1996 were
running into difficulty (ELR028/9), the European Parliament has stepped
in to add a potentially important voice to the calls for such a
proposal.  At its plenary meeting in December, the Parliament approved
a resolution on the Commission's work programme for 1996 which includes
a demand that "a proposal for a directive concerning rules on damage to
the environment" be added to the programme.  When the 1996 work
programme was published in November, there was no mention of such an
initiative despite several indications during 1995 that DGXI hoped to
achieve this, if possible, in the early months of this year.

Efforts by DGXI to get approval for such a step from the College of
Commissioners, the forum which brings together all the European
Commissioners, at one of their meetings in December, were abandoned by
the middle of that month, apparently because the Environment
Commissioner, Ritt Bjerregaard, felt that the prospects of winning
agreement from her fellow Commissioners would be better after the
results were in from the two research projects into aspects of
environmental liability which are due for completion soon (ELR024/9,
022/8 et al).

What gives the Parliament's resolution some bite is that it draws
attention to its own previous resolution in April 1994 (ELR00/), which
called upon the Commission to bring forward proposals in this field,
and to the fact that the earlier resolution was passed by the
Parliament under Article 138b of the Treaty, which gives the Parliament
the power to initiate measures, rather than simply respond to the
Council and the Commission.  A separate clause in the December
resolution stresses that "the legislative programme should include
European Parliament initiatives adopted pursuant to Article 138b of the
EC Treaty".  The issue of environmental liability, whatever its
political complications, has therefore become embroiled in the
Parliament's battle to implement the enhanced powers it obtained under
the Maastricht treaty.  Other environmental measures mentioned in the
Parliament's December resolution included a proposal for "a directive
on soil protection laying down strict provisions on protection against
pollution and sustainable management of the soil (land use, erosion,
compaction)" and a "White Paper on the monitoring and application of
Community legislation on the environment, including the imposition of
penalties".

4TH INTERNATIONAL ENFORCEMENT CONFERENCE

The fourth in an increasingly important series of international
conferences on environmental compliance and enforcement will take place
on 22-26 April in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  Over 200 participants have
registered for this event, representing some 80 countries and
international organisations.  The previous conference was held in
Oaxaca, Mexico, in April 1994, attracting 175 people from 70 countries
(ELR012/8-11, 011/14, 006/15), and before that the first two in the
series took place in Utrecht, in May 1990, and Budapest, in September
1992 (ELR001/10).  Those two brought together representatives from 13
and 40 countries, respectively.  The series has been supported
throughout by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
Dutch Environment Ministry (VROM), together latterly with the UN
Environment Programme (UNEP), local agencies in the countries visited
and other groups.  There has been a deliberate attempt to spread the
activity geographically by convening each conference in a new region to
attract greater participation from that part of the world.

What distinguishes these mega-events from some other conferences is
that participation is confined for the most part to active national and
local officials with enforcement responsibilities, with a minority from
international agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).  The
flavour of the get-together is therefore very much about action and
building enforcement capabilities by sharing experience and extending
support across national boundaries.  In that sense, within Europe it is
parallelled by the, also increasingly important, Chester or IMPEL
Network, which brings together enforcement officials throughout the EU
on a regular basis (ELR006/15, 005/15, 001/9).

The conference programme in Chiang Mai includes workshop sessions with
subjects which give an indication of some of the current priorities.
They include, among others: establishing international co-operation and
regional networks, automation and enforcement, strategic targeting,
compliance monitoring, promoting voluntary compliance, measures of
success, public role in enforcement, criminal enforcement (Interpol
etc), economic instruments, take-back laws, transboundary illegal
shipments of hazardous waste (tricks of the trade) and collaborative
international targeting. While much of the work will focus on
institutional, technical and policy issues, it is worth noting that
involving the public in helping to enforce environmental regulations
remains very much on the agenda.  Workshop sessions on this public role
will include issues such as the role of citizens in identifying
violators, their role in pursuing enforcement actions or forcing
governments to pursue violators and the need for public disclosure of
compliance information.  Alongside this, considerable effort will be
put into assisting countries with less advanced environmental
regulatory capacities to increase their effectiveness.

EEA HIGHLIGHTS SOIL & GROUNDWATER

Soil and groundwater problems were among the topics highlighted by the
European Environment Agency (EEA) in a report published in November as
part of the European Commission's review of its Fifth Environmental
Action Programme.  The report was published just before the EEA
celebrated its second anniversary at its Copenhagen headquarters, an
occasion marked by a ceremony attended by 140 people, including the
Commission President Jacques Santer, Environment Commissioner Ritt
Bjerregaard and senior representatives from all 15 EU member states.

The EEA report concluded that EU environmental policy needed to be
"accelerated" in order to meet its own environmental objectives.
Although progress had been made in reducing some pressures on the
environment, these were not enough, it said, to improve the general
quality of the environment, even less to achieve sustainability.
Successes in recent years had been mainly in dealing with point (ie
stationary) sources of pollution, especially in the industrial sector.
Policies aimed at diffuse sources, such as products, consumers and
transport, it argued, had been much less effective.

The report recommended that further attention be given at European
level to climate change, acidification, urban air quality, water
abstraction and groundwater quality, habitat destruction and
fragmentation, and waste management.  It also identified as other
issues which had not been comprehensively tackled at European level the
degradation of soil quality (described as an important natural
resource), coastal management and chemicals in the environment.  Within
the 151-page report, the EEA suggested that more attention should be
given to the efficiency of environmental policies and called for a
particular focus on the transport sector, where it foresaw exceptional
pressures on the environment as a result of growth trends in freight
and passenger road transport.

Mr Santer told the Agency's anniversary gathering that he wanted the
Commission to be "at the leading edge of environmental policies" and
that he saw the EEA's work in developing accurate data on environmental
trends as part of a drive to change attitudes across Europe.  Ms
Bjerregaard said that the issues identified in the EEA report would be
taken up in the Commission's own proposals for advancing the 5th Action
Programme.  She drew attention to the fact that moves towards greater
use of economic instruments in this field were being hampered by the
requirement for unanimity at the Council of Ministers on policies with
fiscal provisions and she observed that the unanimity requirement might
be reconsidered during the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC)
(this issue p4).

EEA INTERNET SITE LAUNCHED

A European Environment Agency (EEA) Internet site was launched by
European Commission President Jacques Santer at the Agency's second
anniversary celebrations on 13 November.  The World Wide Web site, at
http://www.eea.dk/, is intended to play a key role in making EEA
information available to the general public.  The initial contents will
be relatively limited, but there are plans to add more publications and
many EEA databases, with the newest items advertised at the main home
page of the site.  Within the first month after its launch, the EEA
reported that there had been 1,800 accesses to the home page and a
total of over 30,000 file retrievals from the whole site.

REFINERY FINED RECORD S$150,000

A S$150,000 (US$105,783) fine imposed by the Port of Singapore
Authority against the Singapore Refinery Co in connection with an oil
spill at its Pulau Merlimau refinery last August is the highest so far
imposed in Singapore for an oil spill.  The penalty was imposed under
the Prevention of Pollution at Sea Act, which provides for fines up to
S$500,000 and prison terms of up to two years.  Previously, the highest
fine for this kind of incident had been S$30,000.

The August spill is reported to have resulted from a pipeline valve
being accidentally left open following maintenance activities.  Some
300 tonnes of oil subsequently leaked into the sea when pumping
restarted.  The oil apparently leaked into an adjoining drain and
thence into the storm water system and the sea.  It then spread over an
area of approximately 60 sq km and is said to have cost S$1.7m to clean
up.  A further S$6,000 in fines had previously been levied under the
Trade Effluents Regulations.

The company, a joint venture involving Caltex, BP and Singapore
Petroleum Ltd, had sought a lesser penalty on the grounds that it had
co-operated fully once the leak was detected and had done its utmost to
clean up the damage.  Since the incident, it told The Straits Times, it
had revised operating procedures, improved storm water inspection
before it enters the sea, installed guard basins and oil detection
devices, provided additional training for staff, and reviewed emergency
response systems, organising an external audit to verify the
improvements.  A spokesman told the paper that the company was ISO

of the inquiries conducted after the spill.

NEW EPA AUDITING/SELF-REPORTING POLICY

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a new policy
concerning environmental auditing and reporting of statutory
violations, which offers some incentives to companies to report
themselves when they discover such infractions, but also leaves
question marks about the advisability of doing so.  The policy
statement, "Incentives for Self- Policing: Discovery, Disclosure,
Correction and Prevention of Violations", was published in the Federal
Register on 22 December and came into effect on 22 January.  It is the
culmination of a period of consultation about this subject which began
in the summer of 1994 (ELR020/11, 013/11).

Hitherto, official guidance has been based on a series of policy
statements issued by the EPA and the Department of Justice from 1986
onwards, which stated that the regulators would not routinely seek
companies' audit reports in the course of their enforcement work and
that activities such as self-auditing and voluntary disclosure would be
taken into account in decisions about prosecutions and penalties.  The
underlying policy, however, reserved for the authorities the discretion
to demand such reports when they deemed it appropriate and was the
subject of much corporate concern because of the uncertainty which this
caused.

In recent years, business groups have been arguing in favour of a new
form of legal privilege to protect such internal review documents,
widely known as the "self-evaluative" privilege.  Several US states
have introduced such a concept at state level and there is case law
supporting it in private civil actions relating to fields such as
medical malpractice, but it is not recognised so far in the federal, or
many of the state, courts in the context of environmental actions.  The
EPA announced in March 1995 that it would not support a new statutory
audit privilege in this field, for fear that that could "promote
secrecy, expand litigation and compromise enforcement actions".  During
the consultation process, environmental groups had lobbied the Agency
for total transparency of the audit process, with public participation
and disclosure throughout.  Companies, in contrast, tend to feel that
more is achieved in terms of environmental protection if audit reports
remain internal.

What the EPA decided to offer instead was a policy of reduced civil
penalties and waiving of criminal proceedings where organisations
disclosed their own violations and promptly corrected them.  The
discretion to ask for audit material would remain, but would only be
exercised where there was independent evidence of a potential
violation.  The incentive system now coming into effect specifies
conditions under which the "gravity-based" component of a civil penalty
can be reduced by either 100% or 75%.  Such civil penalties are
assessed in two parts: first, in terms of the net economic benefit
which the company concerned is deemed to have gained as a result of
violating certain regulations and, second, a "gravity-based" element
intended to reflect the degree of seriousness involved.  The first will
continue to be imposed in full under the new policy, but the second may
be reduced or eliminated where companies meet specified standards.

A recent briefing put out by the Washington DC office of lawyers
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, gives a good summary of the new policy's
provisions.  To secure a 100% reduction of the gravity-based penalty,
nine conditions have to be met: the violation must be discovered
through an environmental audit or "due diligence" compliance programme;
it must be identified voluntarily; it must be fully disclosed to the
EPA within 10 days of discovery; it must be discovered and disclosed
independent of any government, third party or "whistleblower" action;
it must be corrected within 60 days, or longer with EPA agreement, with
correction certified to the EPA; the company must agree to take steps
to prevent a recurrence; the violation must not be a repeat of a
previous violation; it must not have caused "serious actual harm" nor
presented "an imminent and substantial endangerment" nor violated the
terms of a previous order or consent decree; and the company must co-
operate with the EPA's investigation of the matter.  Morgan, Lewis &
Bockius point out that this will allow companies to benefit from the
penalty reduction even where the violation is of a kind that is subject
to mandatory reporting.

The policy then gives a detailed definition of environmental due
diligence sufficient to achieve the reduction, based on the company's
systematic efforts, appropriate to the size of the business, to
prevent, detect and correct violations through all of a six-point list
of measures.  It also offers more limited 75% reductions where the
company does not have an audit or due diligence programme meeting the
EPA criteria, but fulfils all the other conditions on the nine-point
list.

Alex Karlin, of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, told ELR that the EPA was
effectively offering companies a carrot to encourage voluntary
disclosure where no mandatory duty to disclose existed.  He cautioned,
however, that companies would have to look carefully at each case and
decide whether it was better to come forward and accept a high
probability of a penalty, albeit reduced, or not to report in the
knowledge that no one might ever find out or, if they did some years in
the future, the problem would already have been fixed.  Under the
latter circumstances, he said, the only thing missing would have been a
voluntary report to the authorities, who might by that time take the
view that it was not worth re-opening penalty proceedings.  The
decision, he suggested, would be fact-specific, based on the nature of
the violation and the likelihood of it coming out anyway.

The most important pre-requisite, Mr Karlin emphasised, was to fix the
problem immediately or as soon as possible.  Having done that, he
argued, the self-reporting question would become a smaller issue.  He
noted, nevertheless, that the "gravity-based" element in a penalty
assessed by the EPA could be as large as $1.4m or $2m, so the
reductions on offer could not be dismissed.  He also said that existing
company audit or compliance programmes ought now to be checked against
the new EPA definitions to make sure that they would qualify for
reductions under the scheme.

ACCOUNTING FORUM ADVISES ON REPORTING

Pressure for fuller reporting of environmental factors by companies
received a further boost in December, when a potentially influential
advisory document on the best ways to treat environmental expenditures
and liabilities in company accounts and annual reports within the
European Union was produced by an expert body known as the Accounting
Advisory Forum.  The Forum comprises individual experts selected on a
personal basis to advise the European Commission on accountancy
matters.  It is not a standard-setting body.  The document, entitled
"Environmental Issues in Financial Reporting", is therefore intended to
stimulate discussion on the issues among "standard-setters, preparers,
users and auditors of accounts" in member states.

The subject was raised in the Commission's Fifth Environmental Action
Programme, "Towards Sustainability", published in 1992, and the Forum
was asked by the Commission to give an opinion on how to improve
reporting in this field, "so that a better insight is provided into the
company's attitude towards the environment and the impact of
environmental risks and liabilities on its financial position."  The
document is not concerned with separate environmental reports produced
by companies, except insofar as it recommends that the existence of
these should be referred to in accounts and annual reports as a source
of further information.

Using the framework of general provisions in the 4th and 7th Company
Law Directives on annual and consolidated accounts (78/660/EEC and
83/349/EEC), the document acknowledges that environmental liabilities
and risks entail special uncertainties relating to factors such as
changes in clean-up technologies, future legislation and the extent or
nature of the clean up required.  Nevertheless, it argues that such
liabilities and risks qualify for recognition as a provision in the
balance sheet if the company has a legal or contractual obligation to
prevent, reduce or repair environmental damage, or if its management is
committed to such action through things like statements of policy or
intention, industry practice or public expectations, or communication
of such a decision either internally or externally.

The amount of a provision, it suggests, should be based on reasonable
estimates of the loss, if necessary within a range, with a contingent
liability note where it is possible that the loss will be greater than
expected.  If no reasonable estimate can be made, which the document
describes as "rare circumstances", "the company should at least
disclose the nature of the contingent liability as well as the
circumstances and risks involved in the notes to the accounts."  The
amount recorded as a company's expected future environmental
expenditures should, the document says, be sufficient "to cover the
full costs of the damage to the environment for which the company is
responsible, irrespective of the date at which the activity is ceased."

Except where long-term de-commissioning costs for such facilities as
drilling platforms or nuclear power stations can be clearly
distinguished from other liability provisions, the Forum interprets the
4th Directive as requiring that the full charge should be included in
the profit and loss account as soon as it arises, and not spread over
several years.  This is despite the fact that the Forum recognises that
new legislation or discovery of unexpected liabilities may involve
accumulated expenditures which are so large that they distort the
company's accounts in that year, making it difficult to interpret its
underlying economic performance.

The document defines criteria for capitalising environmental
expenditures and it recommends more generally that gross liabilities
and expected recoveries, through counter-claims, insurance cover or
similar agreements, be shown separately in the balance sheet, rather
than presenting liabilities in net form.  In terms of disclosure, the
document says that environmental issues should only be disclosed in
accounts and annual reports "to the extent that they are material to
the financial performance or financial position of the undertaking",
with exemptions where member states have introduced them for small and
medium-size companies.

It suggests that the notes on the accounts should include the amount
capitalised and analysis of the amount charged to the profit and loss
account "in a manner appropriate to the nature and size of business
and/or the types of environmental issues relevant to the enterprise",
including factors as prevention, reduction and repair of environmental
damage.  The notes should also, it states, cover costs incurred as
fines or penalties for non-compliance and compensation to third parties
for loss or injury (which the Forum excludes from its "narrow"
definition of environmental expenditures).  In the annual report, the
Forum argues, information could include a description of the issues
which are relevant to the financial position and the undertaking's
response to them, the enterprise's environmental policy, improvements
that have been made in key areas, available government incentives, the
extent of measures which are in the process of implementation and a
reference to any other information provided in a separate environmental
report.

GUARANTEE REQUIREMENTS POSTPONED

A Decree issued at the beginning of January has postponed the deadlines
previously set for operators of certain high risk installations in
France to obtain financial guarantees to cover factors such as accident
and pollution response measures, site restoration after closure and
site monitoring and security.  The deadline for such guarantees had
been 13 December 1995, but the French Environment Ministry announced
shortly before that that implementation would be delayed.  Under Decree
no 96-18 of 5 January 1996, the guarantee requirements are still
brought into effect from 14 December 1995 for all new waste storage
facilities and mining operations (ie, those whose initial authorisation
is after that date), but the deadline for such sites which were already
in operation is postponed until 14 June 1999.  New industrial
facilities will have until 14 December 1997 to obtain such guarantees,
while it appears that no date has been set for existing industrial
facilities.

These provisions come under Article 23 of the 1976 Classified
Installations Law, as amended by Decree no 94-848 of 9 June 1994
(ELR011/3).  The 1994 Decree specified elements of the different
categories of installation which had to be covered, required all
guarantees to be renewed at least three months before their expiry and
tied them to particular operators, so that any change of ownership or
control would require a new guarantee.  Patrick Thieffry, of Thieffry &
Associes, Paris, told a conference in Vienna in November (this issue
p7) that the reason for delay was that qualifying financial securities
were generally not available in France as yet from banks or insurers
and no alternative fund had been established, as permitted under the
law.  A few such guarantees had been issued, he said, but only on a
case-by-case basis and at a local level.

Mr Thieffry placed all this in the context of increasingly tight
policing of the so-called classified installations, which include a
large number of relatively high risk plants in France.  He referred to
case law under the 1976 Law which showed that French courts will uphold
orders against current operators requiring them to restore a site to
"such a condition that it presents none of the hazards or
inconveniences" which the law seeks to eliminate.  He observed that
this responsibility was irrespective of whether the operator was in
charge of the site at the time that the relevant pollution occurred and
that the requirement extended to events occurring before 1976, with the
Conseil d'Etat linking it to a prior 1917 Law on Classified
Installations.

Mr Thieffry cited as an example the case of a Marrion Merrel Dow site
in Yvelines, where the company was having to conduct a major clean-up
operation even though it only acquired the site in 1981 while the toxic
chemicals involved had been dumped between 1965 and 1969.  In that
case, over 80 tonnes of various toxic chemicals, 300 tonnes of acetic
acid and 650 tonnes of alcohol had been deposited in a basin, from
which it had leaked into chalky soil and spread, with a vulnerable
water course nearby. ELR understands that the pollution only came to
light when Marrion Merrel Dow was in the process of selling the site to
a new owner in 1992 and resulted in the contaminated part of the site
having to be withdrawn from the sale, pending satisfactory clean up.
The operation is expected to last seven years and to include 15
drilling operations to divert the flow of pollutants away from the
perimeter and removal of some 2,500 tonnes of contaminated soil, Mr
Thieffry said.

ISO PUBLISHES SUPERFUND REPORT

The US Insurance Services Office (ISO), New York, an industry body
serving the property/casualty insurance industry, has published a
report* on the Superfund hazardous substance clean-up law, which is
currently subject to Congressional attempts at reform (ELR027/3, 026/1
& 3, et al).  The report, entitled "Superfund and the Insurance Issues
Surrounding Abandoned Hazardous Waste Sites" was published on 29
December.  It gives a range of estimates for the long-term costs to
insurers from such waste sites, based on previous studies, of between
$25bn and $608bn, although it notes that most recent estimates are at
the low end of the range and that discounting for net present value
would substantially reduce the numbers.  It places these figures
alongside the total US property/casualty insurance industry's statutory
surplus at the end of 1994 of $191bn, but it notes that a small number
of large writers of commercial liability insurance are likely to bear
most of the cost.  The combined surplus of the 35 most exposed to these
losses stood at $85bn.

The report highlights as prime insurer concerns about Superfund:
adverse court decisions which find unintended cover in old insurance
policies, difficulty in establishing plausible estimates of liabilities
and reserves due to conflicting court rulings and other factors, unfair
cost allocation among potentially responsible parties (PRPs) and their
insurers, and high litigation costs related to coverage disputes and
policyholder defence.  It cites a number of studies into transaction
costs in the Superfund process, including legal costs, and highlights a
1994 Government Accounting Office GAO survey which found that such
costs represented approximately one-third of PRPs' costs and an A M
Best study in the same year which estimated the insurance industry's
litigation cost share at 45%.

The report reviews the range of reform options currently on the
political agenda, focussing particularly on elimination of retroactive
liability and joint and several liability, revision of clean-up
standards and remedy selection, and delegation of clean-up authority to
the states.  It concludes that many of the proposed reforms would
reduce environmental liabilities for industry and for insurers, but
many could also increase expenses for the federal government.  In that
context, it notes that the potential payers of the taxes which the
government would be likely to raise to meet those costs, especially the
petroleum, chemical and insurance industries, disagree on the best
approach.  Overall, the report suggests that Superfund and clean up of
hazardous waste will continue to be difficult issues for insurers,
public policy-makers and society as a whole, and that the size of the
required clean up and the question of who should pay will remain the
focus of debate for many years to come.

Waste Sites", available from the Insurance Services Office Inc, 7 World

SPATE OF OIL/CHEMICAL SPILLS

Anyone taking a snapshot of recent events in Russia could be forgiven
for thinking that something close to an epidemic of oil spills and
other leaks was taking place.  The incidents have been of varying sizes
and the overall significance of them is hard to gauge.  Nevertheless,
there seems little doubt that the general condition of the pipeline
system falls well short of what would be required in most OECD
countries and reports from depots elsewhere in Russia and the former
Soviet bloc suggest a routine disregard in the past for basic
environmental standards during operations such as oil delivery at rail
terminals and refineries.

The most serious spill in recent weeks seems to have been one in
December in the republic of Bashkortostan, at the southern end of the
Urals, where a 700mm oil pipeline, more than 30 years old and running
along the bottom of the river Belaya, was found to have burst on 26
December near the capital city of Ufa, south-west of Sverdlovsk.
Initial reports indicated that a 100 tonne (t) oil slick was presenting
difficulties because of severe weather conditions which were preventing
the use of specialised recovery equipment and even attempts to burn off
the oil.  According to news agency reports in early January, oil was by
then being removed by means of buckets through holes in the ice which
covered the river.  Only some 15t had been recovered a week after the
incident and there were fears that the oil might eventually reach the
Kama river and ultimately the Volga and the Caspian Sea.  Emergency
services were reported to be building a protective shield near
Blagoveshchensk, 40km downstream from Ufa, to try to stop that
happening and both Bashkortostan and neighbouring Tatarstan had issued
pollution warnings.

A few days later, however, the Bashkortostan Environment Minister,
Rustem Khamitov, declared that the pipeline's owner had "seriously
violated the truth" in saying that 100t of oil had been lost; the
reality was that a much larger quantity had escaped, he said, and the
crucial objective was to recover and neutralise as much as possible
before the spring thaw in 50-70 days time.  According to Reuters, the
state pipeline monopoly Transneft had declared two days after the
incident that the leak had been dealt with, but Tass was now reporting
that 160 workers were still struggling to control the leak.  The pipe
had apparently been shut off, booms put across the river and the oil
set on fire to stop it spreading.  Some 664t of oil and water were said
to have been collected, of which up to 15% was oil.  At the same time,
oil was reported to have reached Tatarstan, 160km from Ufa.

By mid-January, weak ice on the river was forcing the authorities to
resort to wider oil burning, leading Mr Khamitov to go on television to
reassure people whose homes were being "covered with smoke" as the fire
spread over a large area.  The pipeline company was by then claiming
that 468t of oil had escaped, but other estimates put the figure at up
to 2,400t.  On the other hand, according to Trud newspaper, pollution
readings in the Belaya which showed concentrations of petroleum
products five times maximum permissible levels had to be put in the
context of routine chemical contamination of the river and common
background levels of petroleum products of 2-3 times the official
limits in winter and up to 10 times in summer.  A Greenpeace
representative claimed that leaks from Russia's ageing pipeline network
were so routine now that they resulted in the loss of between 2% and
10% of the country's oil each year, representing total leaks of 20-50
million tonnes (mt) a year.

On 26 January, a Tatarstan environment official told a press conference
in Kazan that, extrapolating from the concentrations reaching the Tatar
town of Aktanysh, it appeared that 12,000-13,000t of oil must have
leaked into the Belaya.  The Interfax news agency was quoted as saying
that divers had still not located the precise point of the leak because
of silting in the river and were therefore raising the pipe to the
surface for inspection.  Meanwhile, some 150km upstream of the Ufa oil
spill, a serious leak of phenol occurred on 19 January at the Salavat
oil refinery, involving the loss of around 2 cubic metres of this toxic
substance.  The spill was initially turning into a snow-like solid in
the severe frost and efforts were being made to recover it in that
condition before a thaw allowed it to dissipate into the Belaya.

In the same month that all this was going on, a number of other serious
incidents were also reported.  On 24 December, some 400t of oil leaked
from the Ukhta-Yaroslavl pipeline in the northern Komi republic,
although the plume from this seemed to have been contained within an
area of around 5,000 square metres.  On 16 January, a second spill was
discovered in the same pipeline, this time near the town of Kotlas, in
Archangel region. Some 70t of oil were reported to have escaped, but it
appeared that none had reached the Severnaya Dvina river and work was
progressing to collect and burn it off.  On 11 January, a bulldozer
breached part of Surgut-Polotsk pipeline in the Perm region,
immediately north of Bashkortostan, releasing according to one estimate
242t of oil.  On 16 January, it was reported that a slick extending
over 2.5km had been discovered on the Syzranka river in Samara region,
west of Tatarstan.  This seemed to have leaked from an underwater
stretch of the Syzran-Zolnoye pipeline, possibly as a result of
corrosion. The total quantity of oil leaked was not known, but again
the huge river Volga was threatened as the slick occurred only 8km from
the meeting of the two rivers.

The Baltic republic of Latvia has also been experiencing some similar
problems.  In November, 100t of diesel escaped from a pipeline linking
central Russia with the Latvian port of Ventspils, apparently the
result of a breach made by thieves some 12km east of Ventspils.  A
senior Latvian official called for a return to regular inspection of
his country's pipelines, which he said had been left without any
supervision and had become an easy target for petroleum thieves who
damaged the pipelines.  On 16 January, a leak of petroleum products
from a wharf in Ventspils was reported to have reached the Baltic.

WASTE TREATMENT DISPUTE

A plan by the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) to provide
mobile waste treatment units at all the country's industrial estates is
reported to have running into difficulty as a result of a previous
government contract with a Thai-US joint venture, Genco, to build
Thailand's first modern hazardous waste facility in Rayong province.
That contract gave Genco the sole right to operate hazardous waste
plants, according to FT Water Briefing.  Genco had planned to have its
plant up and running by early 1996, but had to stop work late last year
in the face of opposition from local residents who fear pollution to
local streams.  A government-run treatment plant in Bankhunthien has
been working at only 10% of its 110,000 tonne capacity, apparently
because the majority of factories evade laws requiring treatment of all
toxic waste and pay for illegal dumping.  An estimated 1m tonnes of
toxic waste is produced each year in Thailand.

ASSESSMENT OF THE LOSS AND DEGRADATION OF ECOSYSTEMS IN
THE U.S.

This (National Biological Service) report: presents
estimates of declines of natural ecosystems in the
U.S.; provides a rationale for ecosystem-level
conservation; discusses decline and threat as criteria
for conservation; and relates ecosystem losses to
endangerment at species and population levels.  It
suggests that integrated conservation plans be
developed for all ecosystems in each ecoregion of the
U.S., starting with types and regions that sustained
the greatest losses and are at greatest risk of further
loss.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION IN THE U.S.

At its core, environmental restoration -- defined as
the cleanup of contaminants from past activities --
depends on a series of decisions about the nature and
extent of contamination, the risk to human health and
the environment, and the potential effectiveness of
remediation techniques and technologies to reduce the
risk to acceptable levels.  The effectiveness with
which these decisions are made has significant impact
on the cost and duration of the cleanup efforts.  The
decisions must often be made on the basis of incomplete
and uncertain data.  Emerging environmental information
and data acquisition technologies, together with
appropriate strategies to support decision-making, are
beginning to change the way environmental restoration
occurs in the U.S.

Past environmental restoration activities too often
relied on prescriptive data collection activities to
generate the information upon which decisions were
made.  Retrospective studies of such activities show
that often data were gathered for the purpose of
reducing the risk in decision-making, but little true
reduction in risk was realized and large amounts of
resources were consumed.  Recent examination of the
failures in the U.S. to achieve many complete cleanups,
despite the investment of large sums and time, points
to the inability to have decisions made efficiently.

The solution to the problem involves both regulatory
change to allow more flexibility in decision-making and
the introduction of technology to improve
decision-making.  This (Argonne National Laboratory)
paper reviews recent assessments made of cleanup
processes and the application of strategies and
technologies to enhance decision-making for cleanup.
It provides examples of the decision-making approaches
and the technologies that have been employed to speed
up characterization and to optimize the implementation
of remediation.

PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

From the ozone hole and the greenhouse effect, to
plastics recycling and hazardous waste disposal,
society faces a number of issues requiring an
unprecedented understanding of the properties of
molecules.  We are coming to realize that the
environment is a coupled set of chemical systems.  Its
dynamics determine the welfare of the biosphere and of
humans in particular.  These chemical systems are
governed by fundamental molecular interactions, and
they present chemists with an unparalleled challenge.
The application of current concepts of molecular
behavior and of up-to-date experimental and
computational techniques can provide us with
environmental insights needed to: mitigate past damage;
anticipate the impact of current human activity; and
avoid future insults to the environment.

Environmental chemistry encompasses a number of
separate, yet interlocking, areas of research.  In all
of these areas, progress is limited by an inadequate
understanding of the underlying chemical processes
involved.  Participation of all chemical approaches
(experimental, theoretical, and computational) and of
all disciplines of chemistry (organic, inorganic,
physical, analytical, and biochemistry) will be
required to provide the necessary fundamental
understanding.  This (Battelle Pacific Northwest
Laboratories) paper discusses physical chemistry and
the environment.

JUDGING THE HEALTH RISKS OF ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES

This (Brookhaven National Laboratory) report provides
perspective on the various risks to which man is
routinely exposed.  It serves as a basis for
understanding the meaning of quantitative risk
estimates and for comparing new or newly-discovered
risks with other better-understood risks.  Specific
emphasis is placed on the health risks of energy
technologies.  The report is not a risk assessment, nor
does it contain instructions on how to do a risk
assessment; rather, it provides background information
on how most of us think about risks and why it is
difficult to do it rationally.  It provides a
philosophy and data to use to do a better job of
judging risks more rationally.  It also provides an
overview of where the risks of energy technologies fit
within the spectrum of all risks.  Much of the
quantitative information provided is on the relative
risk of dying of various causes.  This is not because
the risk of dying is seen as the most important kind of
risk, but because the statistics on mortality rates by
cause are the highest-quality data available on health
risks in the general population.  (Although the report
is dated Sep. 1992, it was revised in May 1994.)

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES USING LIDAR

This translation of a Doctoral thesis from Sweden (Lund
University) concerns the application of lidar
techniques in environmental studies.  Lidar
measurements are performed with a mobile lidar system,
based on a Nd:YAG-pumped dye laser, to measure mercury
fluxes on emissions from chlor-alkali plants in Sweden
and Italy.  An Italian cinnabar mining area (where
mining activities stopped in 1982) is mapped, and high
fluxes of atomic mercury vapor are detected.
Comparative measurements are also made using a
conventional gold-amalgamation-point monitor.

Plumes from geothermal plants in Italy are also
monitored, and it is found that the amount of mercury
emitted is much higher than expected.  Lidar
measurements are also performed on the gas plumes
emerging from the Italian volcanoes Etna, Stromboli,
and Vulcano, using a lidar system on a ship that made
traverses under the plumes.

A vertically-sounding ozone lidar system for
tropospheric measurements has also been constructed,
based on a KrF excimer laser whose output is
Raman-shifted in hydrogen to obtain wavelengths of  277
and 313 nm.  Comparisons with two other ozone
monitoring systems -- a ND:YAG/dye laser based the
lidar system, and a differential absorption optical
system (DOAS) -- are carried out.  The mobile lidar
system is integrated with a spectrally-resolving
optical multi-channel system and a multi-color imaging
system, to remotely detect fluorescence from vegetation
and water.  It is found that the fluorescence spectra
from vegetation exposed to environmental stress are
different from the spectra detected from control
vegetation.  Fluorescence images are recorded from
distances up to 100 m.  The thesis contains
157 references and 15 figures.

CARBON MONOXIDE EXPOSURES INSIDE OF AUTOMOBILES

This (EPA) paper deals with carbon monoxide (CO)
exposures measured inside a motor vehicle during
88 standardized drives on a major urban arterial
highway (El Camino Real) having a traffic volume of
30,500-45,000 vehicles per day, over a 13-1/2 month
period.  For the 88 trips, the mean CO concentration
was 9.8 ppm, with a standard deviation of 5.8 ppm.  A
fairly-strong seasonal trend exists for the co-variates
that were examined: ambient CO at 2 fixed stations;
atmospheric stability; seasonal trend function; time of
day; average surrounding vehicle count; trip duration;
proportion of time stopped at lights; and instrument
type.  A model consisting of only a single measure of
traffic volume and a seasonal trend component, has
substantial predictive power; by contrast, the ambient
CO levels, although partially correlated with average
exposures, contributed comparatively little predictive
power to the model.  The study shows that: (1) the mass
balance equation can relate exterior CO concentrations
as a function of time, to interior CO concentrations;
(2) CO exposures on urban arterial highways vary with
season; (3) momentary CO experienced behind red lights
vary with the intersection; and (4) an averaging-time
model can simulate exposures during short trips
(20 minutes or less) on urban arterial highways.

USING GAS REBURNING TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE ATMOSPHERIC
NOx EMISSIONS FROM FURNACES AND KILNS

This (Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc.) report
analyzes a number of industrial processes and assesses
the suitability of using natural gas reburning
technology to achieve reduced NOx emissions.  In gas
reburning, a small amount of gas -- typically 10-15% of
the total fuel input -- is injected above the primary
fuel zone to create a fuel-rich reburn zone where NOx
is reduced.  Gas reburning has the capability to reduce
NOx emissions by 50-65%, but its use in particular
applications is dependent on specific process and
combustion parameters.  The report identifies five
industrial processes as being suitable for natural gas
reburning: glass melting furnaces; cement kilns; reheat
furnaces; process heaters; and waste-heat recovery
systems.

PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN FOODS: A DATABASE FOR COMPUTERS

This (FDA) database, consisting of three 3-1/2 inch DOS
diskettes, provides comprehensive information on the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration's monitoring,
coverage, and findings of pesticide residues in foods
under the regulatory monitoring (i.e., tolerance
enforcement) component of the FDA pesticide program for
FY 1993.  It covers domestically produced and imported
foods representing about 100 countries.  The database
contains three sections.  The first section is a large
detailed data file that presents FDA pesticide
monitoring coverage and findings by country/food
product/pesticide combination.  The other two sections
are smaller summary files that provide an overview by
country/pesticide combination without regard to
pesticide, and by country/pesticide combination without
regard to product.  They are accompanied by a search
program and report formats that enable users to perform
simple searches and generate reports.  The raw data by
individual sample, from which the three files are
compiled, are also provided.  The diskettes contain
text only; users must provide their own search and
retrieval software.  They are formatted in Dbase III
Plus.  Memory requirement is 640 K, and an IBM

REMOVING PCBs FROM CONTAMINATED SOIL USING THE CF
SYSTEM(tm) SOLVENT EXTRACTION PROCESS

This (Science Applications International Corp.) report
covers a treatability study of the removal of PCBs from
contaminated soil using the CF System(tm) Solvent
Extraction Process.  Soil samples were obtained from
the Springfield Township Superfund Site, Davisburg
Michigan, taken from a specific area of that site
known to have some of the highest concentrations of
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  The samples were
shipped to Hazen Research Corporation, Golden,
Colorado, where CF-System's Solvent Extraction pilot
plant is located.  The results show that the process is
effective in reducing the concentration of PCBs in site
soils.  Removal efficiencies range from a low of 91.4%
when two extraction cycles are used, to 99.4% when five
extraction cycles are used.

CONTAMINATED SOIL RESTORATION USING VAPOR EXTRACTION

This Master's thesis (from the University of Texas)
presents a review of vapor extraction technology for
remediation of contaminated soils.  Effective
remediation of sites contaminated with VOCs (volatile
organic compounds) requires a sound understanding of
regulatory issues, technology options, and the site
hydrogeology.  A technology that is increasingly being
used for the remediation of VOC-contaminated sites is
soil vapor extraction.  Soil vapor extraction, also
known as soil venting and soil air stripping, allows
remediation of VOC contamination without the need for
excavation.  In soil vapor extraction, a vacuum pump or
blower moves air through the soil near the contaminated
zone.  As contaminated air is removed, cleaner air
moves through the soil to replace it.  This air
movement can also promote microbial degradation of
contaminants at many sites.

IN SITU RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) HEATING TO ENHANCE VAPOR
EXTRACTION OF CONTAMINANTS FROM SOIL

This (Westinghouse Savannah River Co.) report presents
and discusses a field demonstration program involving
in situ radio frequency heating to investigate its
effectiveness as an enhancement to vacuum extraction of
residual solvents (primarily trichloroethylene and
perchloroethylene) held in vadose zone clay deposits.
Conventional soil vacuum extraction techniques are
mass-transfer limited because of the low permeabilities
of the clays.  By selectively heating the clays to
temperatures at or above 100 C, the release or
transport of the solvent vapors are enhanced as a
result of several factors, including: an increase in
the contaminant vapor pressure; an increase in
diffusivity; and an increase in the effective
permeability of the formation caused by the release of
water vapor.

OXYGEN-ENRICHED CO-INCINERATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID
WASTE (MSW) AND SEWAGE SLUDGE

This (NREL) report deals with co-incineration of MSW
and sewage sludge.  Federal regulations banning ocean
dumping of sewage sludge, coupled with stricter
regulations on the disposal of sewage sludge in
landfills, have forced municipalities (especially those
in the northeast U.S.) to consider alternate methods
for disposal of this solid waste.  Co-incineration of
MSW and sludge has proven to be economically attractive
in both Europe and Japan, but has not yet proven to be
a viable sludge disposal technology in the U.S.,
because of a history of operational problems in
existing facilities.  The most prevalent problem in co-
incinerating MSW and a dewatered sewage sludge (15% to
25% solids) is incomplete sludge combustion.
Incomplete combustion is primarily a function of sludge
particle problems that occur when the surface of the
sludge particle dries and hardens while the inner mass
is unaffected.  This phenomenon is commonly referred to
in the industry as the "hamburger effect."

This report details a new process being developed for
the disposal of a dewatered sewage sludge.  It provides
a comprehensive summary of the pilot demonstration test
program for oxygen-enriched co-incineration of MSW and
sewage sludge, including description of: the pilot test
facility; the instrumentation; the methods of data
collection; data analyses; how the tests were executed;
and the test results.  The report also provides
recommendations for the future development of this
technology in the current marketplace.

BIO-OXIDATION TREATMENT OF PETROLEUM-CONTAMINATED SOIL

The need for effective treatment, throughout the U.S.,
of petroleum-contaminated soil has escalated due to the
increase in the number of underground storage tank
(UST) systems being upgraded in response to EPA
regulations.  Remedial options for excavated
contaminated soil have, in the past, been limited to
disposal in land treatment facilities or treatment by
thermal processes.  This (EPA) report reviews and
assesses the state of the art of bio-oxidation
technologies, focusing on above-ground soil mounds.  It
covers: the factors that affect biodegradation; the
types of biotreatment systems; a survey of construction
and performance characteristics; design considerations;
cost estimates; and research recommendations.

CANDIDATE PROCESSES FOR IN SITU TREATMENT OF MIXED VOC
AND RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINANTS IN GROUNDWATER

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report describes
the screening and preliminary evaluation of candidate
treatment for use in treating mixed contaminant
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and radionuclides in
groundwater.  Treating mixed contaminants presents
unusual difficulties.  Typically, VOCs are the most
abundant contaminants, but the presence of
radionuclides results in additional health concerns
that must be addressed, usually by a treatment approach
different from that used for VOCs.  Furthermore, the
presence of radionuclides may yield mixed solid wastes
if the VOCs are treated by conventional means.

These issues are specifically addressed in the
evaluation of candidate treatment processes for testing
in this program.  Moreover, because no research or
early development of a particular process would be
performed, the technology review also focuses on
technologies that could be readily adapted and
integrated for use with mixed contaminants.  The
objective is to couple emerging or available processes
into treatment modules for use in situ.  The findings
reported in this document encompass all activities
through the treatment process evaluations.

MODULAR RISK ANALYSIS FOR ASSESSING SITES CONTAINING
MULTIPLE MIXED RADIOACTIVE WASTES

This (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) report
concerns modular risk analysis for assessing mixed
waste sites.  Human-health impacts, especially to the
surrounding public, are extremely difficult to assess
at installations that contain multiple waste sites and
a variety of mixed waste constituents (e.g., organic,
inorganic, and radioactive wastes).  These assessments
must address: different constituents; multiple waste
sites; multiple release patterns; different transport
pathways (i.e., groundwater, surface water, air, and
overland soil); different receptor types and locations;
various times of interest; population distributions;
land-use patterns; baseline assessments; a variety of
exposure scenarios; etc.  Utilizing a modular/GIS
(geographical information system)-based approach
overcomes difficulties in (1) analyzing a wide variety
of scenarios for multiple mixed waste sites and (2)
communicating results from a complex human-heath-impact
analysis by capturing the essence of the assessment in
a relatively elegant manner -- so the meaning of the
results can be quickly conveyed to all who review them.

WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH 104,000,000 CUBIC FEET OF LOW
LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE

The Fernald Site, a DOE uranium metal production
facility that ceased production in 1989, is now being
remediated by the DOE under terms of a consent
agreement with the EPA and the State of Ohio.  It is
estimated that the cleanup will generate 104,000,000
cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste, including
construction debris, pit sludge, radium residue, and a
huge volume of uranium-contaminated soil.  The waste
handling strategy for this huge volume of waste
includes minimizing remedial waste generation,
recycling material when economically feasible,
free-releasing clean material, and volume reduction.
It is anticipated that large-scale radium residue
vitrification and sludge drying equipment/facilities
will be constructed onsite for waste treatment prior to
off-site disposal.  Fernald waste disposition will
include both onsite disposal (if approved under CERCLA)
and off-site disposal at both commercial and DOE waste
disposal facilities.  The waste disposition strategy
selected reflects a diverse variety of technical,
political, regulatory, and economic factors.  This
(Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Corp.)
paper describes the current views at Fernald on what
can be done with 104,000,000 cubic feet of Fernald
waste.

THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF NUCLEAR SHIPS

This translation from Denmark (Technical University of
Denmark) represents an evaluation of the potential
risks of nuclear ships.  Reasons are given why nuclear
ship accidents will not lead to accidents of the
magnitude of the Chernobyl accident.  This is due to
the much lower content of radioactive material and to
different reactor designs.  A review is given of the
types of nuclear ship accidents that have actually
occurred, with extra consideration given to reactivity
accidents and loss of coolant accidents that could lead
to serious radiation consequences for the crew and the
environment.  The report also discusses the long-term
risks of sunken nuclear ships and sea-disposed reactor
compartments.  Based on available accident data, an
attempt is made to estimate the probability of future
serious nuclear ship accidents.

SLANTS AND TRENDS


Bioremediation Shifts: FIND/SVP Inc., a New York-based
worldwide consulting and research firm, recently published a
170-page report, The Market for Bioremediation Products and
Services. The study focuses on the restoration market as
trends shift from research to actual cleanup. Since its
birth in the mid-1980s, the remediation market has grown
rapidly. "Bioremediation is not only the most
environmentally benign cleanup technology, it is often the
least expensive and the fastest. At a recently documented
groundwater contamination site, non-biological cleanup
methods would have taken up to 50 years to purify the water
and surrounding soils, while bioremediation took only two
years to do the job."

   But there are "formidable challenges" despite the growing
number of sites that require cleanup. The report puts into
perspective the mood of the 104th congress which appears
ready to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). There also is a complicated entanglement of
regulations that inhibit growth and practical application of
research. "Not only is hazardous waste assessment and
cleanup frequently a complex process, negotiating the
bureaucratic bidding process can be even more daunting."
Ethical implications surrounding the introduction of
genetically engineered life forms to degrade contamination
are another area of concern.

   These formidable challenges are not enough, however, to
prevent a compound annual growth rate of 16 percent to the
year 2000, according to FIND/SVP. Although the mood in
congress is hostile to EPA, there is support for military
site cleanup and the timing is such that results from
research are ready for large-scale implementation. "The
development of many new cost-effective and time-saving
bioremediation technologies...will [be favored] over other
cleanup methods." FIND/SVP also predicts cleanup
responsibilities will shift from federal to state and
private-party payers. The report should prove beneficial to
businesses that seek to expand and streamline efforts in a
fairly optimistic market. The Market for Bioremediation and
Services is priced at $2,250 and can be obtained by

EMERGING MARKETS: Interest in environmental goods and
services continues to grow in Central Europe and the former
Eastern Bloc despite political and economic unrest. Many
countries like the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary and
Poland are adopting Western-style environmental regulations.
Privatization also has put cleanup and preventative concerns
in the hands of individuals rather than unaccountable,
state-run bureaucracies. Still, creating a climate conducive
to sustaining a development ethic is difficult in tight
economic times. Pollution prevention and remediation
programs could slow without adequate funding or enforcement
of regulations.

UKRAINE, G-7 FINALLY AGREE
TO REMEDIATE CHERNOBYL


   Closure and remediation of Ukraine's troubled Chernobyl
nuclear power plant may soon begin as a result of the Dec.
20 accord between Kiev and the Group of Seven (G-7) most
industrialized countries. Meeting in Ottawa, the parties
signed a memorandum of understanding that $2.3 billion in
international financial aid would be made available to help
Ukraine close Chernobyl by 2000, according to a statement
issued after the event.

   Canada presently holds the G-7 chairmanship and the deal
was signed by Canadian Environment Minister Sheila Copps and
Ukrainian Environment Minister Yuri Kostenko. The European
Union also is a signatory.

   In addition to closure and remediation, the plan calls
for the development of replacement energy sources, including
the construction of two water-cooled reactors, the statement
says. The two new reactors meet all Western safety
standards, officials said. Western nuclear officials
repeatedly have said they would like all the graphite-
moderated RBMK reactors to be dismantled, replaced with
water-cooled units or otherwise upgraded to meet
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards. The
problem, they say, is funding.

   "The closure of Chernobyl will be an important step
toward improving nuclear safety, not only in Central and
Eastern Europe, but throughout the entire world as well,''
the statement quotes Copps as saying.

   Kostenko has criticized Western governments for focusing
too much attention on Chernobyl while ignoring safety
concerns associated with the former Soviet Union's 11
similar graphite-moderated reactors. Following the signing,
however, he appealed to the West to be promptly forthcoming
with the financial assistance. The Ukraine Environment
Minister said he is concerned about a meltdown occurring at
Russia's Khorsk facility which, because it is near Ukraine,
would be as devastating to Ukraine citizens as was the
Chernobyl accident.

   Although not legally binding, the MOU creates a backdrop
on which concrete closure plans can be based, Kostenko said.
The fact the deal is not binding prompted outrage from
environmental groups, which said such errors as failing to
set a specific shutdown date are major problems. In its
statement, Greenpeace International said offering to help
Ukraine finish work on two more reactors was
counterproductive.

   Aid package specifics include: $498 million in grants
from G-7 member states, $349 million of which will go to
nuclear safety and decommissioning; and $1.8 billion in loan
financing from international agencies. Of the total $2.3
billion, nearly $1.9 billion will be invested in new energy.

NORWAY, RUSSIA WILL COMBINE EFFORTS
TO CLEAN UP SPENT FUEL NEAR BORDER


   In a bid to dispel concerns about radiation hazards posed
by waste facilities on Russia's Kola Peninsula and Novaya
Zemlya Island, Moscow and Oslo agreed to cooperate on
routine inspections and public notifications. In an
agreement reached in Moscow Dec. 15 between Russian Defense
Minister Pavel Grachev and Norwegian Defense Minister
Joergen Kosmo, the two countries will work together to
monitor and eventually dispose of military nuclear waste,
especially spent fuel held near the Norwegian border.

   Russian authorities have denied there are any major
radiation risks on Kola or Novaya Zemlya and want to use
cooperation with an internationally trusted state like
Norway to help dispel some of the negative press. Although
no concrete evidence of radiation leaks has been reported,
people working with such organizations as Norway's Bellona
environmental group say Russian authorities deny them
permission to inspect many military sites.

LOCKHEED TAKES-ON CLEANUP
SPARGING FROM HORIZONTAL WELLS
ATTACKS VOC PLUME IN PINELLAS, FLA.


   An ambitious air sparging system at Lockheed-Martin's
Pinellas Plant, near Largo, Fla., aims at remediating an
entire vinyl chloride plume. Since September, the process
has dramatically reduced contaminant concentrations at all
monitoring wells. Air sparging consists of injecting
compressed air below the water table. As air bubbles upward,
volatile compounds partition into the gas phase and are
carried out of the ground water by rising air. Although air
sparging has been the subject of much research, often in
small field test cells, large-scale deployment of the
technology has been rare. The ground water contaminant plume
being remediated is ideal for  a  pilot  study,  said  Brent
Weesner, engineer in charge of the project at Lockheed-
Martin's Pinellas Plant near Largo, Fla. The plume is about
175 feet long and 75 feet wide, and contains vinyl chloride
at concentrations up to 40 ppb. The plume is well-
characterized. It occurs in an aquifer consisting of very
fine sand about 30 feet thick. A survey using numerous
Hydrocone probes defined the bottom of the aquifer
accurately. The plume is confined mostly to the upper
portion of the aquifer, as shown by Hydrocone samples. All
but two of about 30 samples taken at 25 feet depth showed no
vinyl chloride.

Forget the Monitoring

   Weesner's concept was to go straight for remediation of
the plume, rather than taking the more conventional approach
of carrying out extensive monitoring. Costs for air sparging
were expected to be similar to those for an extended
monitoring program.

   Seven horizontal wells were installed at a design depth
of 28 feet beneath the plume. Lengths ranged from 460 to 560
feet. Wells were drilled from two locations using the "river
crossing" method, in which the drill string was brought back
to the surface at the far end of the drill run. This allowed
pulling the casing through the borehole with a cable, rather
than pushing it into a blind hole from the drilling
location.

   Well installation was relatively uneventful, Weesner
said, in part because of "a great team effort" by the
contractors, GTS Inc., Meriden, Conn. (203-238-4567) and
Consutec, Tampa, Fla. (813-889-7181). The pipe-pulling head
used at first allowed sand to enter the end of the casing.
The contractors designed a better pulling head and had it
built locally.

Special Slotting

   The well casing consisted of two high-density
polyethylene (HDPE) pipes, of 2-inch and 4-inch diameters,
with sand pre-packed between them. Inner and outer casings
had 15 mil slots, cut parallel to the length of the casing
rather than across the casing. Although lengthwise slots are
unusual, they were used in this case to preserve the tensile
strength of the casing, because it had to be pulled through
the borehole. Consutec developed special slotting methods
for this job.

   Another unusual feature of the installation is that the
seven horizontal wells are divided into 15 control zones for
air injection, with one to three control zones per well.
Each control zone is separated from adjacent parts of the
same well, and has its own air control and metering equip-
ment. This arrangement allows concentrating the sparging
efforts in the most contaminated portions of the plume, and
avoids wasting air on portions that have already been
cleaned up. One well with only a single control section was
placed in the middle of the plume so that if sparging had
not worked as planned, the well could have been pumped to
control the spread of the plume.

   Sparge air is collected by a system of pipes laid in
trenches 2 feet deep and backfilled with pea gravel. Pumps
draw the air to a treatment pad, where a carbon filtration
system traps the vinyl chloride for later destruction.

   Results have been very encouraging so far. Sparging
operations started in early September. By October, sampling
showed 1.9 ppb vinyl chloride in one of 19 monitoring wells,
and no detectable concentration in the other 18 wells.
Weesner was concerned, however, that filter packs in the
monitoring wells might act as conduits for air, so that
sparging would be most effective close to the wells - in
other words, the well samples might not be representative of
most of the aquifer.

   During the November sampling, well purging was more
intensive to assure representative sampling. The sparging
system was shut down on a Tuesday, and wells were purged
both Wednesday and Thursday. This time, concentrations were
higher, but still much lower than before sparging - vinyl
chloride concentrations of 1.0 ppb, 1.2 ppb, and 1.9 ppb
were detected in three wells, and none in the remaining 16
wells.

OAK RIDGE OFFERS FIELD SITES
FOR COLLABORATION, RESEARCH


   DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, near Oak Ridge,
Tenn., is offering use of previously studied field sites at
the laboratory for collaborative ground water research.
Research at these sites has focused on water and contaminant
movement in heterogeneous fractured media. Some of the
specific sites available are:

   Walker Branch Watershed and Melton Branch Watersheds:
These small watersheds (0.47 ha and 0.62 ha, respectively)
are particularly suitable for studies of subsurface
transport processes. Each has a trench excavated across its
outflow region. Trenches are 2.5 m deep and 16 m long, and
contain six pans pressed against the face of the trench to
collect subsurface seepage outflow. A line source for tracer
distribution is buried at the top of each site. Transects of
solution samplers, tensiometers and piezometers are located
throughout the site. Much of the data-collection equipment
is interfaced for computerized data collection.

   West Bear Creek Valley Tracer Test Site: This site was
developed for investigating new ground water tracer
techniques. It is located in an uncontaminated area, and has
been instrumented with more than 70 piezometers, some of
them multi-level, and a rain gauge. Water levels and
temperatures have been recorded at 30 minute intervals for
two years. During the last three years, three principal
tests have been conducted at this field site:

A one-year dissolved-gas tracer test using helium and neon
to test the effect of matrix diffusion on solute transport;

A natural-gradient test that used injection of colloid-size
tracers, including bacteriophage, microbes and microspheres,
to measure fracture-flow velocities; and

A test using microspheres labeled with DNA as tracers of
fracture flow.

   Fractured Rock Sampling Protocol Site: This site has been
used for tracer tests to study ground water sampling methods
in fractured media. At the site, 5 to 6 m of soil and
saprolite overlies folded and fractured shale and limestone.
The site has an injection/pumping well screened from 6 to 20
m, three pairs of wells screened from 5 to 7 m and 18 to 20
m, and three multilevel wells with five sampling ports
installed close to the pairs of wells. Many data are
available from the site, including six pumping tests,
natural water levels, tracer tests using bromide, sulfur
hexafluoride and colloids, continuous core from three holes,
bore-hole flowmeter measurements, point dilution tests,
mineralogical data, field parameters, and geochemical
analyses.

   Tritium Test Site: In 1977, 50 curies of tritium were
released in a open borehole in a fractured shale. Tritium
was monitored in the injection well and in five monitoring
wells for the first five years, with an additional sampling
after 16 years (1993). Efforts to remove the tritium by
pumping were unsuccessful. A large amount of tritium was
still present after 16 years. Results of this test have been
interpreted to indicate the severe limitations of pump-and-
treat methods.

Wide Web at http://www.esd.ornl.gov/

   The trend toward fast, field-based assessment of soil and
ground water contamination received a boost from a new
standard developed by the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM). The standard, PS 3, Provisional Standard
Guide for Accelerated Site Characterization of Suspected
Petroleum Release, is aimed at petroleum-contaminated sites,
but clearly indicates the growing interest in rapid site
characterization. The standard does not offer prescriptive
advice for cleanups. Instead, it lists tools than can be
used to collect samples and tests to analyze the samples.
The standard also provides guidance on conducting site
characterizations.

   In the past, field investigators at contaminated sites
usually drilled borings, took samples and had them analyzed
in a laboratory. This produced data that were often very
accurate, but at the cost of waiting weeks for results.
Often the results showed that additional samples were
needed, and a drilling rig had to be re-mobilized to the
site.

   "The task group believes that it is better to get more
data in a matter of days, even though it may be of slightly
less quality, than a few data points with a higher quality
for which you might have to go back and forth to the site
over the course of a couple of years," said Gilberto Alvarez
of Subcommittee E50.01, part of ASTM Committee E-50 on
Environmental Assessment.

MODULARIZATION, AUTOMATION CUT
N.Y. SUPERFUND SITE CLEANUP COSTS


   Capital and operating costs for ground water and soil
cleanup at a Long Island Superfund site have been minimized
by modularization and automation, said Steve McInerney,
senior process engineer and project manager for Retec Co.,
Concord Mass. The Shore Realty Superfund Site is a former
handling facility at Glenwood Landing in Hempstead Harbor,
N.Y., and was heavily contaminated with petroleum and
solvent hydrocarbons during 36 years of operation.

   Retec selected four technologies for site cleanup - soil
vapor extraction, air sparging, ground water pump and treat,
and bioremediation. The ground water system captures free
product at the downgradient side of the site. EPA's pre-
construction estimate of construction cost was $2.3 million.
Actual construction costs, however, were $2 million, a
savings of about 15 percent.

Components Pre-Assembled

   McInerney attributed a significant part of the saving to
modular construction of treatment plant components. Tanks,
mixers, pumps and other components were pre-assembled into a
few modules at the factory, rather than being assembled
piece by piece at the site. Although this somewhat increased
the cost of the components, it allowed greater savings in
the cost of installation at the site.

   Electrical power and control wiring also were assembled
and terminated in boxes on the modules. Each module thus had
only two connection points where it was tied into power and
control wiring. Except for the thermal oxidation unit that
destroys vapor-phase contaminants, no controls were
installed on the modules. All units were tied to controls
located on a central panel.

Estimates Exeeded Actuals

   Operating costs were estimated at $500,000 per year at
the feasibility study stage, but actual costs are about
$300,000 per year. One reason for lower costs is careful
control of electrical consumption. About half the total
operating costs are for a large compressor that drives the
sparging system. Retec has put much effort into optimizing
the system operation. Sparging rates are kept as low as
possible, and sparging is pulsed to increase system
efficiency.

   The plant is highly automated to keep operating costs
low. The plant is computer-operated; the human operator
visits the plant as needed. If a problem develops, the
computer system automat-ically calls the plant operator's
beeper and notifies the operator of the problem's severity -
from level 1, for minor problems, to level 4, for a total
automatic shutdown. The computer system also continuously
collects data from the system for monitoring its operation.
McInerney downloads these data by telephone every two to
three weeks for inspection of the plant's operations and
continuing efficiency.

GETTING INTO THE ACT
AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS ANNOUNCE
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP COOPERATION


   The American Crop Protection Association (ACPA) and the
Agricultural Retailers Association (ARA) announced joint
guidelines to assist the environmental cleanup of retail
agricultural chemical dealer sites. These sites often have
been sources of ground water contamination because of spills
and improper waste disposal.

   The guidelines call for both voluntary and fee-based
reimbursement mechanisms aimed at accelerating assessment
and remediation of contaminated sites. Common elements of
the guidelines, whether voluntary or fee-based, include the
following:

Confidential environmental audits;

Cleanup standards keyed to the future use of the site; and

Acceptance by state authorities of completed remedial
programs.

Incentives

   Key features of voluntary programs include incentives to
property owners, provided sites do not represent immediate
threats to health or the environment, and flexible cleanup
schedules. Key features of fee-based programs are maximum
and minimum balances for the remedial fund, significant
financial deductibles for dealers and growers who initiate
cleanups, ceilings on total reimbursement per remediation
and collection of fees at the retail dealer level.

   To date, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois have enacted
legislation establishing chemical cleanup programs.
Approximately 20 more states, including Ohio and
Pennsylvania, have established voluntary remediation
programs available to everyone, including dealers, growers
and industrial users of agricultural chemicals.

   ACPA is a trade organization of manufacturers,
formulators and distributors of agricultural crop protection
and pest control products. ARA is an organization that
provides information and education to retail farm supply
dealers.

GEL COMPOUND
AUSTRALIAN RESEARCHERS PREVENT
FUELS FROM REACHING DOWN UNDER


   Remediators concerned about safe transportation of
hazardous liquids such as organic solvents, can look to
research being conducted at the University of South
Austrailia where an in-situ gelation process is being
developed. Techsearch, a non-profit group that functions as
a laision with the community, is working with the
University's Polymer Science Group at the Ian Wark Research
Institute to lessen the risk of hazardous liquid cargo
which, if spilled in large quantities, can cause deleterious
affects and long-term environmental damage. Explosion,
flammability, noxious fumes, poisoning, smoke, odors,
irritants and ground water contamination have been a result
of past spills.

   By rapidly injecting a mixture of materials into the
organic liquid, chemical cross-linking occurs in a short
time and a solid network is formed. Solidification prevents
the volatile liquid from escaping holes or ruptures in the
walls of containers damaged during an accident. Gelation
also decreases concentrations of petrol fumes and reduces
the explosion front of fuel which cuts back the possibility
of fire.

10 Percent Solid

   Geoffrey Swincer and Janis Matisons of the University's
School of Chemical Technology discovered the catalytic
process and tested it in laboratory experiments. Certain
compounds - rapidly reacting polymers, monomers, and
functional molecules such as silanes - undergo a rapid
cross-linking action when in contact with fuels which become
trapped in individual cells. The cellular network that
results resembles that of a honeycomb structure. Hard or
gel-like to the touch, the compound may only be 10 percent
solid, 90 percent liquid, when measured by weight.

   The ratio of compound to fuel is relatively low - one
part compound to 30 parts fuel - which is less than 4
percent by volume. Swincer and Matisons feel that continued
research to produce even more efficient gelling compounds
with lower reactive ratios. They also believe that the real
advantage of the process is its speed and that this factor
will lend itself to successful comercialization. Reaction
times have been less than one minute in low-level laboratory
demonstrations. Large volumes of fuel can be gelled in
ruptured tanks or large storage facilities through the use
of a progressive injection system. These delivery systems
can be an integral part of any storage facility or
transportation container. The gel forms a cork or seal
around the point of rupture to prevent further outflow, and
the solidification of the liquid fuel into a mass prevents
it from running underground or into sewer lines and streams.
Damage is quickly limited to the immediate vicinity of the
spill.

Multi-Point Injection

   Conceptualized by Swincer and Matisons, the strategy
behind successful delivery of the gel compound in
transportation tanks is to create a multi-point injection
system, similar to sprinkler systems in large buildings,
around the inner circumference of the container. Activation
would occur upon some predetermined signal, via automatic
detection or manually from a control station. Following the
signal, the entire body of fuel would be surrounded by gel,
the point of rupture sealed, and the core of the liquid
penetrated. A secondary system of directional nozzles, like
those in fire extinguishers, can be applied to any fuel that
has escaped initial treatment. This backup can be used by
ocean going tugs and other emergency vehicles.

Fuel Recycling

   Once the gel compound has done its job, it has to be
cleaned up with shovels and loaders, or by heavy industrial
suction. A gelled slick at sea can be controlled with booms
before being collected and transported by tanker to be
dumped or recycled. One significant advantage of the process
is that fuel can be retrieved by breaking up the gel
structure in a specially designed mixer followed by a
process of filtration and distillation. Compared to more
conventional means of cleanup and recycling, the amount of
fuel lost is far less. Recycling crude after gelation could
be part of the refining process. Researchers estimate
remaining non-toxic solids after recycling to be less than
10 percent of volume and suitable for landfill disposal.

   Researchers also will have to evaluate potential
exothermic reactions of rapid gelation of large volumes of
fuels. The production of heat generated from the process
does not pose a problem in the laboratory, but may in the
field. Evaluating this risk will form part of the next
study.

ENVIRO HAZ TECH OF PA.
MOBILE INJECTION TREATMENT
FOR DENSE CONTAMINATED SOIL


By Elena Marcheso Moreno

   Turning contaminated land into usable construction sites
has great appeal in the competitive world of building
development. Enviro Haz-Tech, an environmental remediation
company in Hegins, Pa., has developed a series of Mobile
Injection Treatment Units (MITUs) that can help remediate
difficult soil conditions, both on unbuilt and built sites.

   Enviro Haz-Tech specializes in treatment of all types of
soils contaminated with petroleum or other hazardous
materials. The patented MITU technology particularly appeals
to building developers because it can handle dense
subsurface contaminated soils under buildings. Cleaning the
soil in place saves developers the costs of transportation
and disposal associated with the alternative solution of
dumping the contaminated soil into landfills, or
incinerating it.

Huge Cost Savings

   By actually treating the soil on-site, the MITU system
can help a land owner save between 40 percent and 60 percent
compared to removing it, Enviro Haz-Tech estimates. Once the
treatment is completed, new soils are not required in order
to develop and build on the site.

   Enviro Haz-Tech's soil treatment unit is comprised of a
John Deere modified hydraulic excavator mounted on a custom
trenching unit equipped with a series of interchangeable
injection systems and full vapor recovery. It includes
proprietary manifolds, pumps, storage tanks, computers,
monitors, and hydraulic controls. The operator can
manipulate all controls from within the cab of the self-
contained unit.

   In addition, the trencher is completely enclosed and has
air emission collection systems that transfer vapors to on-
board treatment equipment. Compliance with air-quality
standards is achieved through computerized monitoring of
organic and inorganic vapors, and other toxic or combustible
emissions.

Soil Injection

   The MITU operator excavates contaminated land within a
predetermined grid, trenching contaminated soil and
injecting it with hot-air, bio-chemicals, slurries, and
stabilization compounds, as required for remediation. All
units use rotary carbide cutting blades that can penetrate
all soils, even dense rock, to depths of 9 meters. A MITU
Mini model was also developed to inject and mix soils to a
maximum depth of 2.5 meters beneath building basements,
concrete slabs, and other structures. The unit's carbide
teeth rotate at three speeds to  break  up  soil
formations   in   46-centimeter widths. Once it has reached
the required depth, one of a variety of injection units
distributes the Enviro mitigating agent into the soil. Soil
passes through the sealed housing, where it is treated.
Microbial and nutrient mixtures are delivered into the
chamber to enhance bioremediation; hot air to encourage
volatile stripping; cement slurry for slurry wall
construction; and absorbants to collect free product. Once
the soil is treated, it is pushed through the undercarriage
of the MITU, reappearing as a clean, fine-grained topsoil.
In all but the most difficult site conditions, the MITU can
treat up to 55 metric tons per hour.

MITU Versatility

   In the past, bioremediation strategies have succeeded
only when employed on porous or semi-porous soils. The new
MITU approach handles all types of soils, according to
Enviro Haz-Tech. In addition to vapor recovery, oils
contaminated with metals or pesticides can be cleaned with
this multiple injection system, which has the ability to
inject remediation agents in the necessary form-solid,
liquid, gas, or slurry.

   When the MITU completes its job, the land left can
immediately be used for buildings that will be occupied by
people. The company recently completed a clean-up project in
Pottsville, Pa., on a site when petroleum had been
distributed. Although the storage tanks were no longer
present, the site was contaminated by past seepage of
petroleum, kerosene, and bunker fuel. Enviro Haz-Tech
cleaned upthe site, which is now being developed for a
100,000 mixed-use warehouse and shopping mall project.

about domestic and international joint ventures. Contact:

ARTHUR D. LITTLE IS AWARDED $7.6 MILLION
TO HELP BELARUS TACKLE DEFENSE WASTE


by Gordon Feller

   The international consulting firm Arthur D. Little has
been awarded a $7.6 million contract to help the former
Soviet republic of Belarus solve environmental problems
related to its former Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF) bases.
The two-and-a-half-year contract from the Defense Nuclear
Agency (DNA) is part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction
(CTR) Program developed under the l991 Nunn-Lugar
legislation intended to assist the countries of the former
Soviet Union in the elimination, and to prevent the
proliferation, of weapons of mass destruction.

   Arthur D. Little experts will help Belarus personnel to
assess the radiation and conventional environmental damage
at sites where intercontinental ballistic missiles were
based, transported, operated, or maintained, and help the
country restore them for other purposes. In Belarus alone,
at the height of the arms race, there were more than 80 SS-
25 missiles. Belarus has since declared itself a non-nuclear
state and wishes to return the facilities to civilian use.

   Arthur D. Little consultants will integrate a number of
different technical resources within the program to provide
training and technical assistance to the Belarus officials
and experts. The consultants will work with the Belarus
personnel to analyze the environmental problems at one
missile site and devise a restoration plan, then oversee the
Belarus technicians as they do environmental restoration
work at a second site. The ultimate goal is to transfer
enough knowledge to Belarus so that they can complete the
environmental restoration work at the remaining sites.

   Potential environmental problems include heavy metal and
low-level radioactive contaminants, spilled petroleum,
spilled liquid rocket fuel, and some minefields around the
sites' perimeters which have unexploded ordnances. As part
of the effort to transfer expertise in the environmental
restoration field, Arthur D. Little will conduct
international conferences co-sponsored by DNA and the
Belarus Ministry of Defense. Experts from around the world
will be invited to Belarus to discuss a variety of
environmental restoration experiences, technologies, and
management issues.

   As part of the CTR program, an agreement was signed in
l993 between the United States and the Republic of Belarus
to assist in development of the Environmental Restoration
Project. Other CTR projects in Belarus under Nunn-Lugar
include assistance in defense conversion, export control
systems and training, government-to-government
communications links, and emergency response equipment and
training.

   Belarus, located between Poland and Russia, has an
especially high water table and active groundwater movement,
which can exacerbate groundwater pollution. Other
organizations involved with Arthur D. Little on the
Environmental Restoration Project include the Army Corps of
Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Los Alamos Technical
Associates, Technology Management Company, the Environmental
Chemical Corp., the Environmental Hazards Specialists
International, Environmental Careers Organizations, the
World Environment Center, and Clean Sites, Inc.

   Arthur D. Little, which conducted the largest
environmental impact assessment ever conducted in the Former
Soviet Union by a Western company, has handled more than
3,000 environmental audits and assessments in 30 countries
throughout Europe and the United States. Headquartered in
Cambridge, MA., Arthur D. Little has offices around the
world. It provides consulting in three areas: environmental,
health, and safety consulting; management consulting; and
technology and product development.

INFO FOR INVESTMENT?
RECENT EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENTS
KEY TO BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES


Russia Having Trouble With CFCs: Russia is asking for more
time to cut ozone-threatening substances. At a major
international conference of government representatives
convened in Vienna to review the 1987 Montreal Protocol on
ozone protection, Russian Federation Environment Minister
Viktor Danilov-Danilyan said Russia needs more time and a
larger pool of investment aid in order to develop
substitutes to ozone-harming substances such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Under the Montreal Protocol,
signed by 150 countries, such industrialized countries as
Russia are to stop producing CFCs by 1996 and the rest of
the signatories by 2010. Minister Danilov-Danilyan said the
Russian Federation is now producing only half the ozone-
threatening chemicals it was in 1987, but he added that the
drop was a by-product of the fall in industrial output. The
minister was quick to point out that he and his government
would  have  preferred  to  be able to meet the deadline, as
other governments are doing, but that the economic
conditions prevailing within his country are making it
impossible for the principal factories from even paying
their workers, let alone their taxes and electric bills. It
will be impossible for the Russian government to force such
enterprises, even if they are state-owned (and many are not)
to comply with the protocol when the ministry has no
financial capacity to support the enterprise's change-over
to non-CFC production or usage.

German, Swiss, Finnish Waste: Germany and Switzerland have
decided not to send spent nuclear fuel to Krasnoyarsk-26 for
processing, Krasnoyarsk Krai Deputy Governor Sergei Arinchin
was quoted as saying. The waste would have been processed at
the RT-2 plant - still under construction - in the formerly
secret nuclear center in Siberia. The Russian authorities
had hoped to finance the project by accepting foreign waste,
enabling them to process their own stocks. The Swiss and
German pullout will deal a major blow to the project. The
decision is likely to be hailed by environmental groups,
which have strongly opposed the importation of nuclear
materials, arguing that Russia's waste storage sites are
already overflowing. Meanwhile, a trainload of spent nuclear
fuel from a Finnish nuclear power plant reportedly has
arrived in Russia for processing at the Mayak plant in
Chelyabinsk-65. An English translation of the Komsomolskaya
Pravda newspaper says it is not yet clear whether the
nuclear residue remaining after processing will be shipped
back to Finland or kept inside the Russian Federation.

Nuclear Safety Threatened: Nuclear safety may be threatened
by workers at Russia's nuclear power plants, who say they
may shut down the facilities unless they receive overdue
wage payments. Officials say they have scheduled warning
protests, but it is not clear what form they will take.
Energy consumers owe nuclear power plants about 2.5 trillion
rubles (US$555 million), and on average workers have not
been paid for three months, according to the deputy head of
Rosenergoatom in Moscow.

German Assistance: A German company has signed a contract
with Russia's Kursk nuclear power plant to construct a
nuclear waste storage facility and to provide 240 containers
to store the plant's radioactive waste. The German Company
for Nuclear Containers, a Nukem subsidiary, will control
production quality, train specialists and provide the know-
how for production. According to Gosatomnadzor, Russia's
nuclear safety agency, the solid waste storage facilities at
the Kursk plant are full.

Troubled Kazakhstan: The amount of radioactive waste
accumulating at uranium mining and processing plants in
Kazakhstan reportedly is reaching alarming proportions.
Since this large, very poor Central Asian country became
independent in 1991, the quantity of radioactive waste
stored in Kazakhstan has grown to 219 million metric tons.
The republic's Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources
claims the aggregate radioactivity from the waste comes to
250,000 curies, which is "many times more than the accepted
norm." Kazakhstan does not have the means to deal with the
waste because under the Soviet Union's regime disposal was a
national responsibility carried out by the government in
Moscow. Today, there are neither any Kazakh laws nor
bilateral agreements with Russia which adequately address
this type of nuclear waste disposal dilemma.

FOODSTUFFS: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL AGREE ON LABELLING

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

Delegations from the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers
reached a compromise on October 16 - through the Conciliation Committee -
on the labelling and advertising of foodstuffs, thus settling a row over
the proposed amendments to Directive 79/112/EEC). The Parliament claims
the agreement reflects its commitment to the principle of free trade in
the Union, as stated in the ruling by the European Court of Justice on
October 26, 1995 in the "bearnaise sauce case", and whose scope the
Council appeared anxious to limit. By contrast, negotiations between the
Parliament and Council on the labelling of novel foods have yet to be
concluded and are being pursued.

On June 15, 1995, the Council of Ministers adopted a common position on
the amendment of Articles 3 (list of requisite details for inclusion in
labelling), 6 (single ingredient foods), 7 (quantitative declaration of
ingredients), and 14 (language used on labelling) of the proposal for a
Directive. On October 25, 1995, the Schnellhardt report (EPP, Germany) was
approved in second reading by the European Parliament, which adopted five
amendments: one to Article 1 of Directive 79/112 (trade name of a food),
three to Article 6 (list of ingredients), and one amendment to Article 7
(quantitative declaration of ingredients). With the Council unwilling to
accept three of the five amendments tabled by the plenary session, the
conciliation procedure was initiated on December 22, 1995.

In its ruling on the "bearnaise sauce" case, the Court of Justice deemed
Germany to be in breach of Article 30 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits
quantitative restrictions on imports, and all measures having equivalent
effect. In Germany, the traditional recipe for bearnaise sauce is based on
butter and eggs. The authorities demanded that imported sauces
manufactured according to a different recipe should bear the mention
"bearnaise sauce made from vegetable oil" and not the generic name
"bearnaise sauce". The Court ruled that Germany has no right to demand
such an indication on labelling of the product, as the term "bearnaise
sauce" is quite sufficient.

The joint text to emerge from the conciliation talks provides for a
product to be sold in other Member States under the legal name it carries
in the Member State of production - except in very exceptional cases. The
compromise takes account of pressure from certain Member States following
the "bearnaise sauce" ruling, by stipulating that the trade name can be
complemented by additional information printed adjacently. On the express
demand of the European Parliament delegation, these provisions are however
included under certain conditions: the list of ingredients (and other
provisions of the Directive) must not prevent consumers in the Member
State where a product is marketed from determining the real nature of the
food, and there must be no risk of confusion with other products.

MEPs believe this provision will have little impact in practice, as the
"bearnaise sauce" ruling clearly indicates that a list of ingredients
should be sufficient to prevent any confusion on the part of the consumer.
Moreover, the text of the Treaty must take precedence over secondary
legislation.

In respect of people suffering from allergies, the Parliament secured
Council approval for clear labelling of the specific vegetable origin of
starches entering into the composition of products and likely to contain
gluten.

It now remains for the two institutions to formally adopt this compromise,
the Council by qualified majority, the European Parliament by a simple
majority. However, the Parliament's delegation emphasised that it will not
recommend its adoption by the plenary session unless the European
Commission pledges to bring forward a specific proposal on the labelling
of alcoholic beverages, which are not covered by the present Directive.

Novel foods.

Are novel foods (a term covering genetically-modified products: soya
beans, sugar beet, flavour-saver tomatoes, etc.) different from
traditional foods and if so, to what extent? This question fuelled a first
exchange of views between delegations from the European Parliament and the
Council on October 16 at the Conciliation Committee.

Parliament is demanding that food labels should inform consumers of all
the characteristics and properties that distinguish a novel food or food
ingredient from an existing equivalent food or ingredient. The Council of
Ministers believes such information is only justified where there is a
"significant" difference with the traditional food.

The Conciliation Committee will have to settle the issue and, under the
context of co-decision procedure, draw up a compromise text for a proposal
for a Regulation on the marketing in the Community of novel foods and food
ingredients. In second reading on March 12, 1995, the European Parliament
adopted six amendments to the common position approved by the Council on
October 23, 1995. Compromise proposals are currently being examined and
the delegations may reach an agreement in the coming weeks.

This Regulation must guarantee that novel foods and food ingredients
present no risk to public health or the environment and are the object of
detailed labelling. It will also define procedures on the European level
for the marketing of these products throughout the Community. It says that
genetic engineering must only be used to improve the taste, flavour and
shelf life of products, or to protect against insect attack or ensure
resistance to herbicides.

DEREGULATING PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMERS.

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

Just as France was reaffirming the importance of the inclusion of public
services in the Maastricht Treaty, at the European Council in Dublin on
October 5, Rome was hosting an International Forum on "the deregulation of
public and consumer services", organised on the initiative of the European
Commission and Italy's competition and markets authority. Following on
from its recent Communication on general interest services in Europe, the
Commission was anxious to relaunch the deregulation debate by emphasising
European citizens' interests (and expectations), in the presence of
representatives of institutions, industry, utilities and consumer
associations. Faced with the reticence of certain Member States and
sectors concerned, the Commission has put its faith in the
citizen-consumer to support the ongoing process. But the man in the street
still has to be convinced of the advantages to be gained from deregulating
public services, and reassured of the maintenance of "unalienable" general
interest services. The Rome meeting was intended at a first step towards
this goal.

CRESSON PUTS CASE FOR BETTER FOCUSED RESEARCH PROGRAMME

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

Addressing a gathering at the University of Bonn, in Germany, on October
16, Edith Cresson, the European Commissioner with responsibility for
Research, argued that the 5th European Framework Programme on Research and
Technological Development (RTD) (1999-2002) must not be a mere extension
of its predecessors. The Commissioner emphasised the importance of
evolving away from research focusing exclusively on technological
performance, and towards research focusing better on economic and social
needs. The Commission guidelines for the 5th Framework Programme were
presented in September in the form of a working paper ("Inventing
tomorrow") designed to launch the debate.

Mrs Cresson highlighted her own creed on European research policy which
should, first and foremost, serve the needs of society. She insisted this
goal is not at variance with the need for strong basic research in Europe:
contemporary research is indeed characterised by an increasingly rapid
convergence of theoretical breakthroughs and practical results.

Turning to the place of research/industry Task Forces in the 5th Framework
Programme, Mrs Cresson indicated they should in principle remain as
support structures for projects targeted at themes of great social and
economic importance. She also highlighted the relations between RTD
policy, regional and cohesion policy, an issue of much concern in Germany,
insisting that "while Union research actions can contribute directly to
strengthening the economic and social cohesion of different regions,
seeking to obtain this effect by sacrificing the criteria of scientific
excellence would be a grave error". It would, she argues, be more
appropriate to "coordinate the implementation of research programmes and
regional policy actions".

The European Commissioner recalled the timetable for the introduction of
the 5th Framework Programme:

- The Commission will present a more detailed working paper before the
year's end, describing in greater depth the scientific and technological
objectives to be pursued and the procedures for implementation; this
document will however remain sufficiently open to stimulate a genuine
policy debate on the options proposed.

- A formal proposal will be presented at the beginning of 1997, with a
view to its adoption at the beginning of 1998.

STEEL CANS RECYCLING RATE EXCEEDS 40%

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The recycling rate for steel cans in Europe reached 41% in 1995, an
increase of more than 20% in just one year, according to APEAL, the
Association of European Packaging Steel Producers. This puts the industry
well above the target of 15% for all materials set out in the Directive on
packaging and packaging wastes. The Association claims that about a
million tonnes of steel were collected and recycled last year. Germany is
setting the trend in Europe with a recycling rate of 67%, followed by the
Netherlands (58%), France (40%) and Belgium (30%). Spain and Britain are
trailing somewhat with 17 and 16% respectively. APEAL forecasts that
recycling rates will reach 65% by 2005. In Europe, food tins account for
50% of steel packaging, industrial packaging such as drums for 20%,
beverage cans 10%, aerosols 10%, and other objects 5%.

The members of APEAL are: the British Steel Tinplate (GB), Cockerill
Sambre (B), Corporacion Siderurgica Nacional (Sp), Hoogovens Packaging
Steel (Nl), ICMI (I), Norsk Blikkvalseverk (N), Rasselstein Hoesch (Ger),
Sollac (F).

EIB LENDS TURKEY ECU 50 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The European Investment Bank is lending ECU 50 million for an
environmental protection project in Turkey. The loan is being advanced to
Izmit Greater Municipality to help cover the cost of collection and
treatment of industrial effluents in the province of Kocaeli, one of the
most industrialised provinces in Turkey. The project will halt the
contamination of local rivers and thereby will help to protect and improve
water quality in the Gulf of Izmit (Marmara Sea). Financing is granted
under the environmental section of the "Off-Protocol Facility", benefiting
from a 3% interest subsidy from the Community Budget, under the EU's
Redirected Mediterranean Policy, designed to support investment in the
fields of regional cooperation and environment protection, developing
links at regional levels and with the Union's economy.

INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL OF THE SEA INVESTS JUDGES.

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The investiture of the 21 judges who are to sit on the International
Tribunal of the Sea, a United Nations institution set up to arbitrate
disputes over fishing, navigation and pollution, was held in the German
town of Hamburg on October 18. The ceremony was attended by UN
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who called on more countries to
sign the Tribunal's Charter. Notable exceptions include the United States
and Britain, while France and Russia have still to ratify the document.
The basis for the Tribunal's work, the Agreement on the Law of the Sea has
thus far been signed by 107 of the UN's 185 member countries. Mr
Boutros-Ghali explained that the Tribunal will be charged with
implementing provisional measures where the marine environment is
seriously threatened, and should lead to a more rapid resolution of
disputes over fisheries, navigation and pollution. It will also have the
power to order the release of impounded vessels, against the deposit of a
guarantee. The Tribunal's rulings will not be subject to appeal. Where
disputes arise, States will be free to appeal either to the Tribunal or to
the International Court of Justice in the Hague. The Tribunal is chaired
by Thomas Mensah of Ghana.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: MAKING A COME-BACK

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The European Commission is said to be pondering the idea of resuscitating
a proposal that has been deeply buried for several years now and seeks to
ensure that the environment is taken into account at the start of the
decision-making chain. European Commissioner for the Environment Ritt
Bjerregaard is inciting her colleagues to adopt the draft environmental
impact assessment Directive for the policies, plans and programmes of the
Member States. It is scheduled to appear on the provisional agenda for the
Commissioners' October 30 meeting. The existing Directive on the
environmental impact assessment of public and private projects proposes an
impact assessment much further up the political decision-making chain. Mrs
Bjerregaard's new Directive is intended to ensure the Member States'
programmes and strategies are effectively vetted for their environmental
impact. Green MEPs and environmental protection lobbies have accused the
Commission of holding up the proposal, pending a decision on the major
trans-European transport networks, which they claim would by their very
nature contravene the proposal.

CHEMICAL INDUSTRY: COMMISSION RIGHT TO REFUSE CFC IMPORT LICENCE, SAYS
COURT

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

In an October 16 ruling, the Court of First Instance of the European
Communities dismissed an appeal by Efisol of France against the European
Commission's refusal to grant it a licence to import chlorofluorocarbons
11 (CFC 11) in 1994. After obtaining an import quota of 1,800 tonnes of
CFCs for 1994, Efisol expected the Commission to grant it an import
licence as is usual following attribution of a quota. The Commission
declined to do so. Efisol, meanwhile, had already ordered and transported
some of the CFCs in question at a cost of over two million French Francs.
The Court found that Efisol had acted unwisely, but admitted that the
Commission had not acted entirely correctly either.

Under Regulation 594/91, trade within the EU of CFCs imported from third
countries is subject to quotas granted by the Commission to the firms in
question (CFCs are now banned in the EU). The quota, however, must be
supplemented by an import licence granted by the Commission for CFCs to be
imported. A firm desiring a licence must submit an application to the
Commission describing the substances it wishes to import, the quantity and
the use to which they will be put. The various possible uses provided for
on the application form include "feedstock in the manufacture of other
chemicals".

After an exchange of letters between Efisol and the Commission, the French
company indicated that the CFCs to be imported would be used as "feedstock
in the manufacture of other chemicals", specifically polyurethane foam.
The Commission did not react rapidly enough to the provision of what was
later found to be inaccurate or even erroneous information by Efisol. CFCs
are not completely destroyed or broken down during the manufacture of
polyurethane foam and therefore this process does not meet the definition
of the "manufacture of other chemicals". It was the French Ministry that
informed the Commission that the imported CFCs would not be used to
produce other chemicals.

Efisol placed orders with its Russian suppliers on February 17 and 20,
1994, only a few days after submitting its application for a licence on
February 15 and before it had received a response. On February 24, the
Commission informed Efisol of its refusal to grant the import licences.
One train was already rolling towards France carrying a cargo of CFCs 11
and another was headed for Russia to pick up another load. When informal
negotiations failed, Efisol demanded compensation for the costs of
transporting the first load and running the empty train and for lost
production and sales. The Commission claimed that Efisol had "attempted to
mislead the Commission as to the exact use to which the substances were to
be put" and had "purchased orders from its Russian supplier (...) before
the Commission denied the application for the licence". The parties are
also at loggerheads over the issue of whether a licence should
automatically be granted following the attribution of a quota. The
Commission considered the two separate actions.

The Court found against Efisol, which claimed that the Commission had
violated the principle of legitimate expectations, arguing that once the
quota had been allocated, the Commission was required to issue a licence.
The Court said that a "cautious and informed operator would not have
initiated rail transport of the cargoes ordered without waiting for the
Commission's decision and without taking the necessary steps to protect
its interests if its application for a licence was refused". The import
rights granted with the attribution of a quota become effective only when
the import licence is granted, the Court said. By placing orders only two
days after applying for a licence, the "the complainant put itself in
danger". The Court further ruled that it is scientifically inaccurate to
describe polyurethane foam as a "chemical". However, the Commission
"applied Community Regulations incorrectly" by granting Efisol a quota for
this type of use, the Court said. "The Commission's behaviour was not in
keeping with Community Regulations and thus could not have raised
justified hopes on the part of the complainant". Since "the emergence of
conflict was fuelled by the Commission's action", the Commission was
ordered to pay all the legal costs.

Calif. operators push environmental plan

     Western States Petroleum Assn. has unveiled a
blueprint for California's Kern County that may enable
oil and gas producers, environmentalists, endangered
plants and animals, and county, state and federal
government officials to co-exist peacefully and
beneficially.
     The specifics of the plan are contained in a WSPA
"white paper" designed to be consistent with the
protection of endangered species outlined in a 1989
memorandum of understanding among Kern County,
the California Fish & Game Dept.'s oil, gas and
geothermal division and the federal Fish & Wildlife
Service and Bureau of Land Management.
     "It's a great first step," said WSPA's Mike
Emanuel, of the white paper's chances of leading
toward an agreement among the parties involved.
     Other principles guiding development of the paper
included meeting requirements of the federal and
California endangered species acts while allowing for
economic growth and development in Kern County;
providing a reliable process for landowners to
compensate for or mitigate impacts on sensitive
species; and distributing the conservation burden
broadly and fairly among public and private
landowners, based on the impact of their activities on
sensitive species.
     A look at the makeup of Kern County's
environment makes clear the need for some kind of
coordinating plan. Oil fields in the county account for
about 592,000 b/d, or two out of every three barrels
produced in California. Kern County blankets the
southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, which was
recently described in a guide book as follows: "No
national park, no recreation area, no wildlife refuge
anywhere in the contiguous 48 states has a wider
variety of rare and endangered birds, animals and plant
life than can be found in the southern San Joaquin
Valley."
     WSPA's paper calls for providing incentives for
preservation and development to occur in patterns that
preserve large, connected blocks of highly valued
habitat. The plan would divide the valley floor into four
zones, including three for which compensation for
development would be required and a fourth in which
no compensation would be required because of the
absence of valuable habitat.
     The latter area, a "gray zone," represents heavily
disturbed areas that do not fit into the overall
conservation strategy, such as oil fields with well
spacing of four acres or less.
     Compensation for other zones would be based on a
ratio no greater than 3-to-1, which would be used to
calculate the level of compensation required.
Compensation for development within the three zones
would be in the form of credits generated by the
permanent preservation of habitat, granting of
conservation easements or other specified measures.
     Red, green and white zones would be used to
determine the habitat value of any parcel within the
plan area in terms of habitat units (h.u.).
     Three habitat units per acre would be offered for a
red zone, the lands of highest value for conservation
purposes; two units for a green zone, land less
important than a red zone but still valuable for
conservation purposes, particularly to provide
connectivity across the reserve system; and one habitat
unit for a white zone, covering a large area with widely
varying, but typically low, biological values that could
not contribute significantly to long-term conservation
strategy.
     White zone lands generally would not be available
for compensation.
     A formula would be adopted for adjusting habitat
unit values based on consideration of connectivity with
other habitat. Landowners would receive transferable
habitat unit credits for granting land for preservation
purposes or taking other specified conservation
actions.
     A monitoring plan would be established, creating
the ability to adjust the valley floor habitat conservation
plan over time as necessary to meet conservation
goals.
     Landowners who preserve habitat would receive
credits based on the habitat unit value of the land
preserved, and owners who disturb habitat would
compensate based on the habitat unit value of the area
disturbed at the compensation ratio.
     If the ratio is 3-to-1, compensation for taking in
each of the three zones would be as follows:

     ** Red zone (worth 3 h.u./acre) -- Compensate
with 9 h.u./acre of impact, which could be done with
either 3 acres in the red zone or 4.5 acres in the green
zone.
     ** Green zone (worth 2 h.u./acre) -- Compensate
with 6 h.u./acre of impact, which could be either 2
acres in the red zone or 3 acres in the green zone.
     ** White zone (worth 1 h.u./acre) -- Compensate
with 3 h.u./acre of impact, which could be done with
either 1 acre in the red zone or 1.5 acres in the green
zone.

     While the approach doesn't place an absolute cap on
development in any one zone, it effectively would cap
the total loss of habitat value at 25%, because at a 3-to-
1 compensation ratio, 75% of the habitat value would
be protected from development.
     The approach based on habitat value would provide
a more meaningful conservation than one based on
acreage, according to WSPA, because the habitat value
measure provides strong incentives to compensate in
large, connected areas of highly valued habitat, as well
as strong disincentives to disturb those areas.
     The plan also recognizes habitat that is restored to
an established standard. If an oil field is restored to the
established standard after abandonment, thereby
undoing a habitat disturbance for which habitat credits
were previously provided as compensation, the
landowner could reuse those credits.
     Among conservation advantages claimed for the
approach are providing incentives that will result in a
very high percentage of habitat preserved in the most
sensitive areas, strong positive incentives to restore
land to native habitat after it has been put to a
temporary industrial use such as oil operations, and
strong incentives for habitat to be preserved in large,
connected configurations.
     Among economic advantages claimed for the plan
are providing both large and small landowners a timely
and predictable means of obtaining value for high-
value habitat on their property; a timely, predictable
and flexible means of compensating for habitat loss
with minimal costly survey requirements; a certain
equity among landowners with lands of different
habitat quality; and ways for landowners to minimize
their compensation requirements over time by doing a
good job of cleaning up after themselves by restoring
land to native habitat.

Enviros face united front in badlands battle

     An unlikely coalition of oil and gas producers,
ranchers, business people, politicians, and Indians have
joined forces in North Dakota to oppose a plan to turn
a huge chunk of the state's western badlands into a
wilderness preserve.
     At issue is a proposal by wildlife and
environmental groups spearheaded by the Sierra Club
that Congress declare 191,000 acres in the state as a
wilderness area. Eighty-two percent of that lies in the
Little Missouri National Grasslands area of the
badlands. The remaining acreage is in the Sheyenne
Grasslands near Lisbon, N.D., and the J. Clark Salyer
National Wildlife Refuge in McHenry and Bottineau
counties.
     The proposal, detailed in the environmental groups'
publication "Badlands on the Brink," would allow
hunting, hiking, camping and livestock grazing, but
would ban further oil and gas development. Motorized
vehicles would be banned except for ranchers making
repairs and improvements.
     More than 100 opponents of the plan got together
last week in Dickinson, N.D., to talk strategy. They are
worried that strict preservation will damage oil and
cattle businesses and eventually doom Dickinson and
other, smaller towns in that part of the state.
     The proposal was dealt a blow at the meeting when
the Three Affiliated Tribes, a Native American group
listed by the Sierra Club as a sponsor of the plan,
withdrew its support and said it will cancel its Sierra
Club membership.
     "It's going to take a lot of the economic
development away from the tribe, and oil development
and cattle ranching," said tribal Vice Chairman Ivan
Johnson. He said the tribe didn't know it was listed as
a sponsor for the wilderness proposal until tribal
officials started fielding calls from area ranchers.
     County, city and school boards in the western
section of North Dakota depend on taxes from oil and
gas revenues to fund their budgets. Five counties
would be affected by the wilderness plan. For the state,
oil tax revenues made up 10% of the 1989-91 general
fund budget.
     Mike Armstrong of Dickinson, an independent oil
producer, said at the meeting it's natural for oil and gas
operators and ranchers to join forces. "We need to
protect the resources they're trying to take from our
state. All this land is open to public use now, except
the private land."
     Those at the meeting decided to start a letter-writing
campaign to the state's congressional delegation and
advocated "arm twisting" North Dakota Gov. Ed
Schafer to join their cause.
     The group -- which still needs a name -- will form a
working association of ranchers, oil and gas producers,
businesses and government officials. They plan to
compile resolutions from groups opposed to the plan,
gather economic impact statistics and print a brochure
defending badlands development.
     Alice Benitiz, lands director for the Rocky
Mountain Oil & Gas Assn., attended the meeting and
told E&PE the Sierra Club's push to have the
grasslands designated as a wilderness area smacked of
"sour grapes."
     Benitiz said, "The badlands and other areas of
North Dakota have been studied for almost 20 years
by the U.S. Forest Service to determine their suitability
as wilderness areas." And each time, she said, the
agency had decided the region could not be managed
as wilderness because of the level of development and
importance of oil and gas production and ranching to
surrounding communities.
     "The environmental groups have failed through the
very public process in which they were involved to get
the Forest Service to halt oil and gas activity," she said.
"And this mechanism [legislation] is the only way they
have left."

NRC touts 'super' environmental agency

     The National Research Council has proposed in a
report due out later this summer that the U.S. make
sweeping and fundamental changes in the way it
handles environmental problems.
     Entitled Research to Protect, Restore and Manage
the Environment, the 241-page study takes dead aim at
the way the federal government conducts
environmental research. Existing programs are poorly
structured, uncoordinated and hampered by the lack of
clear leadership at the highest levels of government, the
NRC report said.
     NRC recommended establishment of a national
environmental council, chaired by the vice president,
composed of the heads of the federal environmental
agencies, and aided by advisory committees made up
of representatives from the scientific community, the
public, state government, and the private sector.
     The council would provide leadership and
coordination among federal agencies for environmental
research and oversee implementation of a national plan
to identify a research agenda and the responsibilities of
individual agencies.
     NRC also proposed the creation of an
environmental assessment center to convey policy
options to the national environmental council,
Congress and the involved parties. If the U.S. is to
make major improvements in the quality of its
environmental research and policy programs, NRC
said EPA has to be elevated to cabinet status with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin., the U.S.
Geological Survey and parts of NASA becoming part
of a Dept. of the Environment.
     Washington distributes about $5 billion annually to
more than 20 federal agencies for environmental
research. But, NRC points out, there "is no
comprehensive national environmental research plan to
coordinate the efforts" of the agencies.
     "Moreover, no agency has the mission to develop
such a plan, nor is any existing agency able to
coordinate and oversee a national environmental
research plan if one were designed," the report adds.
     Science and engineering "have the tools to address
environmental problems of enormous consequence to
our social and economic well being," the study said.
"But we aren't using those tools most effectively."
     Bridges between policy, management and science
are weak, the report said. And there is no organized
system to communicate assessments of environmental
problems to decision-makers and policy-setters.
     To order a copy of the report, contact the National
Academy Press at 800-624-6242.

Emissions-control process patented

     Radian Corp. and the Gas Research Institute have
completed work on an emissions-control process for
triethylene glycol dehydrators that maximizes
emissions recovery while retaining hydrocarbons for
resale.
     The process, know as Recovery-BTEX, or R- BTEX,
was developed by Radian as part of research on glycol
dehydrators sponsored by GRI. Radian's Phil Lowell
recently patented the process (U.S. Patent No.
5,209,762); the patent rights have been assigned to GRI.
     R-BTEX addresses the issue that all natural gas,
whether it's produced directly from the source
formation or from a storage reservoir, contains some
water that must be removed to prevent hydrate
formation and minimize corrosion during
transmission. Glycol dehydrators remove water from
the gas stream, but in the process also remove some
volatile organic compounds (VOCs); among them are
benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene, collectively
known as BTEX.
     When glycol is regenerated, absorbed water is
boiled off along with the volatile hydrocarbons,
including BTEX, and released into the atmosphere.
     In 1989, Louisiana's Environmental Quality Dept.
spearheaded an effort to quantify the amount of BTEX
and other VOCs released from glycol dehydrators. The
department surveyed more than 200 glycol
dehydrators processing at least 5 mmcf/day of natural
gas that were operated by producing, processing,
pipeline and storage companies.
     The study found that levels of BTEX and other
VOCs from glycol units were high enough to be a
concern for the industry. There are an estimated 30,000
glycol dehydrators in use in the U.S. The Clean Air
Act has potentially wide-ranging consequences for
glycol units because BTEX are included in the list of
189 air toxic pollutants and may be emitted at levels
that would cause many glycol units to be defined as
major sources.
     If so, the units would be required to use and
comply with the maximum achievable control
technology (MACT) standards. And while MACT
technologies are considered state-of-the-art and
efficient, industry contends they are not necessarily
designed to be cost-effective.
     Radian's process is based on the established
technologies of stripping, condensation and phase
separation. GRI says R-BTEX provides a cost-
effective alternative for controlling BTEX emissions.
R-BTEX is designed for new or retrofit applications.
     Since the water recovered from the gas is used as
the coolant, the process operates at condenser
temperatures below those reached using air cooling.
And in most cases, that makes possible a 95%
recovery of hydrocarbons as saleable liquids. R-BTEX
can control BTEX emissions by as much as 99.9% if
vented BTEX is controlled at the condenser vent and
flash tank.
     Researchers said the blowdown water from the R-
BTEX cooling tower has a very low concentration of
dissolved organics and can sometimes be directly
discharged without further treatment.
     Two tests were conducted last year using two gas-
processing scenarios to evaluate the effect of gas
pressure, BTEX concentration, glycol recirculation
rate, and reboiler temperature on process performance.
For each test, the production rate was 75 mcf/day of
gas.
     One test was conducted in a high-pressure field of
900 psi with gas containing 750 ppm BTEX. The
other was carried out in a lower pressure field of 400
psi with gas containing 300 BTEX.
     In the first case, researchers recovered 9.2 b/d of
BTEX with emissions of 0.78 lbs/day. In the second
test, 7.4 b/d were removed with emissions of 0.63
lbs/day of BTEX.

Indiana considers bird netting rules

     The Indiana Natural Resources Dept. is drawing up
regulations for mandatory covers on drilling and
production reserve pits.
     Sparking the movement is an incident that occurred
this spring north of Princeton, Ind., in Gibson County.
Two wood ducks were pulled from a pit by officials
from the department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. The ducks later died.
     Their deaths spurred a criminal inquiry and received
widespread publicity in the Illinois Basin. The incident
was also discussed at last month's meeting of the
Independent Petroleum Assn. of America in
Washington.
     Migratory birds and other wildlife are protected by
federal laws under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and
the Endangered Species Act. But Jim Slutz, head of
the department's Oil and Gas Division, said it is often
up to the individual state to enforce the oil industry's
compliance with regulations.
     He promised strong action in this and other reserve
pit events in Indiana, including steep fines and civil and
criminal charges. Federal violations also carry stiff
penalties and fines.
     To date, oilfield operations in the Midwest and
Appalachian states have dodged the bird netting
controversy. But state legislation requiring netting on
reserve pits is also being considered in Illinois and
Kentucky, said Craig Howard, president of the
Independent Oil Producers Assn., Tri-State.
     "A lot of attention is being given to the Endangered
Species Act and the necessity to prevent entry into
pits," he said. "It has become a serious issue, even
though the Gibson county incident is the only one to
receive publicity during the past 40 years."
     Department officials have begun to inspect more
reserve pits around the state, looking for violations.
Howard said some Illinois Basin producers have
begun to install bird netting, or are using storage tanks
to recycle drilling fluids or hold produced water to be
in compliance with federal laws or any state laws that
may be forthcoming.

ERCB calls for drilling waste management

     Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board
has directed provincial oil and gas operators to submit
a waste disposal plan with well license applications
when hydrocarbon- or salt-based mud will be used or
produced during drilling.
     Re-entry situations that use an oil- or salt-base
drilling fluid system but don't need a well license
application require a waste disposal plan. Producers
will also have to retain the plan in their files because it
will be needed when they apply for a reclamation
certificate afterward.
     The plan must indicate the type of hydrocarbon or
salt used in the mud, estimated volume of drilling
waste to be generated, any additives, additional
treatment processes used such as incineration or reuse,
equipment used to reduce soil contamination and waste
volume and method of handling completion fluids.
     If an operator intends to use landfarming to dispose
of waste, the plan must provide a location and general
description of the site indicating:

     ** Estimated oil content is resulting soil mix (if oil-
        based).
     ** Present land use, topography, vegetation type,
        soil horizon used for disposal, topsoil depth, and size
        of disposal area.
     ** Measures used to contain surface and subsurface
        migration of contaminants.
     ** Procedures, timing and frequency of the
        landfarming operation and depth of initial
        incorporation into the soil.
     ** Schedule for any waste-soil mixture cultivation
        or tilling.
     ** Type of soil amendments which may be used to
        promote biodegradation.
     ** Analytical tests and sampling locations which
        will be used to determine initial soil-waste quality, and
        to monitor hydrocarbon degradation and salt levels.
     ** Time required to complete the landfarming
        procedure and the criteria used to determine when
        completion reached.
     ** Proximity to residents other than the landowner.
     ** Name and telephone number of person
        responsible for the disposal operation.

     If the well is to be located on public land, the waste
disposal plan will be reviewed by either the Agriculture
Dept.; Food, and Rural Development; or the
Environmental Protection Dept. The plan for wells
drilled on private land will be reviewed by ERCB's
Environment Protection Dept. The plan must be
approved before the operator can spud the well.
     According to ERCB, the purpose of the plan is to
make sure the operator "has considered the long-term
soil reclamation steps required when producing a
particular waste type," and to determine where and
how these treatments are being used in the province.

DOE seeks input to production strategy

     The Energy Dept. is asking for input from oil and
gas producers as it prepares a domestic oil and gas
initiative to create jobs and increase domestic
production while protecting the environment.
     Speaking at a recent oil and gas waste management
seminar sponsored by the Independent Oil & Gas
Assn. of Pennsylvania, Nancy Johnson, a DOE
program manager for environmental research and
analysis, urged operators to comment on the initiative.
     DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary announced the
project in April; the agency hopes to complete its draft
strategy for submission to President Clinton by Labor
Day.
     Johnson acknowledged oil and gas operators face
increasing environmental costs and liabilities
stemming from a constant flow of new and more
complex regulations. She stressed the importance of
basing policy analysis on cumulative regulatory
impact.
     For example, a DOE study determined the
industrial waste provisions proposed in a Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act bill last year would
have resulted in a 9% decrease in oil reserves, a 3%
decrease in gas reserves, the loss of 13,000 exploration
and production jobs, a $27 billion decrease in federal
and state tax revenues and would cost industry $40
billion initially plus $5 billion annually for compliance.
     Johnson said DOE wants to hear from industry
what it considers priority concerns, regional issues,
research needs, and innovative ideas for problem
solving through federal, state and industry co-
operation.
     Meanwhile, about three-quarters of DOE's
requested $101 million for natural gas programs is
aimed at utilizing fuel cells ($50 million), advanced
turbines ($24 million) and other uses ($5 million).
Also proposed is some $17 million for resource and
extraction programs, $3.4 million for delivery and
storage, and $2.9 million for environmental research
and analysis.
     The proposed $80 million petroleum budget targets
$70 million for oil recovery programs and $3.6 million
for environmental research and analysis.
     Comments for the domestic oil and gas strategy
should be directed to Len Coburn, Office of Oil and
Natural Gas Policy (EP-52); or Donald Juckett, Office
of Fossil Energy (FE-30), Dept. of Energy, 1000
Independence Ave. SW, Washington, D.C. 20585.

Twenty-five operators fined $130,800

     The Texas Railroad Commission racked up another
$130,800 in fines over the last two weeks as it charged
25 oil and gas operators with violations of commission
well plugging and pollution rules.
     So far in 1993, the commission has levied
$1,312,401.32 in fines, compared to only $543,666 in
such penalties assessed during the same period last
year.
     The following operators were fined for single well
violations: Atlantic & Gulf Pet Corp. of Houston
($3,000), Hash Oil Co. of Albany ($3,000), RCB
Record Co. of San Antonio ($3,000), Kevin Franks
Enterprises of Morton ($3,000), Seagull Resources of
Calgary, Alberta ($3,500), and Trinity Valley Oil &
Equipment of Houston ($3,000).
     Two companies were cited for two-well violations.
Sonora Oil Co. of Rockwall was ordered to pay
$3,000, and Global Energy & Minerals of Houston
was penalized $5,000.
     Dohn Operating of Ganado was fined $20,000 for
four inactive and unplugged wells; Red River
Hydrocarbons of Scottsdale, Ariz. was assessed
$9,000 for four wells; and Gene Creswell of Graham
was assessed $15,000 for five wells.
     In addition, M-P Petroleum Inc. of Houston was
ordered to pay $3,500 for discharges of oil and gas
wastes; Deryl G. Bolin of Carrizo Springs was fined
$1,500 for an unplugged well and for an oil spill;
Diamond S Operating of Livingston was ordered to
pay $4,000 for an unplugged well and for failing to
backfill pits; Kana Resources of Snyder was assessed
$6,000 for oil and saltwater discharges; and
Goldenwest Oil Co. of Olney was fined $24,500 for
10 inactive and unplugged wells and for oil and
saltwater discharges.
     Nine operators agreed to pay a penalty without
admitting any violation of commission rules. Claude
Robinson Oil & Gas of Borger was assessed $800 for
eight unplugged wells; Keystone Operating Co. of

SVE leads in EPA market survey

     An EPA report coming out soon projects the
volume of contaminated soil amenable to soil vapor
extraction at 2 1/2 times the amount that could be
subjected to in situ bioremediation.
     Soil vapor extraction has been used in 17% of
cleanup treatment remedies applied so far but is still
considered innovative because information on meeting
cleanup targets is hard to get. It's a lot easier to track
what's been removed than what's left behind.
     So said Walter Kovalick, head of EPA's 4-year-old
Technology Innovation Office in Superfund and an
acting deputy administrator for solid waste and
emergency response. He described the new report last
week at a conference in St. Paul, Minn. The report, 2
1/2 years in the making, projects market share in
volumes of soil to be treated by various innovative
technologies during the next five to eight years.
     For example, the soil vacuum extraction (SVE)
market was put at 3.2 million cubic yards, in situ
bioremediation at 1.2 million cubic yards, in situ soil
flushing at 980,000 cubic yards, and soil washing at
840,000 cubic yards. Kovalick said bioremediation has
been lagging, while soil flushing and soil washing
have been moving up.
     The market survey focuses on 550 sites at the
remedial design stage and 738 that are going through
the remedial investigation and feasibility study process.
     Contamination volumes were aggregated from sites
in various cleanup programs: Superfund, 1,600 to
2,000 sites (including 400 to 800 in the discovery or
listing part of the process); RCRA corrective action,
3,500; underground storage tanks, 295,000; Defense
Dept., 7,313; Energy Dept., 4,000; other federal
agencies, 350.
     Although no information was available on the
number of state sites, Kovalick said states had spent
$428 million and have cleanup fund balances of $2.2
billion.
accounted for 61% of thermal treatments.
     The report, Cleaning Up the Nation's Waste Sites:
Markets and Technical Trends, No. PB93-140762, will
be available from the National Technical Information
Service, 703-487-4650. T

OSPRA audits on schedule

     The Texas General Land Office says it has
completed about half its audits of coastal facilities that
have submitted oil spill contingency plans required by
the state's 1991 Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act
(OSPRA).
     GLO began the series of random audits in January
and to date its 22 inspectors have examined some 300
of the 600 oil-handling facilities scattered along the
Texas coastline from Louisiana to Mexico, including
production sites.
     Timothy McKinna, who is in charge of the land
office's spill division, said the random audits will likely
be completed by the end of August. He told E&PE
about 100 facilities have passed inspection and been
certified by the agency; the remainder are in the
process of making changes to their plans to bring them
into line.
     McKinna said companies' compliance with the
requirements of OSPRA has improved as the audits
have progressed. "When we began random on-site
audits in January, we discovered a variety of problems
that made plans that looked good on paper unworkable
in reality," he said. "Some of the plans were so
cumbersome that personnel would never have the
inclination to study them, much less understand them."
     If an operator doesn't have a workable contingency
plan in place, the way in which the land office conducts
the audits doesn't provide much opportunity to cobble
one together. GLO auditors normally give an operator
only about an hour's notice that they're coming to
conduct the inspection.

1992 saw record EPA fines

     The filing of criminal charges against
environmental polluters is the fastest growing
component of EPA's enforcement efforts, an agency
report says.
     EPA's just released Enforcement
Accomplishments Report for Fiscal Year 1992 says
the year saw record fines levied for both civil and
criminal environmental violations. The report credits
the growth of criminal enforcement to the new resident
agent offices opened in Houston, Los Angeles,
Buffalo, N.Y., St. Louis, and Miami.
     To order a copy of the report, call EPA's Public

Correction

     In the May 14 issue, E&PE incorrectly stated
Colorado surface owners were asking that the state Oil
and Gas Conservation Commission raise the surface
damage bond of Gerrity Oil & Gas Corp.       Instead,
the case involved wells being drilled by Elk
Exploration. Gerrity has no applications pending for a
surface damage bond increase before the commission.
     The case was heard in part at the commission's
April meeting and continued until its June hearing.
After more than 10 hours of hearings, the commission
recommended a bond in the amount of $15,250
(E&PE 6/11).
     Covering three wells, the per well bond amount is
$5,083, or $83 more than the standard $5,000 required
for a single well by the commission's rules.

Controversial well draws ire

     The comment period for a Bureau of Land
Management draft environmental impact statement
favorable to the drilling of a controversial proposed
exploratory well in South Florida has been extended 90
days to Aug. 18.
     Shell Oil wants to drill a 18,850-foot directional
wildcat on the Miccosukee Indian reservation under the
everglades in Broward County.
     The project has drawn the fire of environmentalists
and state and local officials because the Biscayne
aquifer, the region's main underground water supply,
begins within five miles of the proposed well. Shell
says the well will not affect the aquifer, but
environmentalists maintain it will.
     The Florida Legislature and South Florida Water
Management Board have passed resolutions calling on
both the BLM and Bureau of Indian Affairs, the two
federal agencies charged with reviewing and approving
the EIS, to kill the plan. In addition, Broward County
commissioners passed a resolution threatening a
lawsuit if the well is approved. If approved by both
agencies, the final EIS will probably be published next
February or March.
     Anticipation of a discovery of hydrocarbons by the
well is low. So far, only 14 of 202 exploratory wells in
South Florida have produced oil or gas, and the only
well drilled in Broward County was a duster.
     For a copy of the draft EIS, contact Robert Abbey,
District Manager, Bureau of Land Management, 411
Briarwood Dr., Suite 404, Jackson, Miss. 39206, or

Edwards signs oilfield bill

     Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards has signed into
law the Oilfield Restoration Act to clean up E&P sites
statewide.
     Heavily supported by oil and gas interests, the law
levies a fee of 1"/barrel on oil and a 0.2"/mcf of
natural gas produced in the state, with a $10/yr charge
for non-producing wells.
     Levied at the wellhead, the fees will be collected in
the same way as the state's severance tax, using
monthly producer payments. The money will go into
the Oilfield Site Restoration Trust Fund, and will
finance the reclamation of about 2,000 known
orphaned and abandoned sites in Louisiana.
Temporarily abandoned or saltwater disposal wells in
stripper fields are exempt.
     There is a $10 million ceiling and a $6 million floor
on the fund; it's expected to generate $4-5 million in its
first year. The fund will be administered by a
commission made up of the Natural Resources Dept.
secretary and six others who will be selected by Gov.
Edwards from industry and environmental
organizations.

Environmental patents

     M.M. Francis and T.R. Jack have patented a
process for biodegradation of oily waste in a passively
aerated bioreactor that contains a porous, substantially
oleophilic matrix, such as peat. The process may be
used to treat the types of oily wastes conventionally
disposed of in landfarming operations. The technique
provides the potential to reduce the loss of leachates
and to control the loss of volatiles (Canadian Patent
No. 2,032,610).
     F.D. Rowsell has patented a method for collecting
and recovering oil spills in water. The spills are treated
with amine-substituted water-swelling clays added to
the spill in amounts that herd oil into islands separated
by surfaces of water containing no oil. The clays can
also be added to oil spills in an amount that produces
quasi-solid, buoyant organoclay-oil flocculate clumps
that float in the water and can be collected from the
surface (U.S. Patent No. 5,176,831).
     J.B. Rodden of Shell Oil Co. has patented a system
for removal and disposal of minor amounts of
organics from contaminated water. The process uses a
pump to feed water from the body of contaminated
water to the system, where indirect heat exchange and
direct steam addition raises its temperature. A stripping
vessel uses gas to strip the heated water and remove
the volatile contaminants (U.S. Patent No. 5,176,798).

EPA to update regs

     EPA is proposing to update a portion of the outer
continental shelf air regulations for the OCS lying
offshore Southern California.
     Appearing in the June 18 issue of the Federal
Register (58 FR 33589), the notice says the portions of
the OCS air regs that are being updated relate to the
requirements for OCS sources for which the Santa
Barbara Air Pollution Control District, Ventura County
APCD and San Luis Obispo APCD are the
corresponding onshore areas. Deadline for comments
is July 19.
     The 1990 Clean Air Amendments require EPA to
periodically update the requirements applying to OCS
sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward
boundaries to keep them consistent with the
requirements of the corresponding onshore areas
(E&PE 9/4/92).
     Comments on the update should be mailed (in
duplicate if possible) to EPA Air Docket (A-5), Attn:
Docket No. A-93-16, Environmental Protection
Agency, Air and Toxics Division, Region 9, 75

Alberta mulls new well fee

     Alberta regulators are considering imposing a one-
time fee on first-time drillers in the province and
applying the proceeds to restoration of orphan
wellsites.
     The Energy Resources Conservation Board says
the C$10,000 fee would go into a fund to be used to
return orphan wells in Alberta to an environmentally
acceptable state. Operators with a history of drilling in
Alberta will not pay the fee, but any newly formed
company or any operating in the province for the first
time will be subject to the charge.
     Operators now pay a C$500 well licensing fee
along with an orphan well surcharge of C$40 for every
well suspended in 1992. For 1993, this surcharge was
increased to C$60/well.
     The ERCB has identified some 17 orphan wells to
date. Costs for each well vary, depending on the
amount of work needed to properly abandon and clean
up a site.
     The C$10,000 fee is still in the proposal stage, and
is not expected to become standard procedure prior to
this summer. However, while Alberta has some 700
oil and gas companies registered in the province, an
estimated 3,000 companies own all or part of various
Alberta wells.
     This leads to difficulty in tracking down some
owners, and officials believe this is exactly the kind of
problem the new orphan well fee could help alleviate.

EPA issues PM-10 rule

     EPA has issued the final rule revising the
maximum allowable increase for particulate matter
under the requirements for prevention of significant
deterioration (PSD) of air quality.
     Published in the June 3 issue of the Federal
Register (58 FR 31622), the revisions affect the
regulations in 40 CFR parts 51 and 52 which specify
the increments for particulate matter with a diameter of
10 micrometers (PM-10) or less.
     The effective date for the rule varies. For the federal
PSD program, the implementation date is June 3,
1994. For EPA-approved state PSD programs, the
rule goes into effect on the date when the state's revised
program, containing the new increments, is approved
by EPA.

Expanded UIC regs opposed

     An expansion of the underground injection control
regulations proposed by EPA has drawn criticism by
independent operators.
     The Federal Advisory Committee is considering the
draft rule being prepared to cover construction
requirements for Class 2 wells under the Safe
Drinking Water Act.
     The rule seeks to expand the area of review
requirements to all wells, increase specific well
construction requirements, and would mandate
increased mechanical integrity testing.
     The expanded requirements were proposed as
safeguards to protect drinking water contamination
from injected oil and gas wastes. Trade groups like the
Independent Petroleum Assn. of America and
Pennsylvania's Independent Oil & Gas Assn. contend
the changes are unwarranted and would be particularly
burdensome to smaller producers.
     They say studies by the Government Accounting
Office and American Petroleum Institute found only
four cases of aquifer contamination from the nation's
170,000 active injection wells and 2.2 million
abandoned or inactive wells.
     The economic estimate provided in the draft rule
forecasts that up to 65% of the total $124 million
compliance costs for the first five years would fall
disproportionately on "small entities" such as stripper
operations concentrated in geographical areas like
Appalachia.
     The independents also point to a 1987 EPA report
to Congress that concluded strippers constitute a
special subcategory of the oil and gas industry that
should be considered independently and which
warrants special regulatory actions tailored to their
operation.
     Barry Russell, IPAA vice president and general
counsel, told E&PE industry has urged EPA to "go
back to the drawing board and recalculate the energy
and cost impacts of any UIC program changes."

Global Cooperation on Climate Change:  Experts Recommend Paths to
Effective Action

     This year will mark the beginning of formal negotiations
toward an international framework convention on climate change.
Protocols to add specific and binding targets will follow, or may
even accompany the convention.  What lessons can we learn from
previous agreements?  What obstacles will negotiators face?  Is a
global agreement likely to be effective, or could regional
agreements and unilateral actions be stronger in the short term?
To help answer these questions, GECR spoke with some of the
leading figures in the current drive to define the elements of a
convention on climate change.
     The 1985 Vienna Convention on Protection of the Ozone Layer,
and the subsequent Montreal Protocol, are widely seen as models
for future global environmental agreements.  The Vienna
Convention (which itself was partially modeled after the 1977
Barcelona Convention) was established as an interim agreement
when it became apparent that a specific protocol would not yet
have wide support; however it was a definite, formal statement of
commitment by governments to future action on the ozone depletion
problem.  The Montreal Protocol, signed two years later, added
legally binding deadlines for the reduction of ozone-depleting
chemicals.
     This two-step process (convention followed by protocol) was
necessary for the ozone treaty, but should the same procedure be
followed for a climate change agreement?  Why not aim for an
accord that includes protocols, particularly one on CO2?  "I
think that will delay it," says Ambassador Richard Benedick, the
chief US negotiator of the Montreal Protocol, now on detail from
the US State Department as senior fellow of the Conservation
Foundation/World Wildlife Fund in Washington, DC. "People aren't
ready for a protocol [on CO2], and I think you have to go through
a process to get there.  I believe in partial solutions -- in
fact, the Montreal Protocol is already a partial solution for
climate change -- and we ought to disaggregate rather than
complexify.  The framework convention could have some teeth, but
we shouldn't try to cram it up with too much.  It will load down
the convention, and we'll never finish it.  I'd rather go step by
step."
     A framework convention will be difficult enough to negotiate
(the current goal is to have a convention ready for signature at
the UN's Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992),
but producing the relevant protocols could prove an even greater
challenge.  As Benedick points out, we already have one
greenhouse gas treaty in the Montreal Protocol, but creating an
agreement that can reduce carbon dioxide worldwide while still
serving the short- and long-term interests of developed and
developing countries will test the limits of the parties'
diplomacy, cooperation, and patience.  Carbon dioxide carries far
more economic and political weight than CFCs ever could.
     Some observers are concerned that a truly effective
international agreement to limit carbon dioxide emissions won't
be signed by more than a handful of countries.  According to
Michael Grubb of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in
London, UK, a treaty with any given reduction target would prove
relatively easy for parties like the US and the USSR to comply
with:  neither currently uses energy efficiently, and they have
many options available to reduce emissions.  But Japan or France,
which are already quite energy-efficient in terms of CO2
emissions, might argue against such "equal reduction" targets
because it would be unfairly expensive for them to take emissions
down another percentage.  Thus, any agreement based on equal
reductions could result in a "lowest common denominator"
compromise, which may not be strong enough to address the problem
of global emissions.  Richard Benedick says this becomes less of
a problem if the treaty establishes a retroactive baseline year
for emission levels back to the mid-eighties, for example, so
countries can credit their existing energy-efficiency policies
toward the targeted levels.  Still, setting that baseline year
could be problematic:  Japan began major measures to reduce
emissions in the 1970s.  Do we want to go back that far?
     This example merely hints at the complexity of establishing
targets that a majority of countries will accept.  And once goals
are established, ways to achieve and enforce them must still be
settled.  A number of agencies, groups, and individuals are
currently analyzing carbon taxes (domestic and international),
leasable or tradeable emission permits, and other regulatory or
incentive options, to see which ones might be most effective and
politically feasible.
     The idea of a Law of the Atmosphere is gaining some support,
although as Peter Faross of the European Commission headquarters
in Brussels explained to GECR, "a lot of countries are very
sensitive when you try to touch on their sovereignty rights.  And
the broad and ambitious approach of a full-fledged law for the
atmosphere might be a very time-consuming process.  You may
arrive at the point where it's too late to implement the
necessary action because the discussions would last too long."
The unsigned Law of the Sea stands in testimony to the political
unpopularity of international control systems.
     Peter Thacher, former deputy executive director of the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and assistant
secretary general of the UN, who now works with the World
Resources Institute in Washington, DC, says that the appropriate
way toward international cooperation on the global warming issue
is through a comprehensive action plan, much like the "Action
Plan to Protect Stratospheric Ozone" that UNEP developed for
governments in 1977.  An action plan for climate change would
contain a legal chapter, calling for negotiation and early
adoption of a framework convention and the first of several
protocols to deal with individual greenhouse gases, such as CO2.
The plan would also have a scientific chapter to implement --
with heavy involvement of the International Geosphere-Biosphere
Program -- the intensified research and monitoring that is needed
to help bring other greenhouse gases under international control.
This calls for an additional chapter to ensure that international
mechanisms and funding are adequate to mount a stronger global
research effort.  "These funds are needed today," Thacher says,
"and should not be delayed until treaties are ready."
     Thacher acknowledges that negotiating international
conventions and protocols could take time.  What about other
actions in the meantime?  "I think the `big boys' ought to tackle
this on their own, unilaterally taking steps in their own
self-interest," Thacher told GECR.  The industrialized nations
have their own organs, such as the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), to do this if they want to
avoid using the UN.  "They can all benefit by looking at policy
implications of improving energy efficiency.  I think that ought
to get started without waiting for a package deal in which the
developed countries are involved.  They ought to get started
because that's where the big CO2 cutbacks can be achieved in the
shortest time."
     Michael Grubb takes a similar view: "You have to ask
seriously whether you really need to get all countries involved
at this stage, and you may well conclude that you can do more
with less:  70% of global carbon emissions are produced by the
US, Europe (East and West), and the USSR, so you may get
something useful from a more limited number of countries."  Grubb
stresses that global participation is ultimately necessary, but
notes that unilateral, bilateral, and regional efforts could be
important stepping stones on the way toward that goal.
     Conversations with sources at the OECD and the European
Commission indicate that neither body expects to develop
agreements among its members apart from the UN's global treaties,
but both are working on climate change issues on their own and
through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The OECD will hold a meeting in late January among its member
countries to discuss the questions they will need to consider
when they develop climate change policies.  The discussions
should help OECD countries work out some of their differences in
order to facilitate the formal IPCC negotiations.  The
International Energy Agency (IEA) and the OECD are collaborating
on an energy and greenhouse gas "outlook" up to the year 2005,
which will provide the basis for evaluation in 1990 of the
potential for and costs of specific sectoral actions to reduce
emissions.  And the European Commission is creating a coherent
energy saving program called SAFE, which it expects to release
this year.
     The IPCC will present the elements of a framework convention
at the Second World Climate Conference (29 October - 7 November
1990); formal negotiations will begin then or shortly thereafter.
Cooperation will be hard-won, but essential.  In his 1968 essay,
"The Tragedy of the Commons," Garrett Hardin wrote that "we are
locked into a system of `fouling our own nest,' so long as we
behave only as independent, rational, free-enterprisers." If we
knowingly choose not to abandon free enterprise and rationality,
then to avoid the tragedy of the global commons we must
compromise some of our independence.  Global solutions will take
time and will be imperfect, but in the end, it seems they'll be
the ones that matter.

United Nations Confirms 1992 World Conference on Environment

     In late December, the 44th session of the United Nations
General Assembly formally approved a proposal to go forward with
the long-planned World Conference on Environment and Development
to be held in Brazil in 1992.  The conference, which will be the
second UN-sponsored world meeting on the environment (the first
was held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972), is expected to last two
weeks, and will be timed to coincide with World Environment Day
(5 June, 1992).  An open-ended preparatory committee, based in
the UN General Assembly, will meet five times to plan the
conference, with the first meeting planned for March 1990 in New
York.  The committee will hold its subsequent meetings in Geneva
and Nairobi, with a final meeting in New York to solidify plans.
     During the UN session, developed and developing countries
had to negotiate the locations of the planning meetings, as well
as which body of the UN would be responsible for planning the
conference.  Industrialized countries originally favored the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as the appropriate
planning group, with meetings to occur in Geneva.  Developing
countries objected to this choice on the grounds that they are
not well represented in Geneva, and they felt that their needs
would be better served by a planning committee drawn from the
General Assembly.

CFC Taxes Now in Effect in US

     As of 1 January 1990, US producers and importers of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) must pay a base tax of $1.37 per pound
of chemical, with adjustments according to the particular
chemical's ozone depleting potential.  Importers of products
manufactured with the use of CFCs (such as automobiles,
electronic equipment, refrigerators, etc.) are subject to the
tax, which will be passed on to consumers.  The tax was
originally sponsored by Representative Peter Stark (Democrat,
California), and was incorporated in the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1989.  The Internal Revenue Service
released initial guidelines on 22 December; final regulations
have not yet been issued.
     The base tax will rise incrementally, with an increase to
$1.67 per pound in 1992, jumping to $2.65 per pound the following
year.  From 1995 on, the rate will increase by $.45 annually.
Halons, recycled CFCs, CFCs used for manufacturing rigid foam
insulation, and CFCs used as feedstocks (i.e., entirely consumed
in the process of producing another chemical) are not currently
covered by the law.  Manufacturers of CFCs and halons for export
are exempt unless they surpass their current level of exports, in
which case they must either pay the tax or apply to the
Environmental Protection Agency for new allowances.  Halon and
rigid foam manufacturers will pay the full tax beginning in 1994,
but are required to pay a reduced base rate ($.25/pound) from
1991 until then.  US companies can still produce ozone-depleting
chemicals outside the US without paying the tax, so long as the
chemicals are not imported into the US.
     Floor stocks are covered by the tax in cases where inventory
is being held for sale or for use in further manufacture.
Companies (defined by employer identification number) that hold
total floor stocks of less than 400 pounds are exempt from this
tax.  The GECR Document Service will provide all relevant
documents (legislation, IRS guidance, a list of products subject
to the tax, etc.).  Call the GECR Hotline for more information,
at TEL: +1-617-648-8700.

China Releases Results of Afforestation Programs

     China has planted enough trees in its northern provinces
over the past 12 years to increase forest cover by over 25
million hectares (250,000 square kilometers), according to a
Chinese official news agency report released 5 December 1989.
The country began the afforestation program in 1977 to "harmonize
the development of agriculture, forests, and animal by-products,
and to control sand expansion."  Grain production in areas now
protected by trees has risen 10% - 30%, and grassland in the
region has increased by 20%.
     According to the report, 16.5 million hectares (165,000
square kilometers) of forest were planted by airplane, with the
rest planted manually.  The report states that total forest
coverage in the 13 northern provinces has increased to slightly
more than 7%, up from 5% in 1977.  China plans to spend "several
decades" constructing additional forest protection systems in the
region.
     Because the figures for the total afforested area seem high,
GECR checked Chinese-English translation of the figures with
several sources, but we were not able to get independent
confirmation of the areas from China.  According to World
Resources 1988-89, published by the World Resources Institute in
Washington, DC, "China has the world's largest reforestation
program, planting new forests at the rate of more than 4.5
million hectares per year."

Mexico City Improves Air Quality by Restricting Driving

     The government of Mexico City, in response to public concern
about winter air pollution levels, has implemented a program to
restrict driving in the Mexican capital from 20 November 1989
through 28 February 1990.  According to Ramon Ojeda, the city's
director of prevention and control of contamination, "each car in
the metropolitan area has to be idle one day a week from Monday
through Friday."
     Stickers, coded with a color specific to the day that a car
is not allowed on the road, have been affixed to license plates
on all city-registered vehicles (automobiles and
non-passenger-carrying trucks).  Cars from outside the city are
restricted based on the last digit of their plate number.
Weekends are unrestricted, as is the period from 10 pm to 5 am
every night.  Taxis and buses are not included in the program.
     According to Ojeda, Mexico City has 2,300,000 vehicles
registered, and the program has decreased the number of vehicles
on the road by over 400,000 per day.  Vehicles caught driving on
their restricted day are impounded and held for 24 hours.  Owners
must pay a fine equivalent to one month's minimum wage salary
(currently 380,000 pesos, or US $125.00) to recover their cars.
Since the program began, the city has issued 7,000 fines, which
Ojeda sees as a relatively low figure, and a sign that most
people are obeying the rules.  "The public has supported the
program enthusiastically, and there weren't any complaints,"
Ojeda told GECR.  "To the contrary, they want it to continue all
year."  The city's public transportation system seems to be
little affected by the program, since most people are electing to
car-pool.  Ojeda is enthusiastic about the program, saying that
"now the skies are clearer:  you can see the volcanoes."

Cairo Conference Sets New Tone of Cooperation Among Countries

     The World Conference on Preparing for Climate Change, held
in Cairo, Egypt from 17 - 21 December, 1989, set a new tone for
global cooperation, according to John Topping, president of the
Climate Institute in Washington, DC.  The conference was convened
by the Climate Institute, the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), and the government of Egypt, and was
co-sponsored by 20 international agencies and organizations.
     Conference participants released the "Cairo Compact," a
proclamation toward a concerted world-wide response to the
climate crisis, which recognizes among other things the
responsibility of all countries, including developing nations, to
take measures in their own self-interest to reduce emissions.
     This was the first major world conference on climate change
to be held in a developing country, and Topping told GECR that a
distinguishing feature of this conference was the strong sense of
cooperation and common purpose -- and a relative lack of the
"North-South" tensions that have tended to plague such meetings
in the past.  "The Egyptians set the tone, which allowed it to be
successful in creating a sense of global commitment," Topping
told GECR.  The proclamation was initially endorsed by developing
countries as well as the industrialized nations.
     The conference focused strongly on adaptive measures, "not
because emission control isn't critically important -- it is, and
we're obviously very concerned about it -- but the problem is
that a lot of the developing countries will be affected even under a
stringent emissions control scenario."  Topping says that the
conference helped underscore industrialized nations' concern for
the safety and welfare of people in developing countries, not
just concern about their emissions.

Scientists Lower Estimates of Potential Sea Level Rise

     Predictions of sea level rise of up to 1.5 meters by the
year 2100 are probably overestimates, according to studies
presented at a recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union
(AGU).  Over 4,000 scientists met in San Francisco, California,
USA, on 4 - 8 December 1989 to discuss a wide variety of topics,
including global warming and sea level rise.
     Thirty years of observations of the Antarctic ice sheet have
led Charles R. Bentley, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
Wisconsin, USA, to conclude that the polar ice cap may actually
be removing water from the sea, accounting for a sea level drop
of 5 mm per year.  Bentley believes that the short-term response
to global warming is increased snowfall over Antarctica as
warming air takes up and holds more water.  This snow
accumulation would outpace any melting of the ice sheet,
according to Bentley.  Bentley stresses the importance of viewing
the Antarctic ice sheet as a dynamic system that responds to
climate changes over long periods of time.
     Satellite observations by H. Jay Zwally of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight
Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA, show that the Greenland ice
sheet is thickening as a result of increased precipitation, and
Zwally suggests that the thickening will continue.  Research
conducted by Tad Pfeffer, Mark Meier, and Tissa Illangasekare, of
the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA, indicates
that meltwater runoff from arctic glaciers may take a significant
amount of time to reach the ocean as it refreezes while filling
in snowpack pores as deep as 50 meters.
     According to Meier, by the year 2050 -- the time atmospheric
CO2 is projected to double -- melting of small glaciers may have
contributed about 0.15 meters to sea level rise, thermal
expansion may contribute a 0.2 meter rise, and human factors
(such as pumping groundwater into the oceans) may contribute
another 0.2 meter rise.  Greenland would contribute a 0.08 meter
fall in sea level, and Antarctica would lower levels by an
additional 0.31 meter.  Meier cautioned that the picture is still
quite uncertain, but that "it's beginning to look now as if sea
rise will lag behind warming by a significant amount."

Researcher Documents Acid Precipitation's Effect on Spruce
Seedlings

     Acidic clouds that envelope high-elevation forests for up to
35% of the year in the eastern US can cause more severe damage to
trees than acid rain does, according to Jay Jacobson of the Boyce
Thompson Institute of Plant Research at Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York, USA.  The acid clouds have a pH of 3.5, several
times more acidic than acid rain, which has an average pH of 4.
The rising and lowering of the clouds over mountaintops causes
the acid measured on tree leaves to become concentrated to pH
levels as low as 2 as the water evaporates, Jacobson told GECR.
Jacobson studied the effects of acidified water vapor on red
spruce (Pinea rubens) seedlings, a species that dominates many
eastern US mountaintop forests.
     In greenhouse and field studies, Jacobson determined that
the effects of acidic mist depended on the relative
concentrations of sulfuric and nitric acid.  Acid precipitation
generally has a higher concentration of sulfuric acid than nitric
acid, along with small amounts of ammonium ions.  Sulfuric acid
alone was more damaging to needles by causing localized death of
plant tissue and premature loss of needles from the seedlings.
Nitric acid mist appeared to influence nutrient relationships by
increasing nitrogen levels and decreasing levels of calcium and
magnesium in the leaves.  However, sulfuric acid mist affected
the spruce needles at lower concentrations than did nitric acid,
Jacobson told GECR.
     Jacobson's research is part of the five-year federally
funded National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, which
involved more than 700 scientists and a half billion dollars in
research money.  Funding expires this year; Jacobson told GECR
that some of the work is unfinished and inconclusive, but he says
it is unlikely that federal funding for the program will be
renewed.

Antarctic Ozone Hole Broke Up Earlier Than Expected in 1989

     The 1989 Antarctic ozone hole got off to an earlier and
stronger start than the 1987 hole, but it started to break up a
month earlier than expected, according to Mark Schoeberl of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.  "The polar
vortex in 1989 began to break up in mid-to-late October; in 1987,
it held intact all the way through November," Schoeberl told
GECR.  The total amount of ozone "ended up going down to almost
exactly the same level as or perhaps slightly higher (by about 10
Dobson Units) than 1987."
     The breakup of the ozone hole is controlled by two major
factors, Schoeberl explained: one is the intrinsic resistance to
breakup of the ozone hole caused by the ozone reduction itself,
and the other is the nature of the forces that tend to break up
the polar vortices.  These forces are extremely variable from
year to year and are unpredictable.  A more active dynamical
stratosphere that would tend to break up the hole or prevent its
formation "generally goes with the QBO (the Quasi-Biennial
Oscillation, a switching of tropical winds from east to west that
occurs approximately every 27 months)," Schoeberl told GECR, "but
this year was an exception."  Normally, with an easterly QBO, the
ozone hole is not as deep, as was the case in 1988.  Tropical
winds were still easterly in 1989, but "the link was broken
between the QBO and the zonality of the flow."  The vortex flow
tended to follow east-west latitude lines in 1989, keeping the
polar stratosphere quiet enough to cause ozone depletion nearly
as great as in 1987's record-setting hole.  "Then we had a big
dynamical event in October and the hole started to break up."
When the polar vortex is disrupted, undepleted air comes into the
system and ozone levels begin to rise.

Tree-Ring Research Used in Study of Climate Change

     Scientists in the US, USSR, China, Argentina, New Zealand,
Canada, India, Australia, and Europe are studying the rings of
long-lived trees for clues to historic and prehistoric climate
change.  Certain species of trees can accurately indicate periods
of drought and temperature fluctuations, and may be used to
reconstruct past climate events and trends.
     Malcolm Hughes, Director of the University of Arizona's
Laboratory of Tree Ring Research in Tucson, Arizona, USA, is
studying the rings of giant sequoias as a potential climate
record.  The trees can grow to at least 2,600 years old, and they
show "a good drought signal," with extremely narrow rings in dry
years.  Sequoias can thus show the frequency of severe droughts
in the region surrounding the trees.
     Researchers have to select carefully the tree species and
the individuals sampled to ensure that the growth ring response
can be correlated to the parameter being studied.  "A bristlecone
pine at a high elevation has a different response than one at
lower elevations," David Meko of the Laboratory of Tree Ring
Research points out.  Long-lived trees are often few and far
between, and getting good spacial coverage of a particular
species can be a problem.  The tree ring record must be
calibrated with known instrumental records in order to be used
with confidence, which can prove difficult if records are scarce
for the parameter (soil temperature, rainfall, etc.) being
measured.
     Gordon Jacoby, of the Tree Ring Laboratory at Lamont-Doherty
Laboratory in New York, USA, says that his group has recently
reconstructed  northern hemisphere temperatures for a 300-year
period using tree rings, and the reconstruction shows a warming
trend within the last hundred years "that is unusual in the
context of the 300 year record."  Jacoby was able to sample many
individuals of the same species (white spruce) over almost 90
degrees of longitude.  "We covered about 25% of the circumpolar
area in a fairly homogeneous data set."  White spruce is limited
by thermal properties such as air temperature, ground
temperature, and soil temperature, and is moisture-stressed when
the active zone above the permafrost is extremely cold, reducing
the tree's ability to take up water.

Energy-Efficient Lights are Selling, But Producers Face
Challenges

     The market for compact fluorescent lamps, which have typical
life spans of 8,000 to 10,000 hours and can save users 75% or
more of the costs associated with standard incandescent bulbs, is
"growing at about 25% per annum," according to Vivienne Charrett
of Thorn Lighting in Enfield, UK.  Much of that growth can be
attributed to incentive programs by electric utilities, such as
rebate offers, options to lease rather than purchase expensive
light bulbs, and giveaways.  Carol O'Neill of Philips Lighting
Company's US division in Somerset, New Jersey, told GECR that
growth in sales can also be attributed to media attention,
efforts by environmental groups, and general concern about global
warming.  Still, O'Neill says that compact fluorescents, while
"experiencing explosive growth," represent a minute percentage of
overall lighting sales.
     Producers face a number of obstacles in their effort to
bring compact fluoresents to a wider market.  Amory Lovins,
director of research at the Rocky Mountain Institute in Old
Snowmass, Colorado, USA, says that "we need to decouple
utilities' profits from their sales so they will no longer be
rewarded for selling more electricity, nor penalized for selling
less.  And when they do something smart to cut your bill, they
need to be allowed to keep part of the savings as extra profit."

     Other concerns, according to Lovins, include a lack of
properly trained installation technicians, the fact that no one
currently provides retrofit components in bundled packaging,
limited competition in certain areas (central Europe, Australia,
New Zealand) that allows manufacturers to sell at excessive
markups, and the need for more imaginative marketing.  "I haven't
yet seen any compact fluorescent manufacturer go for the green
market by pointing out that each lamp takes a ton of CO2 out of
the air over its life [when compared with other lamps]," Lovins
told GECR.
     Energy-efficient lamps appear to be selling better overall
in Europe and the UK than the US.  Vivienne Charrett of Thorn
claims this is due to the cost of energy: "The country with the
least penetration of compact fluorescents is France, where the
cost of energy is exceptionally low."  Fred Steinmeyer of Osram
in Munich, West Germany agrees, saying that Europe recognized the
need to save energy earlier than the US.  Dick Dowhan of GTE
confirms that the difference could be attributed to Europe's
early start on the market, but he also cited Europe's 220-volt
system as a reason:  customers don't notice as much of a
difference between incandescents and compact fluorescents as
Americans do.  Amory Lovins says, "I don't think it has much to
do with electricity price.  I think it's a function of utility
participation, and least-cost-planning or an equivalent process."

UK Residential Investment in Energy-Saving Equipment Drops 12% in
1989

     The British government's scrapping of numerous
energy-efficiency programs in the past two years has directly
affected domestic purchases of energy-saving  equipment,
according to Andrew Warren of the London-based Association for
the Conservation of Energy (ACE).  Using sales figures from
relevant trade associations, ACE found that residential
investment in energy-saving products dropped significantly in
1989, down 12% from already declining 1988 levels.
     Purchases of weatherstripping (draft proofing) were down
15%; double-glazed windows dropped nearly 20%; and economical
heating equipment (energy-efficient boilers, thermostatic
radiator valves, etc.) declined by 6%, with Warren forecasting a
12% drop.
     Warren points out that the cutting of incentives and
education programs for energy efficiency directly conflicts with
UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's stated commitment to fight
global warming.  "The policies are going in the wrong direction,"
Warren told GECR, "and Thatcher's own government's submission to
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that if
present trends in the UK continue, we will see CO2 emissions
leaping.  We're currently at 579.3 billion tons a year; we're
likely to see rises of 29% - 34% across the next 15 years, and up
to 48% - 58% in 30 years."

General Motors Displays Advanced Electric Car

     General Motors Corporation, the world's largest automobile
manufacturer, has unveiled a sophisticated electric car that can
accelerate from 0 - 60 miles per hour (0 - 96 km/h) in eight
seconds, and can run for 120 miles (192 km) at highway speeds
without charging the batteries.  Recharging can be accomplished
in several hours by plugging into a conventional wall socket.
The prototype vehicle, called the "Impact," could be on the
market by the mid-1990s, but several problems must first be
overcome:  operating costs of the vehicle are currently about
twice those for gasoline-powered cars because the entire battery
pack must be replaced (at a cost of US $1,500) every 20,000 miles
(32,000 km).  The company has also not yet tested the vehicle's
crash-worthiness.
     Spokesmen for General Motors claim that given adequate
demand, the purchase price of the sporty-looking car would be
similar to gasoline-powered vehicles in its class.  The company
hopes to improve the life of the battery pack to bring operating
costs down to those of conventional cars.  If the vehicle is
exported from the US to countries where fuel prices are taxed, or
if US fuel prices rose, the "Impact" could prove to be less
expensive to operate than gasoline-powered models.
     Electric cars are a mixed answer to threats of global
warming:  while they do not burn fossil fuels themselves, the
vehicles generally use utility-generated electric power to
recharge.  Still, a recent report prepared by the University of
California at Berkeley, California, USA, suggests that an
all-electric vehicle fleet could reduce CO2 emissions by up to
43%, depending on the mix of energy sources used by utilities and
the efficiency of the vehicles themselves.  Other alternatives
exist:  Solar powered cars are already in use in Europe, and a
number of companies and independent groups are developing
versions for the US market.  GECR will report on these and other
alternative-fueled vehicles (such as hydrogen-powered cars) in
future issues.

Carrier Introduces CFC Recycling Unit for Large Chillers

     Carrier Corp. of Syracuse, New York, USA, has developed a
refrigerant recovery and recycling system specifically designed
to handle large-scale commercial chillers.  The company will sell
the equipment, called the Refrigeration Management System (RMS),
worldwide to building owners when they purchase new centrifugal
chillers from Carrier, and to owners of existing commercial
air-conditioning units.
     The RMS units come in two sizes:  one will handle 1,600
pounds (720 kg) of CFCs and the larger unit has a capacity of
3,300 pounds (1485 kg).  Carrier spokesmen advise that the price
range for the equipment will be from US $6,000 - $12,000.  The
recycling unit draws a vacuum of 25 inches (62 cm).  For more
information, contact Rick Whitmyre at Carrier Corp., TEL:

US EPA Proposes New Controls on Municipal Waste Incinerators

     On 30 November, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposed new controls on municipal waste incinerators that would
trap five times more dusty particulates than currently required,
along with 90 to 95% of sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid, and
97% to 99% of airborne metals, such as lead and mercury.  The new
proposal also requires "tail gas" cleaning of nitrogen oxides,
which contribute to smog and acid rain, on those incinerators
which process more than 250 tons of trash daily.  This is
expected to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions by 40%.  These
new standards are expected to reduce 90% of the air pollutants by
1994, a reduction of more than a quarter million tons annually,
according to Robin Woods at EPA.
     The proposal requires monitoring and verification of
emissions by trained and certified supervisors.  By 1993, plants
would also be required to recycle 25% of the trash they process.
If approved, the new rules would be applied directly to the 150
incinerators that will be constructed at 60 US facilities in the
next five years, with the 450 incinerators currently in operation
at 200 plants being given several years to make the necessary
improvements.  Dave Ryan at the EPA told GECR that it may be a
full year before this proposal is approved and instituted.
     Woods estimates the national costs associated with the
proposed standards for new facilities to be $190 million
annually, which represents an increase of $13 per ton of
incinerated trash from the current $60 per ton.  It would cost
$320 million a year nationally to improve existing facilities, an
increase of $12 per ton.  In both cases, this translates to an
increase of $20 per year per household.  Public hearings will be
held in Boston on 22-23 January, Detroit on 25-26 January, and
Seattle on 30-31 January.  For more information on the public
hearings, call Ann Eleanor of the EPA at TEL: +1-919-541-5578.

Wind Power Plant Construction Expands in Midwest

In Minnesota, Northern Alternative Energy, Inc. of Minneapolis and
Micon Wind Turbines (U.S.) of Marshall are gearing up to expand the
Sibley, IA wind plant owned by IES Utilities, Inc.  When completed, 
the project will be the single largest turbine installation in the 
nation's midsection.

The first U.S.-made 600-kW Micon M1500-600/150 turbine will be
installed by Micon and NAE in Sibley, expanding the facility's
capacity to 925 kW from 325 kW.

The annual energy output of the plant is anticipated to top 1.8
million kWh after installation of the new turbine.  NAE president
Greg Jaunich said that this largest single turbine in the Midwest 
"should demonstrate to utilities in the region the benefits of 
large, industrial-sized wind turbines for electrical generation."

The nacelle and frame of the turbine were constructed by Micon and
Hutchinson Manufacturing Inc., which also assembled the generator
and its components.  Micon turbines are a Danish design.  The 
turbine, atop its 150-foot tubular tower, will be made by Thomas & 
Betts of Red Wing, MI.

European Commission Beefs Up Research Budget

Mme. Edith Cresson, European Commissioner for Research, Education 
and Training recently proposed 318 research and development projects
that have been approved by the EC as the European Community's 
participatory offering following the Fourth Framework Convention 
meeting on climate change.

Addressed will be ozone depletion, global warming, floods,
earthquakes, contaminated land and sustainable development.  The
Environment and Climate program will fund the research.

The Environment and Climate program has a budget of ECU 532 million,
which represents 4.3 percent of total Fourth Framework Program
funding covering 1994-1998.  Research to understand basic mechanisms 
of climate and other natural systems and how they impact natural 
resources will be performed.

Technologies will also be developed to monitor, protect and
rehabilitate as well as to conduct risk assessment.  Satellite
systems for earth observation and environmental research play a 
large part in the research.

Past climatic changes and dynamics will receive increased attention
to help understand current weather patterns.  The EPICA projects
will complement three successful Greenland ice cap projects by 
studying ice cores in Antarctica that will allow scientists to 
interpret earlier climate shifts over a half-million years.

Aerosols originating from dust, sea-spray, soot and suspended sulfur
dioxide are known to be important in the earth's energy balance.
Surrounded by cloud particles, they absorb radiation and also 
reflect it back into space.  Program ACE-2 will address the role of 
clouds and aerosols in the climate system and will also continue to 
look at processes of both natural and manmade aerosols.

Finns Push Coal at Expense of Nuclear Power

A radical overhaul of fuel taxation being undertaken by the Finnish
government could see a rise in construction of coal-fired power
plants at the expense of existing nuclear power.  Finland has agreed 
that it will not expand nuclear power generation nor build more 
nuclear-based power stations, a strategy that appears to argue for 
expanded coal-fired energy production.

The Finnish move will bring Finnish taxation more into line with
neighbors Sweden, Norway and Denmark which tax consumption, not
production, as has been the case in Finland.  The tax burden on 
coal- fired production will be reduced by an amount to be determined 
when the legislature meets this month.

Premier Paavo Lipponen told the legislature in December that the new
energy policy took into consideration the unpopularity of
nuclear-based production as well as the need for ways to improve 
coal- fired generation's cost-efficiency.

Lipponen had run for election based on promises of higher taxes on
coal and peat-fired plants, but the about-face, explains Antti
Kalliomaki, Finland's Trade and Industry minister, is because 
Swedish companies would like to export power into Finland because 
Finnish energy production costs have remained so much higher.

PORTUGAL HOPES EU LOAN FUNDING WILL SPARK MINI-HYDRO REVIVAL

Companies hope that a new European Union-backed government fund will
breathe new life into the mini-hydro power sector in Portugal, where
investment has been brought to a virtual standstill by falling
electricity prices, a shortage of funds and, mainly, lack of support
from municipal authorities.

Projects have received a welcome impetus in the shape of a Es1.1bn
($7.3m) loan from Programa Energia, a fund set up in mid-1995 to
promote the diversification, expansion and improvement of energy
production and use.

This first allocation of money from the fund goes to three companies
that are investing in four small hydro-electric generating plants with
a total capacity of just under 30 MW.

They are Hidrocorgo, Hidroerg and HDN-Energia do Norte. Another 36
similar projects are being evaluated by the Energia programme, which is
expected to mobilise a total investment of Es180bn, mainly focused on
stimulating natural gas use, as well as rational energy utilisation and
diversification into renewable energy resources.

Hidrocorgo is part of the Enersis group, the biggest mini-hydro
constructor and operator in Portugal, in which Midland Electricity
Board of the UK has a holding of about 35%. Enersis has so far
installed 50 MW in 15 mini-hydro plants.

Antonio Sa da Costa, head of Portugal's Water Resources Association,
told FTWB that since legislation permitting small-scale private energy
production was introduced in May 1988, mini-hydro generating plants
with a total capacity of 140 MW and involving investments totalling
Es30bn have been built in Portugal. Mini-hydro plants are defined as
having a maximum capacity of 10 MW.

The liberalisation led to a rush of project proposals and applications
for almost 1,000 licenses to build mini-hydros had been made by 1991.
However, by 1993 only 120 licenses had been granted. Sa da Costa says
many applications were for identical sites, others proved technically
or economically non-viable, and many prospective investors found that
their projects would be far more costly than they had anticipated.

Companies have also been discouraged from entering the sector by a 40%
drop in the price of electricity to industrial consumers from 1988 to
1993. Until recently, small producers sold energy to Electricidade de
Portugal, the state power utility, at rates based on industrial
tariffs. Partly because of this, new construction of mini-hydro plants
almost came to a halt after 1993, when funding from the European
Union's Valoren programme ended.

However, Sa da Costa says the biggest obstacle to investment in mini-
hydros is now a lack of support from municipal authorities and
opposition from local populations. "Mini-hydros are one of the most
environmentally-friendly means of producing energy," he says. "But a
lack of information has led to opposition to small hydro plants in many
Portuguese localities, by residents who fear, wrongly, that the plants
will damage their rivers."

The transfers of the approval of the water resource and public works
components of mini-hydros from a central body to local authorities has
put a further brake on expansion. Only one licence has been granted
since the change was made in February 1994. "Lack of information and
lack of support from water resource bodies are our biggest enemy," says
Sa da Costa.

Companies will be lobbying Portugal's new Socialist government for a
more supportive approach to licensing. Sa da Costas believes that this,
together with soft loans from the Energia programme, will stimulate
renewed investment in small-scale hydro-production.

Portugal's legislation was changed in November, moving it towards the
German model in the form of a commitment to pay producers of energy
from renewable sources higher rates than companies who produce energy
from fossil fuels. EDP's regulations have also been changed. Mini-hydro
producers were previously paid different rates according to the output
voltage of the energy they supplied. A single rate has now been
established at the top end of the previous scale.

A further 150 MW of mini-hydro capacity could be built by 1999.
Portugal's total possible capacity is estimated at 300-400 MW. Current
capacity accounts for 420 GWh a year - enough to supply about 600,000
domestic consumers - out of Portugal's total consumption of about 24
TWh. This saves the county an estimated Es2bn a year in oil bills.

Funds under the Energia programme are loaned at zero interest and have
to be paid back over 12 years. No repayments have to be made for the
first three years. Plants, costing an average of Es2bn-2.5bn, take a
maximum of two years to build. This means companies can pay back the
loans from the earnings of their generating plants.

SHOULD SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR DROUGHT CUTS?

The latest (proposed) tweak of the regulatory screw must leave the UK
water companies wondering what else they are to made liable for. In a
consultation document published on 20 December the economic regulator,
OFWAT, asks for comment on a suggested scheme of compensation payments
to customers suffering supply cuts as a result of drought.

OFWAT is responding to a government request for advice on compensation
issues raised by the 1995 drought. The Environment Secretary  sought
the advice in the face of the changed public attitude to water supply,
now seen increasingly as a pure money making operation rather than a
public service; a hostile response to supplier pleas for conservation
during the drought indicated that, now water supply is a commercial
operation, the customer expects no cuts, whatever the reason. Before
1989 the heads of the public water authorities would have had little
hesitation in pointing out that such expectations were unrealistic.
Provision for supplying water and for carrying away storm sewage is
based on an assessment of risks made from analysis of past rainfall
statistics. On the supply side the infrastructure is sized to guarantee
supplies for particular minimum annual rainfall conditions judged
likely to occur only once in a certain number of years. Storm sewers
are similarly designed for particular likely `return periods', in this
case looking at the maximum storm intensity and duration likely to be
encountered. In both cases more rare events could be catered for, but
with a corresponding increase in infrastructure cost.

It is only a little over a year since OFWAT concluded a detailed look
at company business plans and set price limits for the next five years.
Those limits are based on certain service standards specified in a
`Guaranteed Standards Scheme' (GSS). Suppliers are obliged to pay
compensation if any of the standards are breached and all of the items
covered, such as response times to account queries or consumer
complaints, are clearly within company control. Equally clearly
rainfall is outside company control and supply cuts caused by lack of
rain are not included in the GSS. Nevertheless the basic engineering
underlying supply infrastructure has a proven record - there have been
no supply cuts under Emergency Drought Orders in England and Wales
since 1976.

Surely this was a realistic way to look at service provision and, if
companies are now to be required to cater for more severe drought
conditions than allowed for in current business plans the new targets,
agreed by the economic and resources regulators, must first be clearly
stated? If companies were then obliged to guarantee supplies in
conditions of, say 75% rather than 80% of average long-term rainfall
they might reasonably be made liable to pay compensation, but only if
the requisite infrastructure was not provided. This might be done by
more provision for inter-company or inter-regional transfers rather
than from increased abstractions/infrastructure in the supply area
concerned.

Any open-ended liability for compensation may well provide, as the
consultation paper suggests, "....a powerful financial
incentive.......to balance the costs of resources against the costs of
(supply) restrictions," but, on the one hand the suggested daily
compensation payment of around #10 (based on average bills) seems
little enough for the inconvenience that some consumers might suffer;
on the other hand many might think that a rare inconvenience arising
from the vagaries of nature should not be disguised as something a
water company could have prevented.

This attitude was certainly apparent last summer when the water
companies collectively rejected an OFWAT suggestion of compensation on
the grounds that the weather conditions were exceptional. One or two
companies, not in areas threatened by supply cuts, later offered
compensation where heavy demand caused loss of supply pressure but,
according to the consultation paper, no suppliers have agreed that use
of rota cuts or standpipes forced by drought will constitute a reason
for compensation. That stance  was well judged - although such measures
have not been needed for nearly 20 years the trend in climate-induced
pressure on supplies can be seen from the 22-year record on hosepipe
bans. Bans on household use of hosepipes are an early step on the path
to conservation when drought conditions threaten. As the illustration
shows bans have been imposed on 10% or more of the population in 5 of
the last 7 years but in only 3 of the previous 15 years.

In commenting on another climate-induced supply problem over the
Christmas/New Year period the Socialist opposition spokesman on the
environment suggested that a higher staffing level in some companies in
the north-east of England might have produced a quicker response to
supply failures. He was talking about pipe bursts caused by
exceptionally low temperatures followed by a rapid swing to warmer
weather. Although the company pipes concerned will have been laid at
depths regarded as standard for forty or fifty years there was an
immediate public outcry accompanied by newspaper and radio reports
suggesting possible fault on the part of the suppliers. Will low
temperatures be next on the government list for a compulsory
compensation scheme?

* The principle recommendations in the consultation paper are :

Compensation payments of #10 per customer per day, up to a maximum of
#100, for drought-imposed rota cuts or standpipe supply for a day or
part day.

Compensation of #25 in any year for frequent poor pressure supplies
caused by drought conditions

An entitlement for business customers to claim compensation for losses
arising from the imposition of Drought Orders. (Changes needed to
primary legislation)

No general compensation for customers affected by hosepipe bans but
affected metered customers  may receive #25 per year compensation.

COMPANIES WAIT FOR RAIN AS DROUGHT FEARS PERSISTS

For suppliers and the resources regulator, the National Rivers
Authority (NRA), drought fears have persisted into the new year after
heavy rainfall in September failed to continue into the later autumn
and early winter. Perversely even the heavy rain that did occur missed
much of the area worst affected by low rainfall last summer. By mid-
December many soils were reported far from saturated and groundwater
recharge and reservoir refilling was declared minimal.

The NRA supplied a second resource status report* to the environment
minister in December. The report outlines the measures individual
companies must take during the coming months to reduce the risk of
supply interruptions next summer. A central theme is maximum
abstractions from rivers to replenish reservoirs during the hoped-for
wetter winter months, avoiding the need for environmentally damaging
over-abstraction in the lower flow periods of summer. Severn Trent is
currently involved in a Public Inquiry, facing protests from fishing
interests over proposed increased river abstractions. Yorkshire Water,
where some areas remain under real threat of imposed rota cuts, is also
subject to environmental protests over proposed abstraction increases.

The NRA report lists company estimates of the possible 1996 outcomes
assuming average and 80% of average rainfall. Only four of the ten
major utilities express confidence for uninterrupted supplies next
summer. It might have been more logical to report on a uniform known
risk, for example the minimum rainfall conditions likely to recur in
each supply region once in ten years. This would mean rainfall of 70%
of long term average in some areas and 90% in others. As it is the risk
of 80% normal winter rainfall in Anglian region is 1 in 5 years and in
the North East 1 in 16 years.

The speed at which the drought overtook England and Wales and the
adverse public reaction to enforced supply restrictions has shaken the
industry. Only 10 months ago, in February 1995, even the NRA reported
that the resources outlook was good. At some time or other in the
following summer months 7million people, including business customers,
were banned from non-essential water use; 18 million were subjected to
hosepipe bans and many suffered interrupted supplies or low flows at
times of peak demand. Now, in mid-winter, hosepipe bans continue in
areas supplied by Severn Trent, North West and Yorkshire Water. Some
Yorkshire customers may yet see standpipes used and, over large areas
of the country, only exceptional rain in the coming 3 months will avert
major supply inconveniences next summer.

Suppliers had good reason to point to exceptional circumstances in
rejecting suggestions of compensation payments. The illustration shows
a continuous decline in rainfall from March to August. Accompanied by
unusual levels of sunshine - above normal in each month to November -
and with average temperatures at or above normal, this combined to set
evaporation rates at record levels.

There have been some positive outcomes. It has brought home to all
concerned, far better than any questionnaire, that the highest customer
priority is not clean bathing beaches or Class I rivers; it is a
continuous adequate water supply. The most immediate effect has been a
new look at leakage and a revised company programme to cut losses. In
the longer term it should send a message to government to maintain a
robust approach to any new proposals from Brussels. If things go badly
this summer some revision of the Urban Waste Water Directive programme
may be needed, a matter the government  raised in Brussels in the run-
up to the 1994 Prices Review.

SPAIN STAYS CAUTIOUS ON DROUGHT DESPITE RAINS

The wettest December for at least 30 years, following the first really
wet November after four years of the century's worst drought, has
brought relief to vast areas of central-southern Spain.

But experts were in general agreement that the drought was not over by
early January and there would have to be substantial rain this spring
before celebrations could start.

In essence, most areas have their short-term domestic consumption needs
resolved, but except for the western region  of Extremadura bordering
Portugal, irrigation restrictions will continue. This in spite of the
fact that many reservoirs in the southern water authorities of the
Guadiana, Guadalquivir and Tajo (Tagus) rivers saw dramatic increases
in reserves in little more than two weeks.

Some Andalucian dams in the south that were technically dry at
Christmas held up to 30% of capacity by 3 January. The average held in
the dams in the southern water authority regions was Guadiana (27.4%),
Guadalquivir (24.6%), Sur 24.4%) and Segura (12.5%). In nearly all
cases, the figure had been below 10% at Christmas.

The 14 dams run by Madrid's Canal de Isabel II water authority saw
reserves increase by 27% to over 47% of capacity between Christmas Eve
and January 3, but this was still below the 54.4% of exactly a year
before in full drought. Canal authorities remained cautious. Madrid's
last hydrological year which ended in September, was the driest since
1912.

The western half of Spain benefited most from the rain, to such an
extent that Portugal had to ask Spain to retain the flow of the Tagus
in the Valdecanas y Gabriel and Galan dams to avoid flooding the
Portuguese city of Santarem. But in some parts of the south-east -
Almeria, Murcia, southern Valencia - the improvement has been minimal.

The exploitation directors of the Guadalquivir, Guadiana, Sur and
Segura basins in the south, where more than eight million people suffer
daily restrictions, suggested that some restrictions could be eased by
mid-January. However, this was less likely in Segura in the far south-
east, where hydrographical confederation director Manuel Miron said on
January 2. "We have disgustingly splendid weather, with a completely
blue sky and temperatures above 25xC."

In the Guadiana region bordering Portugal, confederation chairman
Antonio Alcaraz was jubilant. "For the first time in four years I am
going to enjoy watching the partial emptying of a dam in Extremadura.
We've had two anxious years to get emergency works built around the
city of Badajoz, and now we have too much water." The Guadiana dams in
the Andalucia (or far southern) area held an amazing 79% of capacity on
January 3.

The Andalucian cities of Seville, Cordoba and Cadiz were likely to see
domestic restrictions eased as local dams filled, but Malaga and most
of the rest of the Costa del Sol will probably continue to suffer
restrictions.

NEW YORK MEETS STRONG OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED WATER ASSETS SALE

Since the 1970s, New York City (NYC), America's most populated city,
has struggled to balance a steadily eroding tax base against the rising
costs of providing municipal services to its eight million residents.
The scenario is increasingly duplicated in virtually all large cities
across the country. As part of the fiscal 1996 budget the Mayor
proposed transferring title to its water and sewer system assets to the
New York Water Board (NYWB) for $2.3bn.

The NYWB currently leases the water system from the city for a 40-year
term in return for lease and rental payments. NYWB was established as a
separate entity because state law prohibits a government agency from
issuing debt and at the same time setting rates and collecting user
fees, functions the NYWB performs. Although NYWB is considered semi-
independent, its seven members are appointed by the Mayor and its staff
are city employees.

Under the budget proposal, the NYWB will borrow money to make the
purchase, repaying over 30 years with revenues from water charges. The
city's Water Financing Authority (WFA), set up to finance the building
and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems, will issue about
$2.5 billion of revenue bonds (first and second resolution). NYC will
then retire or annul its current $1.3bn of outstanding general
obligation bonds originally issued for water and sewer projects before
NYWB was created. The balance of the sale price will be used over the
next four years for critical repairs to a broad range of infrastructure
costing about $200 million annually. It would also eliminate the much-
criticised $207 million tax receivables sale programme, under which the
city paid a bank to collect taxes and received an amount equal to those
taxes a year before their due date.

Capital assets involved in the sale are 18 reservoirs in three upstate
watersheds, thousands of miles of tunnels and mains, and 14 sewage
treatment plants. The price tag of $2.3bn was determined, not on the
value of plant beyond its construction cost, some of which is very old,
but on the projected lease payments the NYWB would make over the next
30 years, assuming a 7% interest rate. Although there is a school of
thought that believes the proposed sale price doesn't reflect the true
market value of the water system, which could be determined only by
competitive bidding, a majority of the city council oppose outright
privatisation.

Proponents of the proposal argue that it means an end to NYWB's
payments to the city. Eliminating these rent payments will provide
savings to hold down water rates. Water fees would be used to pay for
the bonds over 30 years, while the rent payments would be unending. The
sale is termed "rate neutral," and ratepayers will have new security
because the NYWB, instead of paying a continuing stream of rental
payments, will owe a finite payment over a defined length of time. NYC
could use the approximate $1bn for capital and other projects, money
that would have otherwise been borrowed at higher cost.

Opponents of the proposal are equally vehement, one of whom is the
city's own Comptroller. For months he has resisted pressure from the
Mayor and council to sign the documents necessary to execute the bond
transaction. He characterised the proposal as an "illegal gimmick."
"It's illegal," he claims, "because the WFA's authority does not extend
beyond borrowing for building and maintenance. It's `"gimmicky' because
we will pay for the water system twice." Because of statements the
Mayor has made, the Comptroller also believes some of the $1bn bond
revenue will be used to pay for operating expenses not covered by tax
revenue shortfalls. It was this very practice that brought NYC to the
brink of bankruptcy in the mid 1970s.

The New York Times has lined up with the opponents saying that "... the
legal issues are complicated and subject to differing interpretations.
But we continue to believe that it would be unwise public policy for
the city to sell a vast and valuable asset to pay for construction
projects over the next four years ... and the sale poses a potential
threat to the upstate reservoirs once control of all the system passes
from NYC ..."

There is concern that the state Governor, thought to be sympathetic to
greater development of upstate regions housing the reservoirs, could
change the NYWB composition and weaken the city's control of the three
watersheds that supply its raw water (FTWB, Issue 51, p6).

Municipal bond market operators have not forgotten that the city in
1975 was plunged into a fiscal crisis when the then mayor borrowed
millions to meet operating expenses. They are watching these recent
developments closely as experts were already voicing concerns about
NYC's existing debt level. In July 1995 Standard & Poors lowered the
city's credit rating in part because of this proposed sale.

Court decisions now awaited

In November the city council sued the city Comptroller in the New York
State Supreme Court. It has requested a declaratory judgment on the
Comptroller's authority over the issuance of WFA debt. A ruling is
expected in February.

In a further development on 11 December, a coalition of eight New York
City and Westchester County civic, housing and environmental
organisations filed suit in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan to
block the sale. Spearheading these opposing groups is the Natural
Resources Defence Council, a national environmental watchdog with a
staff of 150 and 170,000 members. Their suit alleges that the proposed
sale is illegal because the scheme would, among other things, divert
approximately $1bn in water and sewer monies for unrelated purposes.

ASEAN STATES PRESS CHINA TO CO-OPERATE ON MEKONG MANAGEMENT

Leaders of the seven Association of South East Asian Nations agreed to
push for the integrated development of the Mekong basin at their summit
in Bangkok. China, Laos, Burma and Cambodia will be invited to join a
regional forum with ASEAN to channel investment into the six nations
that depend upon the Mekong for much of their water supply, transport,
energy and agricultural needs.

"We require a more co-ordinated approach, after individual governments
and institutions have worked separately for the past few years. This
will be our first attempt at regional resource co-operation," Thai
prime minister Banharn Silapa-archa told the summit.

The move follows Burma's agreement to work with other riverine nations
in developing the basin. This left only China outside the Mekong River
Commission, a loose grouping of water users that is trying to promote
sustainable development of the Mekong. Burma has promised to attend
future meetings of the Commission, though only as an observer. Planning
minister Brigadier-General David Abel said at a Bangkok seminar that
Rangoon would join Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in jointly
exploiting the river's potential. China is regarded as the prime
target, however, because the Mekong originates in Yunnan province and
one-quarter of the 4,200-kilometre river is in Chinese territory.

Financiers wary of funding further Chinese dams

"Beijing is under pressure from international (financial) institutions
to negotiate with downstream countries before they will put up any more
cash for dams. There's been too much bad feeling over their earlier
schemes," said a European banker based in Bangkok.

Water levels in the river dropped alarmingly in 1993 when China opened
Manwan dam, the first of eight reservoirs it is building on Mekong
tributaries, prompting protests from neighbouring countries.

The Commission is expected to press China for closer consultation on
water flows from the dams, especially with Laos and Vietnam. Land-
locked Laos needs ample water in the dry season to irrigate its rice
crops, and much of the country is now facing a famine because of
inadequate supplies. Vietnam depends upon high river levels to dilute
high saline levels in the Mekong delta, which is the country's main
food producer.

Initial response from the Chinese has not been too encouraging. Go Xin,
vice-manager of Yannan's Environmental Monitoring Centre, told the Thai
seminar that  "The Manwan dam will help purify the water by breaking
down pollutants and will stop erosion of the river bank. It has no
effect upon the water flow downstream."

NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS AID FUNDING FOR DAM SCHEMES

NORAD, the Norwegian state development aid agency, has broken its own
rules regarding impartial evaluation of an African hydro power project
which is a candidate for development aid funding.

The project under scrutiny is the Lower Kihansi development in
Tanzania, being undertaken by Tanesco, a local utility. A Norwegian
firm, Norplan, has conducted both the technical and the environmental
analyses of the scheme, although NORAD guidelines say the companies
undertaking those functions should be quite independent of each other.

NORAD support for Lower Kihansi was being considered, earlier this
year, in connection with the possible participation in the project of
Norway's Kvaerner group. It was temporarily blocked on the advice of
NVE, the Norwegian state Water Resources and Energy Administration, and
of the Directorate for Natural Resources Management (DN), an arm of the
Environment Ministry. Both argued that Norplan's first environmental
analysis was inadequate, and that a new study was needed to decide if
aid was appropriate

A second study - again, by Norplan - was completed during the summer.
The Norwegian environmental newsletter N & M Bulletin says that NVE has
classified as "secret" all the documents connected with this latest
study, but the newsletter "understands" that the second analysis "is
just as poor as the first. The result could be a new rejection by DN
and ... NVE."

"In its first statement DN expressed great concern about the
environmental aspects of the hydro power scheme. In the affected area
there are many unique local species which could be completely
exterminated. The high waterfall in the river system creates... a
specially damp climate, which fosters a very rich fauna and flora.
Another concern relates to the consequences of road building through
the jungle, and the impact on the local population, which will feel the
pressure from thousands of workers and others connected with the huge
development."

Chile project also questioned

Norway's Environment Ministry is critical, too, of another giant hydro
project - Chile's Bio-Bio scheme - which has secured NORAD support. In
August last year - despite strong opposition from Norwegian
environmentalists - development aid minister Kari Nordheim-Larsen
announced that NORAD would provide so-called mixed credits for Bio-Bio.

The newsletter claims to have a copy of an internal Environment
Ministry memo which is highly critical of the project, casting it as an
example of a scheme that has been granted support without adequate
justification. The Ministry believes the aid decision was dubious and
suggests `bit by bit' tactics were used to aid an apparently limited
scheme that paved the way for a larger project

The same memo is sceptical towards third world hydro power projects
generally, pointing out that they "often have significant detrimental
effects both on the environment and on the population groups affected.
Far larger population groups, economic interests and environmental
values are affected, as a rule, than is the case with developments in
our part of the world."

JORDAN SAYS RED-DEAD LINK VITAL-ISRAEL NOT SO SURE

The Dead Sea lives down to its name. The only crops that grow around it
are fed by a few streams and what's left of the Jordan River after
everyone in the region has grabbed the bulk of the water and polluted
what's left. But regularly, there are heavy downpours on the hills that
flank its Eastern shore. These turn the usually light waters of the
Wadi Mujib into a raging torrent which pour through clefts in the rock
wall into the Dead Sea with only minimal entrapment by a water-short
population in Jordan's arid highlands of Moab.

The Jordanian Government is now promoting a scheme to trap the waters
of the Mujib and another nearby basin, the Hasa, to promote irrigated
development at the lower end of the Dead Sea where the Jordanian and
Israeli authorities intend to create the Lowest Park on Earth. Zafer al-
Alem, a senior official at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, says
the Mujib and Hasa entrapment scheme, known by its local name as the
Southern Ghors, should ensure a net gain of 54m cubic metres (mcm) per
year.

The Southern Ghors Project is the smallest, but most immediate, of
Jordan's major water schemes. But in essence it only helps to postpone
hard decisions concerning water use and water availability. The
Jordanian authorities estimate that before they signed their Peace
Treaty with Israel in October 1994, their country's annual supply of
ground and surface water totalled only some 670mcm. And yet, according
to Mr. Qusei Qteishat, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Water
and Irrigation, by the year 2005 they will need 1,400mcm.

Zafer al-Alem estimates that some 215 mcm/year should come Jordan's way
as a result of the Treaty, partly by use of water stored in the Israeli-
 controlled Sea of Galilee, and partly from new dams on the Yarmuk
River that can go ahead given agreement between Israel and Jordan in
one case, and Jordan and Syria in the other. In addition, Jordan hopes
to complete a second priority project over the next seven years, the
transfer of water from the Disi aquifer in Southern Jordan, via a 310-
km pipeline; expected yield 80-100 mcm/y.

To make up the remaining 270 mcm/y it believes will be required by the
year 2005, the Ministry is planning an intensive campaign to re-use
existing water. But, as Zafer al- Alem told FTWB, "after ten years, the
problem will re-emerge. Then we will have to complete the Red-Dead
Canal."

But all these projects cost money and Jordan is not a rich country. The
relatively modest projects for the Southern Ghors are costed at
$254.2m, while the Disi pipeline, for which a feasibility study is
currently under way, is estimated at $405m. As for the Red Sea-Dead Sea
canal, this is costed at anything from $3.2bn upwards.

Detailed designs for the three dams in the Southern Ghors project at
Wala, Mujib and Tannur have already been completed, and detailed
designs for the Mujib weir and conveyer system, the largest single
element in the project, are due for completion in early 1996.

The Jordanians see the Southern Ghors as a progressive project, to be
implemented over an eight-year period. This should make it easier to
finance, since they are looking for three-quarters of the money to come
from foreign assistance, and donors generally prefer to disburse their
aid over a period of years.

Jordan also wants to improve the quality of its water. "We have
ambitious plans to clean the Jordan River, which receives a lot of
pollution," says Qteishat. "We plan to secure 10 mcm/y of desalinated
water from the springs around Tiberias (Sea of Galilee)," which he says
will be desalinated by Israel and passed on to Jordan. At present, he
says, "Israel pumps salt water out of Tiberias and passes it back to
the Jordan River. We want to make sure that no more waste water goes
into it."

Israel plans to do this by constructing what it calls a brine line from
Tiberias to the Dead Sea at a cost of $25.8 million. In addition, it
will also construct a desalination plant, possibly at Tabha, near some
brackish springs in the region, or else at Naharayim, near the border
with Jordan. Such a plant would cost around $23m and, overall, the
Israelis estimate the cost of desalination and improvement of water
quality in the Sea of Galilee as costing them a total of $98.9m over
the five years the project is expected to take. However, as well as
supplying Jordan with some 10mcm/y, a further 10-20mcm/y should be
available for Israeli consumption.

While Israel and Jordan are clearly committed in spirit, as well as in
law, to co-operating in the development of the Jordan Rift Valley, it
is clear that the level of cooperation can be expected to vary
considerably from project to project. The northern schemes are of
immediate benefit, and of generally definable and limited cost. The
practical benefits are also immediately obvious. One Jordanian
technologist involved in preparing his country's water plans, told FTWB
that Jordan expects to receive around 32 mcm/y of Israeli-sourced water
under the treaty. Almost all of this will be piped directly to Amman,
in effect providing almost one-third of the Jordanian capital's water
supply.

Given the tensions surrounding water issues in the Middle East,
Jordanian-Israeli co-operation on water management and development
since the 1994 peace treaty has been remarkable. Yet there are likely
to be some long term problems. The Jordanians are extremely keen on the
Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal which they genuinely appear to consider offers
the best prospect of meeting their additional water requirements in the
early 21st century. The project would yield an estimated 400 mcm/y
apiece to both Jordan and Israel, with desalination costs, Jordanian
officials aver, kept relatively low because the project can be powered
by the 400 metre level difference between the two seas.

However, it is equally clear that the Israelis are not so keen on the
project. One senior Israeli official told FTWB: "We consider this is a
dream. We want to see the economics clearly in place; so you can see
there is a difference of opinion" between Israel and Jordan.

To resolve such differences, the two countries have agreed to hire an
external consultant to report on the economics of the project. The
Jordanians hope the report will demonstrate the Canal's practicality
and financial viability. Since such a project would require massive
foreign aid, they are well aware that the Israelis will have to start
believing in it themselves if the scheme is to prove a success. For,
while aid donors may well be found if they see a real commitment from
both parties, scepticism from one partner is likely to produce
intensified scepticism amongst donors.

The key is whether Israel, which has more money to spend on developing
or importing alternative supplies, concludes that for political reasons
- continuing good relations with Jordan - it can gear itself up to
support the project with real enthusiasm. At present, this seems
unlikely. For Jordan, with less flexibility in terms of developing
alternative water sources, the project is considered vital if it is to
meet its most basic needs; for Israel there is no equivalent pressure.
As the Israeli official said: "We believe there is life without the Red
Sea-Dead Sea Canal."

AUCKLAND OPTS TO BOOST SUPPLIES WITH $55M PIPELINE FROM WAKATO RIVER

Auckland's Watercare Services has opted for a pipeline from the Waikato
River to meet future supply needs. In eliminating other options
Watercare is back to a plan very similar to an emergency proposal
floated at the height of a major drought in 1994. (FTWB, Issue 42, p2).

The water would be extracted from the river either by large diameter
bankside wells or infiltration galleries and pumped from the existing
Ardmore treatment station. The project will initially yield 80,000
cubic metres a day but would be designed to accommodate the possibility
of a second stage yielding 120,000 cubic metres per day around the year
2013.

The major difference over the previous emergency proposal is that this
project will have to go through normal planning permission processes.
The application to build the US$55m pipeline is likely to be filed in
March. It could take a year for all the consents to be granted,
following which there will be a 2 year construction period.  In the
meantime Watercare Services, which is a corporate entity owned by the
Auckland Regional Services Trust, is consulting local communities and
Maori tribes about the project.

Agreement of the Tainui tribe who claim ownership of the riverbed is
not a foregone conclusion. Nor is the agreement of all the local
authorities who will take the water. The Auckland district of Waitakere
City has considered going it alone with a combination of more efficient
water use and a dam project run by private enterprise.

Law changes will ease planning and funding negotiations

New legislation likely to be in place well before the process of
requesting planning permission starts will, however, make it easier for
Watercare Services to manage without the blessing of the receiving
local authorities  such as Waitakere.

Changes in the law will also provide more flexibility in selecting
funding options for this project and a major wastewater scheme. In
future, Watercare Services will be able to borrow commercially whereas
it currently has to give local authorities the right of first refusal
on whether to fund a project and it would be hard for it to proceed
without the backing of all the local authorities and loan guarantees
from them.

Watercare will in future also be authorised to reflect investment costs
in its pricing by including "the cost of its business requirements in
its prices and charges." At present it must set prices at a level which
recovers only the operating costs including interest and planned
maintenance and renewals.

Recent board changes at Watercare also mean the group is likely to be
more receptive to innovative finance proposals which involve private
operators, to the contracting out of services and buying in water from
other authorities rather than operating a closed shop monopoly.

SAO PAULO SETS LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR MAJOR WASTEWATER PROGRAMME

New water use legislation in Sao Paulo took a major step forward in
December with the approval of a master plan by the state council, a
consultative committee for the state assembly. The plan, Plano Estadual
de Recursos Hidricos, covers the period 1996 to 1999 and is based on
the user-pays principle and on the French model of administration
within river basin boundaries.The next step is for a detailed law to be
drawn up and voted on in the assembly.

Sao Paulo state has a population of 33 million and an area the size of
the United Kingdom. For the purposes of the water resources plan the
state has been divided into 22 river basin administrative areas.
Exploitation of state water resources, exclusive of treatment and
distribution, should have been charged for since 1991 according to
State Law 7.663 but this has so far been unenforced through lack of
complementary detailed legislation.

The first basin area to be created and where administration plans are
most advanced covers the Piracicaba, Capivari and Jundai rivers
situated just north of the Greater Sao Paulo connurbation. The basin
committee has already received $1.7m towards sanitation and water
supply schemes this year from a state fund, Fehidro, which comes from
royalty payments to areas flooded for hydroelectric schemes. Fehidro
should have $8.6m available for water schemes in 1996.

The Piracicaba/Capivari/Jundai Basin Committee, made up of
representatives from 57 municipalities and non-governmental
environmental organisations, has already held seven meetings and drawn
up a resources master plan for the period to 2010. Most watercourses
within the basin have, since 1977, been designated in the poor quality
classes 3 and 4 and currently serve only to dilute the polluting effect
of incoming waste waters. They are estimated to receive polluting loads
equivalent to a  biochemical oxygen demand of around 160 tonnes/day,
principally from sugar mills and other large industrial plants and a
domestic population of 2.2m.

The Plan envisages raising most of the rivers in this industrialised
area to class 2, drinking water standard, by 2010.

The Sao Paulo state government hopes to provide waste water treatment
for 80% of urban centres in the state by the year 2019. Currently only
5% of the state's waste water receives treatment.

Minas Gerais announces $825.3m, 4 year plan

Legal constraints do not appear to be affecting forward planning in
Minas Gerais where the state water company Copasa, Companhia de
Saneamento de Minas Gerais, has announced an ambitious $825.3m plan for
the period 1996-1999.

The principal element of Copasa's plan is the Prosam project involving
waste water treatment in state capital Belo Horizonte and the
depollution of the city's two main water courses, the Arruda and Onca.
This involves building a comprehensive main drainage system and two
large waste water treatment stations. Amongst other things the plan
envisages provision of 356,000 new water supply connections and 154,000
drain connections. The company hopes to cut drinking water supply
losses, currently the lowest in Brazil at 27%, down to 25%.

PWA CHIEF FACES SECOND INQUIRY OVER CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION

In a second indictment by the government within two months the head of
Thailand's Provincial Waterworks Authority (PWA) is to be investigated
over alleged mismanagement of a major contract.

In this instance the charge concerns late completion of a drinking
water contract. The PWA head, Visit Lorthirapong is said to have failed
to enforce punitive measures against the contractor involved in
installation of the Nong Khae district pumping station in central
Saraburi province. The work was completed 200 days late, incurring a
penalty of $720,000, but no fine was ever collected.

"If found guilty of abusing his authority by the auditor's office, the
PWA governor will face dismissal," said a spokesman for Deputy Interior
Minister Suchart Tancharoen, who ordered the investigation.

This is the second charge against Visit  since the current government
came to power in early July. He already faces investigation for
apparently defying an order by Suchart to delay the signing of a $160-
million contract for the Putham Thani water treatment plant. That
contract went to Thames Water International of the UK and Karnchang, a
Thai construction firm. According to industry reports, Suchart had
favoured a rival syndicate in the bidding. A review of the contract by
the Interior Ministry is nearing completion. Visit has told the inquiry
panel that he signed the contract because it had already been approved
by the former government of Chuan Leekpai.

Two unsuccessful bidders, led by Italian-Thai Development, Thailand's
largest construction group, and industrial estate operator MDX, lodged
official protests against the decision. Italian-Thai is known to have
close ties to Suchart's Chart Thai party, which forms the core of the
governing coalition.

Visit has been suspended since the row broke, and is not expected to
resume his post, even if he is cleared by the two investigations.

MALAYSIA PLANS $1BN SPEND ON WATER SUPPLY 1996 -2000

Malaysia's deputy Works Minister said recently that around $1bn will be
allocated to water infrastructure expansion in the country's 1996-2000
national plan.

Minister Datuk Railey Jeffrey said more than the RM2.4bn ($0.94bn) in
the 1991-1995 plan will be needed to satisfy a predicted 73% increase
in demand to 11.4bn litres/day by 2000.

REPORT PROVIDES GOOD REFERENCE TO UK WATER COMPANY PERFORMANCE

Business Ratio Plus :Water Companies*   is probably the best collection
of publicly available information on water industry results collated
into one reference book.

The 1995 8th Edition covers the industry in England and Wales. For each
of the 10 regional water service plcs and the 20 or more water supply
companies it provides a range of good hard fact - contact details,
directors' names, turnover by subsidiaries, three full years' balance
sheets and profit and loss details. The core businesses of the 10 plcs
are treated to the same examination.

A reference work of this sort is  out-of-date as soon as it rolls off
the presses, as is the information it includes but, until an on-line
version is produced it's the best we can reasonably expect.

The latest figures relate to the year ending March '95 and the sector
has had interims, various bids and a long hot summer to cope with since
then. Further developments up to the end of the third quarter of 1995
are covered briefly in the Industry Comment section at the back of the
book. The performance analyses and league table positions are detailed
and avoid the need to work them out. The ratios, the meanings of which
are defined, are grouped into six categories; profitability, liquidity,
gearing, efficiency, employee performance and exports/sales. League
positions of the individual companies are ranked in the same way. Thus
at #1.17bn Thames Water plc had the highest turnover as at 31.3.95 and
produced the largest profit, #303.7m. Severn Trent employs 200 more
people than Thames and has the greatest total assets of #3.69bn.

Apart from Wessex Water which has a pre-tax profit margin of 51.1% none
of the Big 10 finds its way into the top five most profitable
companies. Indeed eight of them are below the water supply only
companies average gross margin of 31.6%. Does this prove that small is
beautiful when it comes to water companies? Investors may find this
analysis useful and industry players can keep an eye on what the others
are doing; it all depends on where your interest lies.

Business Ratio Plus :Water Companies  does not go into the unregulated
businesses in any greater detail than to list their turnover. In the
long run this may be where the real differences and investor interest
arise. For that we will need annual reports, latest interims and a lot
more specific company research but as far as it goes this is an
excellent basic handbook to the water industry in England and Wales.

SOUTHERN AND BRISTOL WATER COMPLETE INTERIMS REPORTING SEASON IN UK

Southern Water plc, the last of the big 10 to report at the interim
stage, is showing turnover up to #206.9 million from #190.6 million
last year.

The massive retained profit of #58.7 million, or 28.37% of turnover,
continues a trend. The comparable figure was #86.9 million or 22.59% of
sales for the full year to 31 March and #52.5 million or 27.5% at the
half way stage in 1994. It is not surprising then that Southern intends
to buy back its shares although it might have been more imaginative and
expanded the business rather than shrinking it.

In fact it intends to fund the exercise by increasing the dividend by
year end so that the total cost to the company will be the same as
buying its own shares. Even so by then funds in the share premium
account and reserves look set to exceed #1bn

In addition to "returning value to shareholders" Southern also intends
to defer the permitted 1% price increase for 1996/7 and bring in a
"customer benefit programme" costing #50 million. This will go towards
"discretionary" spending on "distribution, foul water flooding and
odour control."

If Southern can achieve all this in such a drought year, with only a
hose-pipe ban by way of emergency measures, is it charging too much for
its services or investing too little in the infrastructure? Southern
may end up being praised for its prudence but like other suppliers the
1996 outlook may depend on the extent of winter rains.

Bristol Water Holdings plc increased turnover to #33.16 million from
#31.31 million this time last year. Operating profits were up to #8.25
million from #6.54 million in 1994 when they took into account a #1.1
million re-reorganisation provision. This has now fed through to the
bottom line of #4.78 million and retained profit of #3.75 million.

Hopefully this will help ease net borrowings which still run at 68% of
total shareholders' funds. At the full year they had been 91% and at
the interim stage last year 87%.

Meanwhile shareholders' funds have crept up from #43.5 million to #47.7
million since 31st March 1995 year end suggesting a move from debt to
equity financing although without full view of the underlying numbers
this cannot be verified.

Bristol still has large capital projects to fund, particularly the
Gloucester to Sharpness Canal which it estimates will cost #2 million
by the end of the century.

Following restructuring and reduction of the workforce by 15% perhaps
Bristol is set fair for improved results at the full year.

TENDERS ISSUED FOR $38M FORTALEZA TREATMENT PLANT

Brazil's state development bank, BNDES (Banco Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Economico e Social) is expected to provide 75% of the
finance for a project to double treatment plant capacity at the Gaviao
reservoir which serves the city of Fortaleza in Ceara state, north east
Brazil.

An announcement to this end was made by the bank's director of
privatisation, Elena Landau on 4 December and tenders for the $37.8m
build, operate, transfer (BOT) project were issued two days later.

Private companies will be paid from water bills from a quarter of
Ceara's connections over a period of 15 years.

EIB LENDS ECU100M VIA POLISH BANKS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SCHEMES

A credit line of ECU100m advanced by the European Investment Bank to
four foreign banks operating in Poland -  ABN-AMRO, Creditanstalt, ING
Bank, and Raiffeisen-Centrobank - is intended broadly for use on
`infrastructure' projects.

An EIB spokesman told FTWB the intended coverage could range from
installing telephone lines to building tourist facilities, but
environmental projects, including water/wastewater treatment schemes
would certainly qualify. Individual loans could range from ECU20,000 to
ECU 25m. depending on the intermediary bank chosen.

The loans would be relatively cheap, with interest charged at 150 basis
points (1.5%) over Libor (London interbank offered rate), and repayment
over up to 11 years.

The EIB raises market funds as cheaply as anybody, given its AAA rating
as a supranational institution. Furthermore, by lending through foreign
banks, the EIB has been able to obtain guarantees from the foreign
banks' parents in Amsterdam or Vienna, thereby avoiding the
complications of extracting a government guarantee from the Polish
authorities, as would have been needed in the case of a Polish bank. By
lending through one single intermediary, the EIB has kept to a minimum
the number of margins that must be added to the basic cost of the
money.

AMORIM BUYS MAJOR SHARE IN LUSAGUA

The Amorim group, Portugal's biggest cork products group and one of the
country's largest business conglomerates, has acquired 50% of Lusagua,
a water company, previously wholly owned by two Spanish groups, Aguas
de Barcelona and Canal Isabel.

The acquisition, made by increasing Lusagua's capital from Es100m
($150,000) to Es200m, represents an important diversification for the
Amorim group. The two Spanish companies retain the remaining 50%. The
acquisition was made shortly after Lusagua, in association with another
company, Aquagest, was awarded a concession to manage the water supply
and waste water treatment systems of Carvoeiro, the name given to a
group of municipalities centred on Aveiro in northern Portugal.

MINISTERS PLAN INCREASED SPENDING ON WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS

A total of $60 million has been allocated for provincial waste water
treatment plants in Thailand this year (1996), double the 1995
expenditure. Included in an $84-million environmental fund, the money
will be allocated under 1992 legislation that requires provincial
governments to formulate local action plans.

"The funding has been raised substantially because of the heavy
response from provincial administrations. There are at least five
municipalities that will begin waste water treatment plants (in 1996),"
said Saksit Tridej, a senior official in the Environment Ministry.

While the funding comes from the national government, local authorities
must conduct feasibility studies and provide land for the plants. The
system reverses a previous trend of centralised planning from Bangkok.

"It's a very effective method, as the government can allocate budgets
to local agencies to tackle pressing environmental problems," said
Saksit. "They are in a better position to know what is needed that we
are."

Resource studies planned in East and West provinces

Elsewhere the Industry Ministry has called for feasibility studies on
improvement of supplies to factories in the eastern and western
provinces following complaints from manufacturers.

Industry minister Chaiwat Sinsuwong said East Water, a partially
privatised water distributor, would be commissioned to overcome
shortages affecting much of the eastern seaboard, including supplies to
state-run industrial estates.

"The supplies need to be improved but also the pricing. Everyone is
complaining that piped water is too expensive in these two areas," he
said. "What may be needed is better resource management."

Efforts to boost supplies have been thwarted by a shortage of suitable
sites for reservoirs; the government is considering importing water
from Cambodia if new domestic sources cannot be found.

FRENCH GROUPS COMBINE IN BID FOR CONTROL OF MID-KENT WATER

Generale des Eaux's British subsidiary General Utilities, and its
Bouygues Group counterpart Saur Water Services have announced that they
intend to launch a takeover bid for the UK`s Mid Kent Water.

The French have indicated an offer of #4.40 a share, valuing Mid Kent
at some #80m ($126m). But the bid will have to await the approval of
the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This is not likely to be a
stumbling block, given the recent approval of the much more significant
bid by Lyonnaise des Eaux for the regional water and sewage utility,
Northumbrian Water. One difficulty might arise however from the advice
of the Mid-Kent board that shareholders should reject the bid.

The two French-owned companies already hold 39% of Mid Kent, but would
like control.  General Utilities already owns Folkestone and Dover
Water which serves the area adjacent to Mid-Kent on the east side,
while Saur Water Services controls South East Water to  the west of Mid-
Kent.

Generale and Saur say a takeover would optimise water usage in the area
and thereby reduce the risk of water shortages.

South East Water is the largest of the three companies with 618,000
clients and an annual turnover of #50.9m. Mid Kent serves  525,000
users and Folkestone and Dover, annual turnover #10.4m, serves
151,000.

In all, General Utilities provides water for 3.1m persons in the UK via
four companies, while Saur Water Services provides for 1.3m persons via
two companies.

UWR TO PARTNER JERSEY CITY FOR WATER SYSTEM OPERATION

United Water Resources (UWR), America's second largest investor-owned
water services company, on 11 December won the contract to manage the
water system of Jersey city, an industrial community across the Hudson
River from the tip of Manhattan Island. Population to be served is
about 240,000.

The contract is subject to public hearings and approval of the New
Jersey state public utility. UWR anticipates a successful outcome of
the approval process and is scheduling a start this Spring. It will be
the largest public-private partnership for a municipal water operation
in the country.

The company says the proposal will bring major economic benefits to
Jersey City over five years through operating efficiencies, improved
billing, job creation, plus the purchase of Jersey City's excess water
supplies.

UWR is a holding company whose subsidiaries engage in water-related
businesses, real estate, and environmental testing. It provides water
and wastewater services to about two million people in 13 states.

WORLD BANK TO FUND $13.5M STUDY FOR REGION'S LARGEST DAM

The World Bank has agreed to fund the second stage of a feasibility
study for the Son La hydro-electric dam in Vietnam, which will be the
largest to be constructed in Southeast Asia.

Bradley Babson, spokesman for the Bank's mission in Hanoi, said the
involvement was conditional upon Vietnam using a recognised level of
design and construction and protecting ethnic minorities who live in
the area. "We are not financing the dam, but we may provide funds to
make sure that they do the studies for the dam in a way that will fit
international standards," he said. Expected to take two years, the
$13.5m study will look at the environmental impact and social
repercussions from the relocation of thousands of local residents.

An earlier study by Sweden's Sweco consultancy found that the project
was economically viable, and recommended two sites on the Black River,
a tributary of the Red River in northern Hanoi.

Expected to have an electricity output of up to 3,794 megawatts, the
project will be twice the size of Hoa Binh dam, 190 kilometres
downstream, which is currently the largest in the region.

Meanwhile, construction of a $110-million hydro-power plant has started
at Song Hinh in central Phu Yen province. Work on a series of dams with
a power output of 370 million kilowatt hours began in 1991.

USCG STRIKES A COMPROMISE IN FINAL OSRO GUIDELINES

In a compromise between the conflicting concerns of the nation's
two largest oil spill removal organizations (OSROs), the
U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has issued final guidelines on a revamped
OSRO classification process that will require response
organizations to maintain "redundant" quantities of any
contracted or "nondedicated" response resources that they wish to
count toward their classifications. In the weeks preceding the
release of the final guidelines, the National Response Corp.
(NRC) and the Marine Spill Response Corp. (MSRC) expressed very
different views regarding the way that the revamped
classification system should count nondedicated resources (OPB,
15 Dec. 1995, p.1). MSRC, whose response network consists
primarily of owned or "dedicated" response resources, argued that
nondedicated resources should not be counted toward an OSRO's
classification unless the OSRO can demonstrate the ability to
deploy those resources in a timely manner. In contrast, NRC,
which makes extensive use of nondedicated equipment and
personnel, contended that, for classification purposes, dedicated
and nondedicated resources should be considered equivalent.

Under the final guidelines, an OSRO may count nondedicated
resources as part of its response capability, but it must arrange
for access to at least twice as much nondedicated equipment and
personnel as it needs to meet the guidelines' response resource
standards. "If an OSRO elects to use nondedicated resources,
there must be a redundancy factor of 2 to 1," USCG wrote in the
final guidelines. "This means that the OSRO must ensure the
availability of nondedicated response resources by contract or
other approved means in quantities equal to twice what the OSRO"
would be required to maintain if those same resources were
dedicated, according to USCG. "Ideally, dedicated resources
provide more of a timely response 'guarantee' than nondedicated
resources," Admiral James Card explained in a cover letter
accompanying the final guidelines. However, "historically, the
response industry has depended to varying degrees on nondedicated
resources to perform some critical response functions," according
to Admiral Card. "To better ensure the availability of these
nondedicated resources, we have required a redundancy factor of
2 to 1 when using nondedicated response resources," Admiral Card
wrote.

USCG's decision to require a 2 to 1 redundancy factor for
nondedicated resources appears to be acceptable to NRC, but not
to MSRC. "Everyone was waiting to see how USCG would handle the
issue of dedicated and nondedicated resources," NRC President
Mark Miller told OPB. "I think they have reached a compromise
that addresses the concerns of all of the parties involved,"
Miller said. "With the tremendous inventory of dedicated and
nondedicated resources that NRC has available, I fully expect
that the program we developed several years ago will stand up
under the new classification system," Miller said. MSRC Corporate
Relations Director Greg Rixon told OPB that, although "redundant
contracts may increase the likelihood that nondedicated resources
will be available in the event of a spill, MSRC still believes
that the only way to positively ensure response capability is to
maintain dedicated resources." In addition, MSRC contends that a
redundancy factor of 2 to 1 does not provide sufficient assurance
of equipment availability, according to Rixon. "In our opinion,
USCG would be close to achieving a reasonable assurance of
availability with a redundancy factor of 3 to 1, and would
probably reach full assurance with a factor of 4 to 1," Rixon
said.

OSRO classification background: USCG classifies OSROs to help
vessel and facility owners select organizations that are capable
of meeting their response planning requirements under the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). Section 4202 of OPA 90 requires
vessel and facility owners to develop response plans that
"identify and ensure, by contract or other means, the
availability of private personnel and equipment necessary to
remove, to the maximum extent practicable, a worst-case
discharge." The OSRO classification process is voluntary;
response organizations are not required to apply for OSRO
classification. Although vessel and facility owners do not have
to contract with classified OSROs to meet the OPA 90 planning
requirements, plan holders who rely on classified OSROs are
exempted from the requirement to document in their plans all of
the response resources that they intend to contract in the event
of a spill.

The newly released final OSRO classification guidelines replace
those contained in Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular
(NVIC) No. 12-92, which USCG issued in December 1992 (OPB,
18 Dec. 1992., p.2). "After the implementation of NVIC No. 12-92,
weaknesses were identified in the classification process that
prevented the program from realistically representing the
response capabilities of an OSRO," Admiral Card explained in the
cover letter for the final guidelines. USCG held public workshops
in January 1994 and June 1995 to solicit comments on the OSRO
classification process and, during September 1995, issued draft
guidelines on a revamped system (OPB, 22 Sept. 1995, p.1).
According to Admiral Card, USCG received written comments on the
draft guidelines from about 70 organizations during the public
comment period, which ended on 30 November 1995. "As a result of
the comments received, and our own review, the draft guidelines
have undergone many changes," Card noted. He claimed that the
final guidelines will allow USCG to "accurately and consistently
calculate an OSRO's capability to respond to specific plan holder
requirements."

"We continue to stress that using a USCG-classified OSRO does not
in any way relieve plan holders of the responsibility to ensure
that their specific response needs are met," Card wrote in his
cover letter. "The revised classification guidelines provide a
good indication of an OSRO's response capability by COTP zone,"
Card noted. The OSRO classifications "do not, however, represent
a 'one size fits all' solution," Card wrote. "USCG created the
voluntary OSRO classification program so that facility and vessel
response plan holders could list USCG-evaluated OSROs in lieu of
providing voluminous detailed lists of response resources,"
according to Admiral Card. "This was, and still is, the only
regulatory benefit that plan holders receive from utilizing USCG-
classified OSROs," Admiral Card explained.

Final OSRO classification process: Although USCG has included new
requirements for nondedicated resources and other changes in the
final guidelines, the final classification process is very
similar to that outlined in the draft guidelines proposed during
September 1995. Like the draft guidelines, the final guidelines
specify that USCG will enter information about each OSRO's
response resources into a database--the Response Resource
Inventory--and then use a computer program to classify the
organization. The program will assign each response organization
"geographic-specific" classifications--that is, separate
classifications for each Captain of the Port (COTP) zone in which
the organization operates. According to USCG, the computer
program will automatically take into account an OSRO's ability to
transport or "cascade" its resources in response to spills
outside of the COTP zones in which the equipment is stored.

For each COTP zone, USCG will assign a response organization one
of five OSRO classifications ranging from A (least capacity) to
E (most capacity) in any or all of the following operating
environments: rivers and canals, inland regions, the Great Lakes,
and oceans. The five classifications will reflect both an
organization's ability to deploy equipment within certain time
frames and its effective daily recovery capacity (EDRC)--a
function of the amount of boom, oil recovery equipment, and
temporary storage that the OSRO can access during a spill
response. For example, to receive a class C rating in the inland
operating environment of a particular COTP zone, an OSRO would
have to have an EDRC of 10,000 barrels per day. In addition, that
OSRO would have to be capable of mounting a spill response in
that COTP zone within the following time frames: 6 hours for a
spill from a facility in a high-volume port; 12 hours for a
facility spill in a non-high-volume port; 12 hours for a spill
from a vessel in a high-volume port; and 24 hours for a vessel
spill in a non-high-volume port.

Like the draft OSRO classification process, the final OSRO
classification process takes into account not only an
organization's total response resources, but also its ability to
deploy various types of response equipment together as a
"system." According to both the draft and the final guidelines,
an organization's EDRC will be determined by the least-capable
component of its oil recovery system. For example, if an OSRO has
a temporary storage capacity of 30,000 barrels per day, but has
skimming or vacuum equipment that is capable of recovering only
10,000 barrels per day, the OSRO's EDRC will be limited to
10,000 barrels per day. During the classification process, USCG
may consider any of the following additional factors: the
availability of trained personnel to operate the organization's
equipment; the suitability of the OSRO's equipment for the
environments in which it operates; the organization's ability to
provide logistical support for a spill response; and the OSRO's
ability to use response techniques other than mechanical recovery
methods.

Changes from the draft process: Based on the comments received on
the draft guidelines, USCG made several revisions to the final
OSRO classification process. The final guidelines give each OSRO
the option to apply for classifications in a particular COTP zone
based on its resources in a city in the zone other than the city
in which the COTP office is located. In contrast, the draft
guidelines would have counted only the resources in the COTP
city. In the draft guidelines, USCG specifically stated that the
temporary storage capacity used to calculate an OSRO's EDRC would
"not include fixed, shore-based storage capacity." However, in
the final guidelines, USCG revised this policy. "An OSRO that
operates in an area where fixed storage is a realistic asset may
claim fixed storage as meeting part of its temporary storage
requirement," according to USCG. When determining whether to
count fixed storage, "the key factor that USCG will evaluate is
whether the temporary storage that an OSRO has identified will
allow the OSRO to sustain its classified EDRC throughout spill
response operations," the agency noted.

Under the draft guidelines, USCG would have evaluated an OSRO's
ability to dispose of recovered oil as part of the classification
process, but this criterion has been omitted from the final
guidelines. In addition, in the draft guidelines, USCG did not
address whether OSROs could receive credit for response resources
designated to meet state resident-equipment requirements.
However, in the final guidelines, USCG noted that "OSROs that
have designated equipment to meet state resident-equipment
requirements must indicate this on their OSRO application."
According to USCG, "for classification purposes, designated
resident equipment is not cascadable outside of the area for
which it is designated." As under the draft guidelines, OSROs
classified under the final guidelines will be reevaluated every
three years to verify that their classifications are accurate.
The final guidelines also specify that USCG will conduct "random
spot checks" between each regularly scheduled reinspection visit
"to confirm resource availability and equipment operability."

Reaction from NRC and MSRC: In separate interviews with OPB about
the final OSRO classification process, NRC and MSRC both
commented on the importance of dedicated resources to the
nation's overall spill response capability. To illustrate MSRC's
perspective, Rixon compared USCG's response planning regulations
to a high-jump competition. "Congress and USCG initially set the
bar at a certain height," according to Rixon. "USCG then
discovered that only one company--MSRC--could clear the bar,"
Rixon claimed. "Rather than say to everyone else, you must train
harder to compete in this event, USCG decided to lower the bar,"
according to Rixon. "We are not the only organization with
dedicated resources, but we did acquire a higher percentage of
dedicated resources than any other organization, and we did that
at great cost to our clients," Rixon explained. "When NRC and
other companies wanted to get into the game, they decided not to
spend the kind of money that we spent," according to Rixon. "In
fact, these companies realized that they could gain a competitive
edge by not acquiring as many dedicated resources," Rixon said.

By failing to fully recognize the limitations of nondedicated
resources in the OSRO classification system, USCG "has placed the
whole concept of dedicated resources in grave jeopardy," Rixon
claimed. "The end of dedicated resources will not come like a
thunderclap," according to Rixon. "Tomorrow, we will not wake up
and find that all of this country's dedicated response resources
are gone, but they will erode slowly, and eventually no OSROs
will have them," Rixon said. "Then, at some time in the future,
USCG will try to execute the response plans that are in place,
and they will discover that the dedicated assets that they were
relying on are not there any more," Rixon said. "We believe that
USCG must take steps to ensure that dedicated assets remain in
place or that nondedicated resources are maintained in sufficient
numbers so that there is some degree of certainty that enough
equipment and personnel will be available when a major spill
occurs," Rixon said. In addition, "USCG must improve its efforts
to test and evaluate the capability of OSROs on a true no-notice
basis, especially those OSROs that rely on nondedicated
resources," according to Rixon.

According to NRC's Miller, "there is no proof that dedicated
equipment is more reliable than nondedicated equipment during a
spill response." Miller pointed out that "NRC has responded
successfully to 85 oil spills," whereas "MSRC does not have that
kind of track record." Therefore, MSRC "can only guess that their
dedicated resources might be better in a spill response," Miller
said. He noted that, "at a time when most of MSRC's customers are
doing away with their owned and dedicated tanker fleets and
regularly chartering ships on the spot market, it seems curious
to me that MSRC does not recognize the hypocrisy of advocating
dedicated resources for spill response." According to Miller,
"MSRC went out and spent a lot of money on dedicated equipment,
and as a result, they have saddled their customers with a
tremendous expense and an ungainly organization." In contrast,
"NRC looked at the marketplace, purchased equipment as needed,
saw that nondedicated resources were available, and developed a
better program for our customers," Miller said. For a copy of the

NOAA ADOPTS RESTORATION-BASED NRDA PROCESS IN FINAL RULE

On 5 January, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) issued its long-awaited final rule
specifying the methods that federal, state, and tribal trustees
are authorized to use when conducting natural resource damage
assessments (NRDAs) under OPA 90. The NRDA process described in
the final rule is essentially the same as the "restoration-based"
approach outlined in NOAA's "reproposed" NRDA rule, which the
agency issued during August 1995 (OPB, 11 Aug. 1995, p.1). Under
the final rule, which will take effect on 5 February, the NRDA
process will focus on determining the appropriate scale of the
restoration projects required to "make the environment and the
public whole" following a spill. The trustees for the natural
resources injured by an oil spill will evaluate the injuries
caused by the spill and develop a detailed plan for returning the
injured resources to their baseline condition and compensating
the public for the lost use of those resources while they are
being restored. The responsible parties (RPs) will then either
fund or implement the restoration plan.

The restoration-based NRDA approach contained in the final rule
and in NOAA's August 1995 proposal differs significantly from the
process that the agency outlined in its first proposed NRDA rule
during January 1994 (OPB, 15 Jan. 1994, p.1). Under that original
proposed rule, the NRDA process would have focused on assessing
the monetary value of the natural resources injured by an oil
spill. The RPs would then have been required to pay the
calculated sum to the trustees, who would have used it to restore
or replace the injured natural resources. The January 1994
proposal was sharply criticized by representatives of the marine
insurance and oil transportation industries, who argued that the
methods it proposed for calculating natural resource values were
arbitrary and therefore might lead to grossly inflated damage
claims under OPA 90. The critics of the January 1994 proposed
rule were particularly concerned about its inclusion of the
controversial contingent-valuation method, which involves the use
of surveys to determine the "passive use" values of natural
resources. Passive use values are the values that people attach
to resources that they do not use but that they nevertheless
regard as important to preserve.

Like NOAA's August 1995 proposal, the final NRDA rule defines a
more limited role for contingent valuation and other valuation
methods than the role outlined in NOAA's January 1994 proposal.
The final rule limits the use of valuation techniques to specific
circumstances and states that these techniques may be used only
to determine the appropriate scale of natural resource
restoration projects. The use of contingent valuation and other
valuation methods for this purpose "avoids many problems
identified by commenters regarding the use of continent valuation
to calculate a dollar value" for natural resource damages, as
specified in the January 1994 proposed rule, NOAA stated in the
final rule. According to NOAA, under the final rule, RPs are
liable for the cost of implementing restoration actions that
generate value equivalent to the lost value of the injured
natural resources, not for reimbursing the trustees for the
calculated lost value of the resources.

NOAA's decision to limit the role of valuation methods in the
August 1995 proposed rule alarmed environmental groups, who
claimed that, by switching from the original valuation-based
approach to a restoration-based approach, the proposal would fail
to fully compensate the public for the inherent value of natural
resources. These groups argued that, by giving RPs the option to
undertake restoration projects instead of paying economic damages
following a spill, the proposal would ultimately lead to lower
recoveries for the public. Insurance companies and shipping
organizations also criticized the August 1995 proposed rule.
These groups claimed that, although the proposal focused the NRDA
process on determining the scale of restoration actions, it
provided only general guidance on NRDAs and would therefore give
trustees the option to use a wider variety of assessment methods.

In the preamble to the final rule, NOAA defended the restoration-
based NRDA approach. According to NOAA, by requiring trustees to
assess natural resource injuries for the purpose of determining
the required scale of restoration activities, the final NRDA
process will "validate trustee determinations regarding those
actions that will make the environment and public whole." In
addition, NOAA noted that, while the final rule "provides for the
use of a range of appropriate and cost-effective assessment
procedures," the rule also includes a set of standards that any
assessment procedure must meet. For example, the rule specifies
that assessment procedures must be "capable of providing
information of use in determining the type and scale of
restoration appropriate for a particular injury" and must be
"reliable and valid for the particular incident." NOAA also said
that, because the final rule gives RPs and the public
opportunities to participate in the restoration planning process,
"restoration will be achieved more quickly, transaction costs
will decrease, and litigation will be avoided."

NRDA rulemaking history: The publication of the final NRDA rule
came more than five years after NOAA first issued an advance
notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register to solicit
comments on approaches for conducting NRDAs under OPA 90 (OPB,
18 Jan. 1991, p.1). Since that time, NOAA has published eleven
Federal Register notices related to the NRDA process, including
its first proposed NRDA rule during January 1994, the August 1995
reproposed rule, and the final NRDA rule. In addition, NOAA has
held numerous public workshops and regional meetings during the
past five years to solicit input on the various methods that have
been developed to assess natural resource damages. According to
NOAA, the final rule draws on the comments received and provides
"a NRDA process intended to meet OPA 90's goal of expeditious,
cost-effective, and feasible restoration of natural resources and
services injured by incidents involving oil."

Although the final rule was published in the Federal Register on
5 January, NOAA submitted the rule to the Federal Register office
on 28 December 1995, thereby meeting the deadline specified in a
consent decree that the agency reached last year with the Natural
Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The consent decree resolved a
suit filed during 1994 by NRDC and eight other environmental
groups against NOAA for failing to promulgate a final NRDA rule
by 18 August 1992, as required under OPA 90 (OPB, 4 Nov. 1994,
p.2). Under the consent decree, NOAA agreed to file its
reproposed NRDA rule with the Federal Register by 31 July 1995,
and to file the final rule on approaches for conducting NRDAs by
31 December 1995. The agency met both deadlines.

Final NRDA rule: Like the August 1995 proposed rule, the final
rule divides the NRDA process following an oil spill into three
phases: preassessment, restoration planning, and restoration
implementation. In the first phase--preassessment--the trustees
must determine whether the spill warrants a complete NRDA. Based
on the information available, the trustees must determine whether
the incident may have resulted in any injuries or any risk of
injuries to natural resources under their trusteeship and
therefore whether the incident qualifies for a natural resource
damage claim under OPA 90. In addition, the trustees must
evaluate whether the emergency spill response operations will
eliminate the threat of ongoing injuries to natural resources.
"If injuries are expected to continue, and feasible restoration
alternatives exist to address such injuries, the trustees may
proceed with the assessment," NOAA explained in the rule.

The second phase of the NRDA process--restoration planning--has
two components: injury assessment and restoration selection.
According to NOAA, "the goal of the injury assessment is to
determine the nature and extent of the injuries to natural
resources and services, thus providing a technical basis for
evaluating the need for, type of, and scale of restoration
actions." Under the final rule, natural resource injuries are
defined as any "observable or measurable change in a natural
resource" or any "impairment of a natural resource service." As
part of the injury assessment, the trustees must determine first
that natural resources have been exposed to the spilled oil, and
second that this exposure has caused an injury. By comparing the
condition of the injured resources to their baseline condition,
the trustees must quantify the degree and spatial extent of the
injuries and estimate their temporal extent.

After the injury assessment is completed, the trustees begin the
restoration selection process, which involves the identification,
evaluation, and selection of various restoration alternatives.
Under the final rule, the trustees must identify a "reasonable
range" of restoration alternatives, including both "primary
restoration actions," which are designed to help restore the
injured natural resources to their baseline condition, and
"compensatory restoration actions," which are intended to
compensate the public for the lost use of natural resources
during the restoration period. The final rule specifically states
that trustees must consider "natural recovery" as a primary
restoration option. In addition, the trustees may consider
actions intended to prevent interference with natural recovery or
more intensive actions that they believe would return injured
resources to their baseline condition more rapidly or with
greater certainty than natural recovery. When identifying
possible compensatory restoration actions, trustees are required
first to consider those actions that provide services of the same
type and quality as those lost as a result of the spill. If the
trustees cannot identify a reasonable range of this type of
compensatory actions, they may consider other compensatory
actions, provided that these actions make available services of
comparable type and quality to those lost.

To ensure that the restoration actions identified by the trustees
appropriately address the injuries arising from the incident, the
trustees must "scale" the actions. The final rule specifies two
approaches for determining the appropriate scale of a restoration
action: the "resource-to-resource" or "service-to-service"
approach, and the "valuation" approach. In the resource-to-
resource or service-to-service approach, the trustees determine
the quantity of resources or services that have been lost and
identify actions that provide at least an equal quantity of
replacement resources or services of the same type and quality as
those lost. In the valuation approach, the trustees use valuation
methods, such as contingent valuation, to calculate the value of
the resources or services lost as a result of the spill and to
determine the value expected to be gained from the various
restoration actions under consideration. The trustees then scale
the restoration actions so that they provide resources or
services of equal value to those lost. The final rule states that
trustees may use the valuation approach only if they are
considering actions that provide resources or services of a
different type and quality from those lost, or if the resource-
to-resource or service-to-service approach is inappropriate.

Once the trustees have identified a reasonable range of
restoration alternatives, they must select the "preferred"
alternatives. When selecting the preferred alternatives, the
trustees are required under the rule to consider the following
factors: 1) the cost of each alternative; 2) the extent to which
each alternative is expected to return the injured natural
resources and services to their baseline condition or to
compensate the public for the loss of resources and services
during the interim period; 3) the likelihood that each
alternative will be successful; 4) the extent to which each
alternative will prevent further natural resource injuries from
the spill and avoid collateral injuries during implementation;
5) the extent to which each alternative benefits more than one
natural resource or service; and 6) the effect of each
alternative on public health and safety. Under the final rule,
the trustees must select the most cost-effective of two or more
equally preferable alternatives. The trustees then develop a
draft restoration plan presenting the preferred alternatives and
make the draft plan available for public review and comment.
After reviewing the comments, the trustees develop a final
restoration plan.

In the third phase of the NRDA process--restoration
implementation--the trustees present the final plan to the RPs,
who must either implement the plan themselves or provide the
funding for the trustees to implement it. According to NOAA, the
restoration implementation phase provides an opportunity in the
NRDA process for the settlement of natural resource damage claims
without litigation, because the trustees and the RPs can
negotiate the best way to proceed with the restoration plan. If
the RPs refuse to fund or implement the final restoration plan,
the trustees are authorized under OPA 90 to file a civil suit
against the RPs in federal court to recover the cost of
implementing the plan. If the response costs and natural resource
damages arising from a spill exceed the RP's liability limit
under OPA 90, or if no RP has been identified, the trustees may
seek funding for the restoration from the Oil Spill Liability
Trust Fund.

Under OPA 90, NRDAs performed by federal, state, or tribal
trustees in accordance with the procedures contained in the final
rule "have the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption on
behalf of the trustees in any judicial or administrative
proceedings." In the final rule, NOAA interpreted this
presumption to mean that "the RP has the burden of presenting
alternative evidence on damages and of persuading the fact finder
that the damages presented by the trustees are not an appropriate
measure" of the natural resource injuries caused by a spill. If,
in any portion of an assessment, the trustees use procedures that
are determined not to be in accordance with the final rule, the
trustees will not receive the rebuttable presumption for that
portion of the assessment. In addition, NRDAs performed by
foreign trustees in accordance with the final rule are not
entitled to the rebuttable presumption.

NOAA's response to comments on earlier NRDA proposals: In the
final rule, NOAA noted that it "has made every effort to
consider" all of the comments that it received on the NRDA
proposals issued in January 1994 and August 1995, as well as the
comments submitted at the agency's public workshops and meetings
on NRDA issues. Of the 71 Federal Register pages in the final
rule, 37 pages are devoted to addressing comments. "Many
commenters supported the shift in focus from monetization of
damages to scaling of restoration actions" under the August 1995
proposal, NOAA said. "These commenters stated that the reproposed
rule properly placed the focus of the NRDA process on the
ultimate goal of OPA 90--to restore injured natural resources and
services," the agency said. However, according to NOAA, "many
other commenters raised concerns that the restoration approach
would lead to delays and increased assessment costs, since
trustees would have to undertake studies of both lost services
and replacement services." In addition, "several commenters
argued that the August 1995 proposal was significantly weaker
than the January 1994 proposal, with no justification except
industry pressure for an untested restoration-based approach
instead of the well-tested and supported economic valuation
procedures," according to NOAA. Other commenters characterized
the restoration-based NRDA approach as "an untried theory" that
"might be better or worse" than the valuation-based approach
originally proposed, NOAA said.

In defense of the restoration-based NRDA process, NOAA noted
that, under OPA 90, "all damages recovered must be spent on some
restoration activity." Therefore, the NRDA process should focus
on evaluating potential restoration actions, NOAA said. "It does
not benefit the natural resources or the public if monies are
collected without a view toward how they will be spent, nor
whether sufficient funds have been collected to implement any
meaningful restoration actions," according to NOAA. The agency
claimed that, "contrary to some comments, the restoration
approach will generally speed restoration and avoid litigation,
by alleviating distrust that claims for monetary damages are
speculative and punitive." According to NOAA, "practical
experience in implementing the restoration scaling approach in
past cooperative assessments suggests that this approach is
effective in significantly expediting the restoration of injured
natural resources and services." The agency added that "these
benefits to the environment and public do not come at the expense
of increased assessment costs." Although, under the final rule,
"trustees now must assess replacement services in addition to
lost services in most incidents," NOAA claimed that, "in general,
a net increase in assessment costs will not result, due to both
the cooperative provisions set forth within this rule and the
removal of the requirement that trustees estimate the monetary
value of damages."

According to NOAA, "the sole intent of the rule is to ensure the
restoration of natural resources and services that have been
injured, destroyed, or lost as a result of an incident." Such
restoration should occur "where there is a need to do so, and
where feasible and cost-effective means to accomplish restoration
are available," the agency said. The rule's focus on restoration
will "eliminate unneeded assessment studies and prevent
unnecessary adversarial conflicts over misunderstood goals of
trustees," according to NOAA. The agency claimed that the rule
"invites RPs to act cooperatively and responsibly to seek
expeditious and cost-effective restoration" and that it
constrains trustees' actions "to those necessary to achieve OPA's
restoration goals." As a result, according to NOAA, "costs and
damages will not be excessive or unpredictable." For further

UNDERWATER PIPELINE RUPTURE CAUSES MAJOR SPILL IN RUSSIA'S
SOUTHERN URAL MOUNTAINS.

A large but undetermined amount of crude oil spilled from an
underwater pipeline into the Belaya River near the town of Ufa in
Russia's Ural mountains on 26 December, when the line ruptured as
a result of corrosion, according to Russia's Emergencies
Ministry. Uralsibnefteprovod, the regional oil transport company
that operates the pipeline, shut down the 28-inch-diameter line
after detecting a drop in its operating pressure. The company
initially estimated that 100 metric tons of crude oil had leaked
from the ruptured pipeline, but recent reports from Russia's
ITAR-TASS news agency indicate that the spillage may have been
much higher. The spilled oil from the pipeline has flowed
downstream beneath the frozen surface of the Belaya River and,
according to some reports, has reached as far as the Tatarstan
region, which is about 100 miles from Ufa. According to a
spokesman for Russia's Emergencies Ministry, response crews have
set fire to the oil in open areas of the river to prevent it from
spreading. In addition, the crews have deployed boom to contain
the oil and have used skimming equipment to recover the oil
contained within the boomed areas. As of 7 January, the crews had
recovered 664 metric tons of an oil-water mixture from the river,
including up to 100 metric tons of crude oil. Severe cold and
adverse weather conditions have reportedly hampered the cleanup
efforts. Although the Belaya River provides drinking water for
Ufa, the Emergencies Ministry spokesman noted that the spill will
probably not impact Ufa's water supplies, because the pipeline
rupture occurred downstream from the town's water intakes on the
river. In a separate incident during 1989, a total of 765 people
were killed as a result of a massive explosion in a natural gas
liquids pipeline near Ufa (OPB, 17 July 1991, p.8). The incident
occurred when vapor leaking from the pipeline was ignited by two
trains passing through the vapor cloud.

SOLAS AMENDMENTS MANDATE ENHANCED INSPECTION PROGRAM FOR AGING
TANKERS AND BULKERS.

Aging oil tankers and bulk carriers will be subjected to more
rigorous surveys under major amendments to the International
Maritime Organization's (IMO's) 1974 International Convention for
the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). The amendments, which took
effect on 1 January, were adopted during May 1994 by a special
diplomatic conference of the parties to SOLAS (OPB, 3 June 1994,
p.1). At the conference, delegates adopted the amendments as part
of three new chapters to SOLAS--Chapters IX, X, and XI.
Chapter XI contains the new vessel survey requirements.
Chapter X, which contains a code of safety requirements for high-
speed vessels, also took effect on 1 January. Chapter IX, which
makes mandatory IMO's International Safety Management Code, will
enter into force on 1 January 1998. "The enhanced program of
inspections was developed by IMO as a result of increasing
concern about the aging of the world merchant shipping fleet,"
according to IMO spokesman Roger Kohn. "This is particularly true
of tankers and bulk carriers, the majority of which are now
between 15 and 20 years of age," Kohn said. He noted that the
enhanced inspections "pay special attention to corrosion." During
the inspections, "coatings and tank-corrosion prevention systems
must be thoroughly checked, and measurements must be carried out
to check the thickness of plates," according to Kohn. In addition
to mandating new survey requirements, Chapter XI contains three
other regulations intended to improve ship safety. One regulation
requires that all cargo vessels of 300 GT or more and most
passenger ships obtain a valid IMO ship identification number.
Another regulation requires classification societies that perform
vessel surveys on behalf of flag-state administrations to follow
guidelines adopted during 1993 by the IMO Assembly. The third
regulation gives port-state control officers the authority to
evaluate the operators of a foreign-flag ship "when there are
clear grounds for believing that the master or crew are not
familiar with essential shipboard procedures relating to the
safety of ships." The port-state officers may detain that vessel
if their evaluation shows that the crew has inadequate knowledge
of the vessel's operations.

ENVIRONMENT CANADA REPORT EXAMINES BEHAVIOR OF OIL IN COARSE
SEDIMENTS.

Although oil penetrates to greater depths on beaches with coarse
sediments than it does on beaches with fine sediments, oil is
less likely to form lasting deposits in coarse sediments than it
is in fine sediments, according to a draft report by Environment
Canada's Emergencies Science Division. The report, entitled
Stranded Oil in Coarse Sediment Experiments, presents the
preliminary results of research sponsored by Environment Canada
to examine the relationship between sediment particle size and
the penetration and retention of oil in beach sediments.
According to the report, "in all test series, oil penetrated to
greater depths in coarser sediments." In addition, the report
noted that, for most types of oil, retention "generally decreased
in coarser sediments." However, the report also said that the
relationship between oil retention and sediment particle sizes
"differed markedly for the various crude oils tested." In the
experiments, Alaskan North Slope crude oil exhibited "one of the
most unusual sediment retention relationships, with moderate
retention in finer sediments and very low retention in coarse
sediments," the report said. It noted that the oil retention of
Alaskan North Slope crude oil in the experiments was consistent
with the behavior of that type of oil after it spilled from the
Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound, Alaska, during 1989.
According to the report, "of all the oils tested, Alaskan North
Slope crude oil would be the most likely to freely percolate
through coarse surface sediments and to be retained in high
concentrations in the underlying fine sediments," the report
said. In fact, following the Exxon Valdez spill, "most of the
cleanup effort that occurred during 1990, 1991, and 1992 was
directed towards the cleaning of subsurface oil on coarse
sediment beaches with fine underlying sediments, even though this
coastal type represented a relatively small proportion of the
total coastline oiled," the report said. For a copy of the draft

WORLD SPILL BRIEFS.

An undetermined amount of crude oil spilled from a pipeline
outside the city of Araquita in northeastern Colombia on
8 January, after rebel troops sabotaged the pipeline with
explosives, according to a spokesman for Ecopetrol, the state-
owned company that operates the line. Although Ecopetrol shut
down the pipeline after the attack, the company has been unable
to begin repairing the damaged segment due to continuing
skirmishes between Colombian government soldiers and rebel forces
from the National Liberation Army. According to the Ecopetrol
spokesman, the National Liberation Army, which has carried out
numerous acts of sabotage in recent years against the company's
oil pipelines, claimed responsibility for the recent pipeline
attack.

A 32-inch-diameter pipeline ruptured due to corrosion and spilled
an undetermined amount of crude oil on 24 December about 60 miles
west of Ukhta in the Russia's northern Komi Republic, according
to Russia's ITAR-TASS news agency. Crews from Transneft, the
state-owned company that operates the pipeline, have reportedly
replaced a 165-foot-long section of the damaged line. Although
news reports initially indicated that the spilled oil from the
pipeline had contaminated the Ropcha River, Transneft officials
have since said that the oil did not enter the river. Transneft
has also estimated that it will take at least three weeks to
clean up the spill. One of the largest pipeline spills in world
history occurred during the fall of 1994 near Usinsk in the Komi
Republic, about 200 miles northeast of the recent pipeline
rupture (OPB, 4 Nov. 1994, p.1). In April 1995, a natural gas
pipeline exploded in a wooded area about 8 miles outside of
Ukhta, sending flames hundreds of feet into the air and burning
several acres of forest (OPB, 5 May 1995, p.6).

The 97,689-DWT Bahamian tanker Alandia Wave spilled an estimated
500 to 1,000 gallons of crude oil on 21 December while loading
oil at the British Petroleum terminal on the Sullom Voe in
Shetland, U.K., according to a spokesman for the Shetland Islands
Council. The oil apparently leaked from a crack in the tanker's
No. 1 port cargo tank, but surveyors have not yet determined what
caused the crack. After determining the source of the spill, the
Alandia Wave's crew was able to minimize the spillage by
transferring oil from the No. 1 tank to other tanks aboard the
vessel. Although response crews from the Shetland Islands Council
and British Petroleum deployed boom to contain the spill, a small
amount of the spilled oil came ashore on a beach at Sella Ness.

The government of Singapore recently ordered Singapore Refining
Co. to pay a fine of $150,000 Singapore ($1.00 Singapore =
$0.70 U.S.) in connection with an oil spill that occurred on
25 August 1995 from a pipeline at the company's refinery in Palau
Merlimau, off Singapore's southwestern coast, according to news
reports (OPB, 8 Sept. 1995, p.7). About 300 metric tons of heavy
fuel oil leaked from the pipeline through a valve that was
accidentally left open during an oil transfer operation. The
spilled oil formed a 60-square-kilometer slick and came ashore at
beaches on the tourist resort island of Sentosa, about
12 kilometers east of the refinery. An estimated $1.7 million
Singapore was spent to clean up the spill.

OIL POLLUTION BULLETIN HOTLINE.

NRC and Edison Chouest Offshore Inc. of Galliano, Louisiana, have
reached an agreement in principle to integrate Chouest's staff
and fleet of offshore vessels into NRC's network of oil spill
response resources. According to NRC, Chouest currently employs a
staff of about 600 people and operates a fleet of 57 vessels in
the Gulf of Mexico, as well as on the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific
coasts. With the addition of the Chouest fleet, NRC's Marine
Resource Network now consists of more than 800 crew boats, supply
vessels, utility vessels, barges, and tugboats throughout the
United States. "We are pleased to be working with Chouest, which
is represented by a highly professional group of employees,"
commented NRC President Mark Miller. "NRC believes that the key
to rapid response to an oil spill is access to people,
specialized equipment, and marine resources," Miller said. For
further information, contact: Mark Miller, NRC, 460 Edwards
Avenue, P.O. Box 609, Calverton, NY 11933; Tel: 516-369-8644;

In the first application of its "direct final rule" process, USCG
recently issued a final rule to remove the text of the
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea
(COLREGS) from the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
According to USCG, the COLREGS text, which is found in 33 CFR
Part 81, duplicates text also found in the United States Code and
is therefore unnecessary. Under the direct final rule process,
USCG may issue a final rule without first publishing it as a
proposed rule, provided that the agency does not expect to
receive any adverse comments on the final rule. If USCG receives
no adverse comments on the final rule within a specified time
period, the rule takes effect. If adverse comments are received
during that period, USCG must publish a notice in the Federal
Register retracting or modifying the rule. The recent final rule
removing the COLREGS text from the CFR will take effect on
1 April, unless adverse comments are received. For further
information, see pages 8 and 9 of Vol. 61, No. 1 of the Federal

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT's) Research and
Special Programs Administration (RSPA) plans to hold a public
workshop on 18 January in Washington, D.C., to solicit comments
on the agency's recently proposed criteria for identifying
"unusually sensitive" environmental areas in close proximity to
gas and hazardous liquid pipelines (OPB, 16 June 1995, p.8).
According to RSPA, many federal, state, and local regulations,
including RSPA's current rules on pipelines that carry oil and
other hazardous liquids, refer to "environmentally sensitive"
areas without clearly defining what constitutes such areas.
Persons who are unable to attend the workshop may submit written
comments; these comments are due by 5 February. For further
information, see pages 342 to 344 of Vol. 61, No. 3 of the
Federal Register, or contact: Christina Sames, RSPA, DOT,
400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20590-0001; Tel: 202-
366-4561.

On 28 December, USCG issued a supplemental notice of proposed
rulemaking (SNPRM) on structural measures designed to reduce the
amount of oil spilled from non-double-hull tankers until their
mandatory retirement from service in U.S. waters under USCG's
double-hull regulations (OPB, 29 Dec. 1995, p.5). Although OPB
had expected to provide full coverage of the SNPRM in this issue,
the release of USCG's final guidelines on the OSRO classification
process and NOAA's final NRDA rule has delayed OPB's coverage of
the SNPRM until next issue.
