CRICKET VICTORY IS OPENING BOUNCER AS CABLE DECLARES WAR ON MURDOCH

UK cable operators led by the US regional telephone companies are
willing to invest large sums in cable-only programming to mount a major
challenge to British Sky Broadcasting's dominance of new-media
channels.  They say that their surprise #7.5 million purchase of all UK
rights to the 1996 Cricket World Cup will be the first of many
programme ventures in the near future.

The operators will bid for further sports rights, films and events and
look to launch new niche channels, including local and ethnic services.
 They will commission original British programming to compete against
``the more American'' Rupert Murdoch, 50-per-cent owner of BSkyB.  This
is likely to involve co-operative deals with independent television
companies and possibly investments in, as well as commissions for,
independent production companies.

The cable operators and telephone companies plan to launch an Asian
channel later this year, produced by Yorkshire Television.  A sports
channel is also likely to be launched, a spin-off from Wire TV, the
lifestyle and sports channel owned by the group which bought the
cricket rights.

The telephone companies, like the biggest of the cable operators,
TeleCommunications Inc, are rich enough to fund the drive towards more
and better programming.  As one telephone-company executive put it,
``the #7.5 million for cricket rights is small change if you look at
the millions we're putting into building cable.''

But what about the less rich, middle-sized cable companies?  Can
they afford programming investment?  According to the same executive,
``they recognise, as much as we do, that there is a ``need to create
cable-controlled production so Murdoch cannot go on telling us what to
do.''

Only the cable operators were prepared to offer the money being asked
for the World Cricket Cup rights asked by rights owner WorldTel.  There
was no bidding.

BSkyB, the BBC and Channel Four were interested -- but unwilling to talk
the same language (see separate story).

The cable operators argue that, although BSkyB's channels are the
programming powerhouse in UK new media, the situation must not be
allowed to continue ad infinitum.  They respect the pioneering work
done by Murdoch in developing satellite programming, but they are
determined that he should not be allowed to control the destiny of
cable because of his dominance in programming.

The cable operators have always regarded cable-only programming as
important, but the only operator with the cash and will to get into
programming in a major way has been TeleCommunications Inc.  TCI, which
transmits some of its channels on the Astra direct-to-home satellite,
spent many months persuading the operators to get together to form
Cable Programme Partners 1 to launch Wire TV last May.

CPP1, comprising three telephone companies (US West, Nynex and
Southwestern Bell) and two US cable operators (Comcast and TCI), has
gradually become a forum for strategic thinking on cable programming,
``no longer worrying about what's going to be on Wire at 7.30pm,'' as
one member put it (though by no means all the group is happy with the
channel).  The purchase of the Cricket World Cup rights has accelerated
this movement, galvanising the operators to consider: What next?

The CCP 1 operators will be joined by two others -- General Cable, which
has several franchises in Yorkshire, and Jones Cable, which runs the
Leeds franchise -- to launch a new Asian channel, Hum.  The operators,
which will form a new partnership (CPP 2), will provide some upfront
funding for production and start-up, but talks are continuing with
Yorkshire TV, which will produce the channel, over whether it will also
take a stake and over what kind of access it will have to advertising
time.

The operators do not believe that the existing channels, TV Asia,
AsiaNet (formerly Asiavision) and Namaste Asia Television, are good
enough and that a much better service could be provided.  Yorkshire
suggested a range of possible schedules to the operators, with varying
quantities of original, UK-produced and bought-in programmes.  Hum
(Hindi for ``all of us'' or ``mine'') would show films, factual
programmes, soaps, children's programmes and music.

The channel is a good example of local or ethnic programming which
cable is well-suited to provide.  Narrowcasting and regionalism will be
important weapons in cable's battle against BSkyB, according to Robin
Williamson, executive director of US West.  As part of this, the
operators will have to build links with the UK independent production
community, which at the moment relies on ITV and Channel Four for most
of its business.

However, the new economics of the ITV sector are changing.  Independent
companies are having to find new markets for their product as the ITV
market consolidates, and Williamson suggests that cable operators may
invest directly in the companies and their facilities.  Direct co-
operation with the production arms of the ITV companies themselves is
also a possibility.

Senior ITV executives such as Ted Childs, head of drama at Central
Television, and Jonathan Powell, heads of drama at Carlton, point out
that the trend in ITV is towards a separation of production from the
business of running a channel.  Stand-alone production subsidiaries
have been created at all the ITV companies, and these subsidiaries are
being encouraged to mould themselves as separate profit centres.

This pushes them towards taking in partners, such as international
partners, BSkyB or the cable companies.  Programmes, Childs and Powell
say, could be produced by the production ``arms'' and never get shown
on the ITV network.

One of the toughest areas facing the cable operators is the provision
of feature films, given BSkyB's virtual monopoly of pay-television
rights to Hollywood films for the foreseeable future.

That has left the pay-per-view rights to go for, with the operators
leaving the job to the London Interconnect group of operators, which
wants to launch a film ppv service this spring over the system linking
their networks.  Most of the operators own systems across the country,
so a national roll-out would start, hopefully, towards the end of the
year, using digital compression on a satellite transponder provided by
TCI.

The Interconnect group consists of TeleWest (comprising TCI and US
West, both members of CCP1), Nynex and Comcast (also members of CCP1),
General Cable (CPP2), Videotron and Encom (run by Bell Canada).

Hollywood has stymied a spring launch, the operators' second attempt to
get a film service going.  According to one Interconnect executive, the
film studios are uncertain of the merits of pay-per-view, given its
disappointing performance in the USA.

The London operators say that talks are ``ongoing'' and they still hope
to reach agreement.  Some cable executives believe, however, that the
studios have not seriously put the ppv rights ``in play''.  According
to Williamson, US West, the largest single shareholder in Time Warner,
will be given the opportunity to join any bidding for Warner Bros ppv
rights.

Williamson believes that the UK could ``probably sustain a number of
movie channels''.  The top films will be hard to get.  But there are
alternatives.  Film distribution company, Odyssey Film Distributors,
for instance, is planning its own cable-exclusive channel, drawing on a
library of mini-series, US made-for-television product and B movies.
CPP could also conceivably strike deals with other independent
distributors.

ONLY CABLE ACCEPTS SOARING VALUE OF CRICKET CUP

The cable operators' #7.5 million acquisition of rights to the 1996
Cricket World Cup took the terrestrial broadcasters and British Sky
Broadcasting by surprise.  The cable operators were for the first time
bidding for major sports rights -- and were prepared to go far higher
than the rest of the players.

The players -- the cable operators' Cable Programme Partners 1, British
Sky Broadcasting, Channel Four and the BBC -- did not formally bid.
Instead, WorldTel, which owned the rights, told them that it valued the
rights at #7.5 million.  Only the cable operators said they were
willing to pay that price.

BSkyB had paid #1 million for the 1992 cup.  Four years earlier the BBC
had paid #150,000.  So did the operators pay too much?  That will not
be clear for some time, though they did buy more rights than BSkyB and
BBC had bought for the earlier competitions.

The operators are taking all UK rights, including those for all forms
of live and delayed terrestrial, microwave, DTH and cable transmission
and for all video, radio and advertising.  They could sell many of
these on to terrestrial broadcasters, particularly those for delayed
television transmission and radio.

Mark Mascarenhas, president of WorldTel, says that his valuation was in
line with the growing cost of sports events worldwide.  A one-day
cricket international, he argues, has 71 minutes of advertising slots
within it and should be priced accordingly.

BSkyB was surprised by the valuation, even though it has been as
responsible as anybody for lifting the price of rights in recent years,
accepting that they had been undervalued.  The low values were to a
large extent the result of the main customer being the BBC, which does
not carry advertising.

ITV then started competing more fiercely and BSkyB came on to the
scene, with Murdoch showing ``genius'' in understanding the need for a
higher valuation and winning several high-profile events.  At the same
time, sports governing bodies grew more adept at valuing their own
product and television revenues became more important to the sports
themselves.

No one is suggesting that Murdoch is taking a more cautious line.
Recently, he paid #1 billion for the rights to North American football
games for his Fox television network, taking them away from CBS.

MEDIA BODIES COULD FORCE KIRCH TO CUT PRO 7 STAKE

A group of German state media authorities is threatening to force the
Kirch family to sell part of its stake in film-based television channel
Pro 7, on the grounds that the holding may be in breach of German rules
on the concentration of ownership in the new-media sector.

Fourteen out of the 15 authorities have told Pro 7 -- which is 47.5-per-
cent owned by Thomas Kirch, son of media magnate Leo Kirch -- that it
must provide details of its finances to prove that it is independent.
They say that the information must be supplied by the end of this
month.  Pro 7 has so far refused to comply.

The group of authorities -- which includes all except the media
authority of Schleswig-Holstein, the authority which actually granted
Pro 7 its licence to broadcast -- dispute the channel's claim that the
Thomas Kirch shareholding is entirely independent of Leo Kirch's
control.  They argue that it should be treated as part of the Leo Kirch
empire which includes stakes in the general-entertainment channel Sat
1, the pay-television channel Premiere and the sports channel DSF.

They say that the Kirch holding in Pro 7 should thus be no more than 25
per cent -- the maximum level that would be allowed if the stake were
held by Leo Kirch directly.

The group of authorities say that if the channel refuses to co-operate
they will put pressure on Schleswig-Holstein to strip the channel of
its licence.  Schleswig-Holstein has up to now supported the channel,
but could find it difficult to maintain this position if it is opposed
by everybody else.

The 14 authorities have told Pro 7 to submit financial information on
three specific points which they believe will resolve the question of
Pro 7's independence.  But Pro 7 says that it will not supply the
information on the grounds that it is ``commercially sensitive.''

First, the authorities want Pro 7 to supply details of the financial
circumstances surrounding Thomas Kirch's original 1988 investment in
the channel's predecessor, Eureka TV.  The authorities say that there
is no indication as to where Thomas Kirch could have raised the money
other than from his father.

Second, the authorities require information about the arrangements that
the channel made with its banks to cover its debt in the years
following its relaunch as Pro 7 in January 1989.  They suspect that Pro
7's bank loans were guaranteed by Leo Kirch.

Third, the authorities want details of the film-supply deals which Pro
7 has with companies owned by Leo Kirch.  The authorities believe that
Pro 7 has been given preferential terms which involve it being allowed
to delay payment for films, and also to pay for films on an individual
basis.

They say that if the required information is not supplied by the
beginning of April, they will seek to persuade Schleswig-Holstein to
rescind Pro 7's licence immediately.

If Pro 7 does comply with the request, but the information does not
demonstrate that the channel is independent, the authorities will
demand that Thomas Kirch should reduce his share in the channel below
25 per cent within one year -- with the threat of licence removal if he
does not comply.

George Kofler, chief executive of Pro 7 and a minority shareholder,
says that the channel will not comply with the authorities' requests,
which he claims are part of a political campaign against the channel,
resulting from the Kirch family's affiliation with the right-wing CSU
party.

Kofler says that he has shown all the cited documents to the media
authority of Schleswig-Holstein and that circulating the documents to
the other 14 authorities could lead to leakage of sensitive commercial
information on issues such as programme-supply contracts.

He says that the director of the Schleswig-Holstein media authority,
Gernot Schumann, was satisfied with the information, and so the o0her
authorities should allow Pro 7 to continue without further
interference.  He does not believe that Schumann will order any action
against Pro 7.

Kofler argues that Thomas Kirch's original acquisition of a stake in
the channel did not cost that much because it was made at a time when
Eureka TV was effectively a ``bankrupt station.''  He adds that the
channel's backers have not had to put in any more money since then
because investment has been financed by bank loans and by ploughing
back into the company any surplus from advertising, which has grown
steadily as Pro 7 has grown into the third most popular private channel
in Germany after RTL-tv and Sat 1.

A total of DM150 million was invested for the relaunch, since when
advertising revenues have climbed steadily, growing from DM11 million
in 1989 to DM45 million in 1990, DM165 million in 1991 and DM400
million in 1992.  The channel is thought to have taken DM600 million in
1993 and is projected to take DM650 million in 1994.

Kofler adds that Pro 7's banking arrangements have satisfied Schleswig-
Holstein's financial experts -- despite the suspicions of the other
authorities about the involvement of Leo Kirch.

On the specific question of programme acquisition, he says that Pro 7
buys its material on the same terms as every other channel.

The media authorities deny that their action has a political nature.
They say that Pro 7 must convince them all of its independence -- not
just Schleswig-Holstein.  They say that the burden of proof rests with
Pro 7, and that if the channel cannot prove its independence, then it
will be treated on the same basis as it would be if it were 47.5-per-
cent-owned by Leo Kirch himself.

Schumann argues that this is the wrong approach.  He believes that the
burden of proof on disputed questions of media ownership rests with the
media authorities.  Since they cannot prove Pro 7's connection with Leo
Kirch, he says, they should leave the channel alone.

Leo Kirch's shareholdings in German television comprise: 43 per cent in
the full-service general-entertainment channel, Sat 1; 25 per cent in
the thematic pay channel Premiere; and 24.5 per cent in the thematic
sports channel DSF.

Other cases: The media authorities have been considering several cases
where there have been worries about concentration of ownership, but
have decided to take no further action beyond that which is in process
already.

RTL2, which has in the past been a source of concern to the authorities
on the grounds that the coupling of CLT and Bertelsmann amongst the
shareholders matched the position in RTL-tv, is no longer seen as a
problem because the authorities accept that the two companies are not
working in concert in either case.

Other ownership questions, such as that of Bertelsmann's share of Vox
(Satellite TV Finance 4:13), are already being addressed separately.

CHANNELS WANT CHANGES TO OWNERSHIP RULES

Private television companies in Germany are calling for changes in the
law on the ownership of cable and satellite channels to ease the
introduction of new channels based on digital compression.  They say
that the number of new channels will be greatly reduced unless the
regulations are changed.

The programme-providers want changes to the rules limiting the number
of themed channels they are allowed to own.  They say that the present
rules, which impose severe limits, will result in too many new channels
being owned by smaller or new-to-television companies, which are less
likely to have the expertise to operate successful themed channels.

The existing rules, they say, will also encourage foreign companies to
beam channels into Germany, for instance from the UK or Luxembourg, to
take advantage of unfulfilled opportunities.  Digital compression is
likely to be introduced in two to three years.

Dr Peter Luke, head of the legal department at Sat 1, which is keen on
the changes, said that the company does not have specific plans for
themed channels but wants the law changed for the good of the German
television industry.

The Verband Privater Rundfunk Telekommunikation, which represents the
private channels, is also worried about the existing rules on political
balance in themed channels.  It accepts that ``full-service'' channels
should have to provide balanced coverage of news and current affairs,
but that it should be unnecessary for themed channels: there will be
many, perhaps hundreds of themed channels and political balance will be
achieved across the whole range, taken together.

The programme providers say that themed channels should be exempted
from some of the regulations because they will be so numerous and get
such small audiences -- even now the channels attract less than a two-
per-cent viewing share each compared with more than 10 per cent for the
most popular ``full-service'' channels, and because they cover single
issues, such as particular sports or types of music or hobbies, where
it could be unreasonable to expect strict impartiality.

The media authorities are sceptical about changing the regulations.
Lothar Jene, deputy director of the Hamburg media authority, said that
relaxing or removing the regulations could lead to channels defining
themselves as themed channels but still broadcasting general-
entertainment programming.  He thought that the media authorities would
be unlikely to deregulate the channels.  Joachim Becker, deputy
director of the Hessen media authority, also thought that a change in
the law was unlikely.

Ingebord Ludwig, a legal adviser at the Berlin-Brandenburg authority,
was more encouraging.  She said that the likely proliferation of
channels could lead to a relaxation because it would not be sensible to
restrict very small channels.

The present law lays down that a company may own more than 25 per cent
of only one full-service channel (that is, one which shows a range of
programming) and up to 25 per cent of as many as it likes.  It can also
own more than 25 per cent of one themed channel and, again, up to 25
per cent of as many as it likes.

A company which does not own a full-service channel can own more than
25 per cent of two themed channels and up to 25 per cent of as many
others as it likes.  Themed news channels are restricted as if they
were full-service channels.

MTV MAY BE ONLY MEMBER OF SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGE

MTV Europe, the satellite pop-music channel, may be the only member of
an encrypted subscription package to Astra dish homes launched in
Germany this autumn.  Other UK channels which have been hoping to join
the Selco marketing package, set up by the Kirch family's Pro 7 and
Rupert Murdoch's News Datacom, are unlikely to have sorted out rights
problems in time to join the package at launch.

Selco believes that MTV, encrypted in News Datacom's Videocrypt system,
will attract between 200,000 and 300,000 subscribers over two years --
compared with the present Astra dish market in Germany of 4.5 million.
So MTV would lose the bulk of its German dish market -- and possibly
some advertising revenue -- for the sake of a relatively small amount of
subscription revenue.

The move, part of a German-wide and European-wide switch to encryption
for the channel, is an ambitious one, given its present German market,
and flies in the face of the accepted wisdom for pay-channels to stick
together in numbers.  MTV refused to comment.  However, German
television executives believe that MTV's strength in the German market
gives the channel a better chance than most of making a stand-alone
subscription offer work.

Astra dish owners in Germany will initially have to pay a monthly
subscription of between DM5 and DM10 to receive MTV -- on top of buying
a videocrypt decoder costing between DM200 (#79) and DM300.  When other
channels join Selco, MTV could be sold as part of the package, which is
what Selco would prefer, or as a stand-alone service attached to the
main package.

The channel has already reached an agreement with Deutsche Telekom in
which it will receive a fee for distribution to the company's near-14
million cable subscribers -- in return for the channel continuing to be
distributed in the clear.  MTV will continue to pay Deutsche Telekom
about DM1 million a year for the downlinking of the channel signal, but
will now end up slightly in the black.  The channel is seeking a
similar deal with the private cable operators.

In the UK, the channel is set to encrypt and join the Sky Multi-
Channels package this autumn.  It is also talking to Filmnet about
inclusion in its MultiChoice Kaleidoscope mini-pay package sold in
Benelux and Scandinavia and due to be extended to Hungary, the Czech
Republic and Portugal.  Further talks are taking place with cable
operators in several European countries.

Selco was due to launch a package of four to six encrypted English-
language Astra channels to DTH homes in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland this April, but put back the launch because of their
difficulty in clearing German-market rights.  It will provide
subscription-management services such as billing, smartcard
distribution, and customer support.

MTV will retain control over the subscription fee, at least while it is
the only channel in the package.  It is unlikely to have little left
after paying Selco's costs, but the terms of the deal are still being
negotiated.

The channel is calling for what amounts to a larger fee-per-subscriber
from Germany's private cable systems than it got from Deutsche Telekom:
30 pfennigs a month against a likely 0.7 pfennigs.  It has told the
private operators association Anga that, if it is unable to reach
agreement with the association and individual operators seek a deal
after encryption, the charge will double.  An Anga source said that,
despite MTV's huge popularity in Germany, some operators may be
prepared to make do with Viva, the rival music channel launched in
December.

CAN CANAL PLUS AFFORD TO KEEP OUT OF PPV?

The approaching launch of a pay-per-view service on Paris cable
networks has raised the question of whether Canal Plus will seek to
retain its dominance in French pay-television by launching its own pay-
per-view service.

The channel says that it will not, that the market and the technology
is not ready for it.  It will, instead, wait for digital compression
and launch a near-video-on-demand service in two or three years time.
But observers question whether (1) the company can afford to let a
rival service develop and (2) whether political factors, once again at
the centre of French media, will dictate a change in policy.

The cable ppv service, founded by Lyonnaise Communications and France
Telecom, was always seen as a commercial rival to Canal Plus and as an
attempt to pre-empt Canal Plus from introducing its own ppv service.
Now that Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion and TF1 have jumped
on board, the service looks to be an even stronger threat to Canal
Plus.

CLT has made no secret of its wish to break Canal Plus' monopoly of pay-
television.  But what if, as some observers suggest, in the wake of the
shareholding and personnel changes at Canal Plus, CLT were to become
more closely allied with the pay-television operator?  Would the two
groups want to come together?  If not, would it make commercial sense
for Canal Plus to carry on waiting for the market to mature?

Even within the present media environment, without any further major
changes, Canal Plus and its shareholders will face a dilemma when,
later this year, the Paris ppv service begins to be rolled out across
the country.  Compagnie Generale des Eaux, thought now to be a very
powerful force within Canal Plus, will have to decide whether to take
the ppv service on its cable networks, the most extensive in the
country.

Several analysts believe that it will not; that, whatever technical or
programming reasons CGE gives, it will not be prepared, as a major
Canal Plus shareholder, to take a service from a rival group of
companies.  But it may have difficulty simply watching from the
sidelines.  As one senior CGE executive put it, ``although politically
the company might not wish to get into bed with [the Paris group], it
has to run its systems profitably.  It will obviously be under pressure
to take it.''  The service, he said, would be taken if it were likely
to be popular.

Some analysts believe that CGE and Canal Plus, which is being forced by
the government to get more involved in cable, could launch its own
joint service.  If the rival service were popular, Canal Plus and CGE
would find it difficult to wait.

For the moment, Canal Plus argues that the French market is not well-
enough developed for ppv to be successful.  The cable service will not
be profitable, it says, because the US studios are unlikely to be
interested until there are one million subscribers -- French cable as a
whole has only 870,000 broadband subscribers -- and the cable group has
enough power to negotiate good film rights.

It says that US experience suggests that a wide choice of programmes
needs to be offered at frequent intervals.  So, it says, it is much
better to wait two or three years until digital compression creates the
capacity to provide a near-video-on-demand service.  Viewers need to be
offered a choice of films -- between four and 10 -- with the possibility
of choosing any of the films every 15 to 30 minutes.

STAR RETHINKS PAY-TV AFTER WHARF BREAKDOWN

Star TV, the pan-Asian satellite broadcaster controlled by Rupert
Murdoch, is to suspend its four premium pay-television services,
following this week's breakdown of negotiations with Wharf Cable in
Hong Kong over carriage terms.

Star says that it is to re-examine the channels -- all of which were
devised initially for relay on Wharf, but were also intended for
subsequent broadcast across Asia via satellite -- and that it could
amend some of them or abandon them altogether.  But it adds that it
still wants to launch pay channels in some form.

The Star move has come as a shock to the Asian News and Business
Channel, the pay channel specially commissioned by Star from NBC, FTTV
and Reuters TV.  The partners in ANBC, which had been hoping to use
Wharf as a base from which to launch the service in other Asian
markets, will meet in the next two weeks to discuss whether the channel
should continue, and if so how.

The other three pay services -- two film channels and a children's
channel -- were all produced by Star itself.

This week's breakdown of discussions between Wharf and Star followed a
long-running dispute between the two, part of which concerned Wharf's
carriage of the four pay channels.  Star has been sending these to
Wharf by landline since the launch of the latter's cable service last
October.

Under the terms of its Hong Kong government licence, Wharf is obliged
to carry ``regional'' premium pay channels from Star.  But it had been
refusing to distribute the four existing channels on the grounds that
they did not qualify as regional until they were transmitted by
satellite (NMM 11:22).

Star and Wharf had reached an outline arrangement for the carriage of
the pay channels -- and for three of the five clear channels that Star
is transmitting via Asiasat 1 -- as part of a wide-ranging contract that
was agreed in June 1993.  However, reaching a final and detailed
agreement became difficult after Murdoch's News Corporation purchased a
controlling stake in Star in July.

The discussions on the outline agreement broke down in January this
year when Wharf Cable began legal action to prove that the agreement
was not legally binding.  In advance of this case being heard in the
high court in Hong Kong, the two sides had begun discussions on a
completely new agreement.

However, Star now says that it cannot reach a ``workable arrangement''
with Wharf and has withdrawn from discussions, at least temporarily.
Wharf says that Star's move reflects its recognition that last June's
outline agreement is not legally binding.

But if Star is to launch new premium pay-television channels from
Asiasat 1 satellite -- as it says it will -- the two sides will have to
negotiate carriage terms or seek involvement of the Hong Kong
government in brokering a carriage deal.  Star's right to have Wharf
carry the premium pay-channels lasts three years and expires in June
1996.

Wharf believes that it can still reach an agreement with Star for the
carriage of premium and clear services.  A well-placed source said:
``We were talking until last week, we have no idea why they have
stopped talking, or what they want to do''.

Meanwhile, Wharf is seeking other arrangements for the supply of
channels to compensate for the loss of Star's clear services (Satellite
TV Finance 5:2).

Star has yet to decide a distribution strategy for the launch of its
premium pay services.  Its original plan was to use its spare
transponder on Asiasat 1 to broadcast the four channels using digital
compression.  It is understood that the plan was blocked by Murdoch,
who has bought a house in Hong Kong to spend time working directly on
Star TV.

BBC PREPARES FOR LAUNCH OF OVERSEAS THEME CHANNELS

The BBC's World Service Television this week put a little bit more
flesh on its plans to launch satellite channels around the world.  It
said that it is ``very seriously'' examining the idea of launching
themed channels of BBC product as well as news and information channels
in the near future.

The themed channels, consisting primarily of BBC product, would be
entire channels dedicated to a certain area, such as documentary or
comedy, or a group of ``strands'' branded as a single channel,
covering, for instance, wildlife, drama and music.

The channels, suggested by Bob Phillis, the BBC's deputy director
general, at a Financial Times conference last month, would be clustered
around WSTV's News and Information Channel, versions of which the BBC
hopes to launch in Europe and the USA this year.

Chris Irwin, WSTV chief executive, said this week that quality will be
of prime importance in the development of new channels because of the
importance of maintaining the BBC's reputation and brand worldwide.

The BBC increasingly sees its reputation as a marketable commodity,
since it gives both the BBC and its partners a head-start in new
markets.  Irwin argues that the BBC is more attractive to potential
distribution partners because of this head-start; the power of the
BBC's reputation is such that it can be expressed as a form of
investment in itself.

The reputation will be even more important in the multi-channel future.
 Irwin sees it developing as a kind of ``publisher's imprint'' -- a
recognisable name in what is likely to be a confusingly varied myriad
of channels.

Increasingly, it is the policy of the BBC to ``manage'' its brand-name,
to nurture it as a market commodity.  This lies behind much of the
BBC's strategy at home and abroad, and has distinct implications for
WSTV's new services.

For instance, the brand-name of the BBC is one factor in the type of
News and Information Channel it will launch in Europe and the USA; the
other factor is that the market for new channels in both territories is
limited.

In both the USA and Europe, the BBC will aim for a very defined (and
closely researched) market.  It is not seeking to compete directly with
what is already available, both for reasons of market share and because
the perceived quality and tone of BBC news provision would not be
appropriate for this kind of head-on competition with the likes of CNN;
it would require a major change in emphasis, and a consequent major
shift of how the BBC's brand is perceived in those territories.
Likewise, the BBC will not seek to compete with the domestic news
services of Europe.

Irwin says that WSTV has identified a significant minority in Europe
and the USA, primarily among AB social groups, with an international
outlook and an interest in an alternative news source.  The minority is
mainly to be found among the academic, media and business sectors.  The
new services will be adapted from the existing News and Information
Channel specifically for this audience.

Irwin uses the analogy of The Economist to explain BBC strategy in the
two markets: to develop and consolidate a niche among the most
influential and powerful social strata, without competing directly with
existing media.

WSTV is also pouring more money into developing its own news-gathering
service, distinct from the domestic service.  Most of its news is still
either commissioned from news agencies or adapted from domestic service
bulletins, but the proportion of news produced directly by WSTV is
increasing and Irwin would like to see this continue.

WSTV is now in the middle of a training programme designed to provide
BBC World Service Radio's reporters with TV experience; in addition,
the imminent launch of WSTV's Arabia service, to be transmitted in
Arabic, is forcing WSTV to create its own Arabic news-gathering service
which, Irwin maintains, ``will be the best in the world.''

WSTV, which is embroiled in a legal dispute over carriage of its News
and Information Channel on Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, is ``re-gaugeing
the competitive environment'' in Asia.

WSTV said recently that it wanted to maintain the Star relationship as
long as possible, and that constructive talks were taking place between
the two parties.  Two weeks ago, Phillis said that either party could
drop out at the end of 1994, but that he hoped the relationship would
continue.

Irwin now says that ``Star is not the only player in Asia,'' adding
that ``there is a deep and growing concern about any one individual
controlling the global gateways, in other words subscriber management
and services.  Rupert Murdoch is a very strong partner to have, because
of his knowledge of the market, but there are other partners.''

There are a number of options, which could include joining the group of
channels which is setting up in opposition to Star on the Apstar
satellites.  Alternatively, the BBC could go it alone and start
broadcasting from one of the new satellites, Apstar 1 and 2 and Asiasat
2.

HOW BIG IS BSKYB'S BILL FOR BRITISH SCREEN FILMS?

BSkyB would have paid between #262,966 and #279,113 for UK pay-
television rights to the highly successful UK feature The Crying Game,
had its new output agreement with British Screen Finance, the
government-backed film subsidy body, been up and running in 1991/92.
It would also have paid at least #385,687 for Orlando and at least
#413,750 for Damage.

These prices have been calculated on the basis of the payment terms set
out in the deal, signed two weeks ago, which will give BSkyB the UK pay-
television rights to at least 30 British Screen-supported features over
three years.  These terms set out formulae under which the prices of
the rights to each film are calculated according to its production
budget and its cinema box-office takings.

There is a basic price for the main pay-television window, which will
open between 15 months and 18  months after the film's theatrical
release, last for between 11 and 12 months, and provide for 12
screenings.  This price includes two elements: an initial licence fee
equivalent to eight per cent of the production budget up to #2.5
million, and three per cent of the sum by which the budget exceeds #2.5
million; and an additional licence fee, equivalent to five per cent of
total box-office receipts (excluding VAT) in the UK and the Irish
Republic up to the point where the film passes to BSkyB.

There is an additional price for an optional second pay-television
window, which will open three years after a film's first broadcast on
free television.  This price is equivalent to five per cent of the
initial licence fee plus 10 per cent of the additional licence fee.

The Crying Game, which in world market terms is the most successful
film ever backed by British Screen, was made on a budget of #2.6
million.  So the initial licence fee would have been #203,000.  The
film has so far taken #1,453,726 at UK and Irish cinemas, according to
its distributors Mayfair, yielding a VAT-exclusive figure of
#1,199,324.  So the additional licence fee would have been #59,966.

Had BSkyB opted to buy a second pay-television window -- highly likely
given the international success of the feature, which earned director
Neil Jordan an Oscar for best original screenplay, and picked up three
other Oscar nominations -- it would have paid an additional #16,147.

The terms of the deal set a cap of #325,000 on the initial licence fee
that BSkyB will have to pay for any individual film in the first year
of the deal's operation.

It would not have had to pay this for any of the films shown here --
although it would have come close with both Orlando and Damage (each of
which had a budget of #6.6 million), where the initial fee would have
been #323,000 in each case.

In each case BSkyB's investment is substantially lower than the price
it was asked to pay in an earlier attempt to open up a pay-television
window for UK features.

Just over a year ago David Elstein, BSkyB's head of programming,
approached Channel Four with a bid to buy UK pay-television rights to a
package of features -- including The Crying Game -- in which the
terrestrial broadcaster had invested in return for equity and all
television rights in line with its normal practice.

But the terrestrial broadcaster effectively rejected the offer, saying
that BSkyB that would have to offer at least twice Channel Four's
initial licence fee -- believed to have been between #300,000 and
#500,000 in each case -- before such a bid would even be considered
(Satellite TV Finance 4:3).

Of the other examples shown, both No Worries and Blue Black Permanent
would have been excluded from the deal as currently constituted.  The
first because it has no theatrical distribution deal and the second
because its budget is below the #750,000 minimum stipulated in the
agreement.

ITC SUGGESTS CHANGES TO RULES ON CROSS-OWNERSHIP OF TV CHANNELS

The Independent Television Commission told Peter Brooke, National
Heritage secretary, who is reviewing cross-media ownership regulations,
that the restriction on a company owning more than two ITV franchise
licences should be replaced by a market-share limit of 25 per cent of
total television advertising revenue, including that of satellite and
cable television.  It also said that cross-media ownership rules could
be applied to satellite channels as satellite viewing increases.

The ITC said that newspaper groups should be able to have 30-per-cent
stakes in ITV companies, instead of the present 20-per-cent limit, and
that ITV companies should be able to have a 30-per-cent stake in the
planned Channel 5 instead of 20 per cent.  It criticised a rule which
limits ITV companies to a holding of less than 50 per cent of
Independent Television News.

DIVORCED TCI LOOKS TO BLOCKBUSTER

TeleCommunications Inc, fresh from the collapse of its merger with Bell
Atlantic, approached the Blockbuster video-rental company about
investing in it or becoming a partner if the company is not merged with
Viacom, as agreed during Viacom's bid for Paramount Communications.

TCI and Bell Atlantic blamed the collapse of their merger on the
Federal Communication Commission's cut of seven per cent in cable
rates.  However, both companies had already been arguing about the
price: this was aggravated by the decline in Bell Atlantic's share
price, which lowered the value of its offer.

UK FEATURE-FILM INVESTMENT CONTINUES TO RISE, DESPITE FOREIGN FALL OFF

Investment in films with UK production company involvement rose
significantly in 1995, despite a slight drop in the overall amount of
money put into UK-linked features.

A total of #309.54 million was invested in 76 UK-producer films -- that
is, wholly UK productions and international co-productions involving UK
companies -- that went into production between January 1 and December 31
last year.  Both figures were the highest for at least 15 years (using
current price comparisons).  The average budget was #4.07 million, the
best figure for at least four years.

The investment total represents a rise of 19.4 per cent on the #259.26
million spent on the 70 UK-producer films that went before the cameras
in 1994 (Screen Finance 8:1), and is 133.8 per cent higher than the
#132.4 million spent on 60 such films in 1993 (Screen Finance 7:1).

However, the amount of money invested in the five films shot by foreign
producers in the UK was only #111.25 million, 37 per cent less than the
#176.50 million put into eight such films in 1994 (although it was 38
per cent higher than the #81.3 million put into seven such films in
1993).

As a result, total investment in all UK-linked productions fell
slightly to #420.79 million.  This was 3.4 per cent lower than the
#435.76 million figure recorded in 1994, but still 97 per cent above
the #213.7 million invested in 1993.

The drop in overall investment came despite the fact that the total
number of 81 film starts was three more than in 1994 (Screen Finance
8:1), and 14 up on 1993 (Screen Finance 7:1).

But the relative lack of foreign films is likely to be a short-term
phenomenon, given the number of big-budget features that have
provisionally booked space in UK studios for this year.  These include
the $65 million Fifth Element, Cinergi/Really Useful Group's Evita and
Warner Bros' The Avengers (Screen Finance 8:17).

A total of 40 features were wholly UK in origin -- that is, they were
made solely by British production companies -- with a combined budget of
#169.59 and an average budget of #4.24 million.  Of these films, 35
were shot mainly or wholly in the UK and had a combined value of
#135.67 million.  The other five were shot mainly or wholly abroad and
represented a further investment of #33.92 million.

The level of investment in wholly British features is noticeably higher
than in 1994, when 38 such films were made (33 of them mainly or
entirely in the UK) with a combined budget of #110.96 million and an
average budget of #2.92 million.  In 1993 there were 31 films in this
category with a total value of #62.39 million (average #2.01 million).

There was also an increase in the number of international co-
productions involving UK producers.  There were 36 films in this
category last year, with a combined investment of #139.95 million
(average #3.89 million).  This compares with 32 co-productions in 1994
(total investment #148.30 million, average #4.63 million) and 29 in
1993 (total investment #68.01 million, average #2.35 million).

However, UK producers played the leading or equal role in only 11 of
last year's co-productions (of which only four were shot mainly or
wholly in Britain) with a combined value of #52.14 million (average
#4.74 million).  The remaining 25 co-productions, with a combined
budget of #87.81 million (average #3.51 million), had only a minority
UK involvement.  Given that 22 of these were shot mainly or wholly
abroad, it is likely that only a small proportion of this money will
have accrued to the UK production sector.

The generally positive picture for UK production is reflected in the
number of medium-to-large-budget UK films.  Last year 15 of the 76
films with UK-producer involvement (19.7 per cent) had budgets of #6
million or more.  While this is slightly down on the 1994 figure of 17
out of 70 (24.3 per cent) it is well up on the 1993 total of three out
of 60 (five per cent).

And last year's total includes four features with budgets of more than
#15 million -- the #20 million Fierce Creatures from Fish Productions
and Jersey Films, the #17 million Goldeneye from Eon Productions, the
#18 million Blood and Wine from Recorded Pictures (see below) and the
#15.5 million Pinocchio from Allied Pinocchio in collaboration with
Davis Films of France and Etamp Film Productions of the Czech Republic.
 Only the fourth of these was not a wholly British production.

This figure compares with two films in this category in 1994, one in
1993, and none in 1992.

Main investors

Polygram Filmed Entertainment was again one of the heaviest investors,
backing eight of the 76 films with UK-producer involvement -- Jude the
Obscure, Trainspotting, Walking and Talking, Dead Man Walking,
Pinocchio, The Eighth Day, The Pillow Book and This the Sea.  It also
backed one of the five foreign films shooting in Britain -- Portrait of
a Lady

Miramax, as usual, was the most active US backer, with money in five UK-
producer projects -- Brassed Off, Emma, I Love You -- I Love You Not, The
Last of the High Kings, and Snakes and Ladders.

Twentieth Century Fox had three UK-producer projects -- The Secret
Agent, Blood and Wine and Stealing Beauty.  Walt Disney also had three
in this category -- The Wind in the Willows, Firelight and La
propietaire (The Proprietor) -- plus two US projects shooting in the UK
-- The Muppet Treasure Island and 101 Dalmatians.

Three US investors backed two UK-producer projects each: United Artists
(Goldeneye and Richard III); Trimark (Proteus and Crimetime); and New
Line/Fine Line (Twelfth Night and Total Eclipse).

Single project investors included Universal (Fierce Creatures), Unapix
(The Proposition), Warner Bros (Surviving Picasso), Summit (Twelfth
Night), Visionary Communications (Two Blind Mice), Columbia Tristar
(The Wind in the Willows), Castle Rock (Othello), Kushner Locke
(Pinocchio), HBO Showcase (Deadly Voyage) and the Overseas Film Group
(This is the Sea).

Two other US companies backed foreign productions shooting in Britain --
Paramount (Mission Impossible) and October Films (Breaking the Waves).

As in other years there was an almost total lack of commercial UK
investors, other than the usual ones such as J&M Entertainment,
Majestic Films and Television and Capitol Films, with the occasional
distributor pre-buy from distributors such as Entertainment, First
Independent, Guild and Electric/Polygram.

Private investors are evident in a handful of films.  But only one of
these, the #4.5 million Grotesque, had a budget of more than #2
million.

One noticeable continuing trend is the decline of low-budget films
(those with budgets of less than #2 million).  This year 23 of the 76
UK-producer films (30.3 per cent per cent) fell into this category, and
16 of the 40 wholly-UK films (40 per cent).  This compares with the
1994 figures of 28 out of 70 UK-producer films (40 per cent) and 20 out
of 38 wholly-UK films (52.6 per cent).  In 1993 the figures were 34 out
of 60 (56.7 per cent) and 20 out of 31 (64.5 per cent per cent).

Last year also saw the first decline for some time in the number and
proportion of films depending on some members of the cast and crew
deferring their fees -- a practice which applies almost entirely to
wholly-UK films.

In 1995 only four of the 40 wholly UK films (10 per cent) relied to a
greater or lesser extent on this approach -- Bob's Weekend, Driven,
Respect and Two Blind Mice.  This compares with 14 out of 33 in 1994
(42 per cent) and 10 out of 28 in 1993 (36 per cent).

There was also one minority-UK co-production using deferrals last year
-- This is the Sea.

Subsidy money

Of the 76 features involving UK producers, 35 received some form of
public subsidy.  Thirty of these were international co-productions.

Far and away the most active body was Eurimages, the Council of
Europe's co-production fund, which backed 21 UK-producer projects
(including five in which the UK company was the lead producer).
Unfortunately, this line of finance is now being closed following the
UK government's decision last November to withdraw from the fund (see
separate story on page 12).

Of the UK sources, British Screen Finance provided backing from its
main fund for four films -- The Near Room, Nothing Personal (formerly
All Our Fault), Richard III and Sweet Angel Mine (Screen Finance 8:23).

The European Co-production Fund, which is administered by British
Screen, has supported five films -- Total Eclipse, This is the Sea, The
Killer Tongue, Portraits Chinois and The Castle of the Monkeys.

A key emerging UK source is the Arts Council of England (ACE), which
provides National Lottery money for film production and backed three of
the films that went into production last year -- A Midsummer Night's
Dream, The Woodlanders and Crimetime.  The ACE, and the parallel Arts
Councils of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have also provided
Lottery money for a number of forthcoming productions (Screen Finance
8:22).

Other bodies providing funds included the Glasgow Film Fund, which
backed The Near Room, Small Faces (aka Easterhouse) and Carla's Song.

Television finance

As usual, there was also a major contribution from television companies
both from the UK and other European countries.  At least 43 of the 76
UK-producer films received support from one of these sources.

Channel Four, as in previous years, was by far the most active.  It
backed 19 films that went into production in 1995, compared with 12 in
1994 and eight in 1993.  These were Beautiful Thing, Brassed Off,
Guardians, Indian Summer, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Trainspotting, The
Woodlanders, Walking and Talking, Carla's Song, Crimetime, The Hollow
Reed, A Further Gesture, The Disappearance of Finbar, Trojan Eddie,
Truth (aka Mike Leigh's Untitled '95), Nothing Personal, Portraits
Chinois, La proprietaire and The Pillow Book.  The Welsh Channel Four,
S4C, backed one film, The Proposition.

The BBC backed six films compared with four in 1994 and two in 1993.
Last year's films were Different for Girls (aka Crossing the Border),
Jude the Obscure, Small Faces, Twelfth Night, Deadly Voyage and Swann.

BSkyB backed six films -- The Bruce, Richard III, The Near Room, Sweet
Angel Mine (aka Love's Executioner), The Castle of the Monkeys, This is
the Sea -- mostly through its output deal with British Screen.

However, no films received investment from any of the ITV companies.

Canal Plus, the French pay-television channel, backed three co-
productions involving UK companies -- I Love You -- I Love You Not, The
Butterfly Effect, and The Castle of the Monkeys.  It also backed the
foreign-produced Breaking the Waves.

Two other European broadcasters, RTE of Ireland and TVE of Spain, also
backed three co-productions each.

EC FINALLY ISSUES CALLS FOR IO TENDERS

The European Commission last week finally published its long-awaited
calls to tender for the contracts to run the four Intermediary
Organisations (IOs) that are to be set up under the Media II
initiative, successor to the Media Programme which officially came to
an end last month.

Final discussion of the IO tenders took place at the December 15
meeting of the Media Committee and the documents were made public on
January 5.  These call for applications to be submitted by February 23.
 The EC is hoping that the winners will be selected by mid-April (ahead
of the start of the Mip-TV programme market on April 19), and that the
IOs will begin operation by May or June.

However, the documents say that tenderers must keep their proposals
open until November 23, suggesting that there are fears that the
selection process could be considerably extended.

The EC is now hoping to issue the invitations for bids from potential
beneficiaries -- that is, the call for potential end users to apply for
Media II funds -- by the end of this month.  Various draft proposals
were discussed at the December 15 of the old Media Committee, and will
be considered further at the January 22 meeting of the new Media II
Committee which is to replace it (but which is likely to have
essentially the same membership).

The delayed date for issuing the call for bids for the first round of
funds will almost inevitably put back the timetable for submissions.
For instance, it will be very difficult to maintain the timetable of
submitting bids for training projects in February, to be followed by
decisions in March (Screen Finance 8:23).

The January 22 meeting is also due to discuss the rules and regulations
for the governing of the Committee itself.

The Committee has been strengthened according to EC ``commitology''
lore, improving its role from a purely advisory one to something with a
few more teeth.  The result is that the Committee can advise on more
decisions, and has to be consulted each time that a project is in
excess of the budgetary ceilings laid down by the Council of Ministers
-- Ecu200,000 for training, Ecu300,000 for development, and Ecu500,000
for distribution (Screen Finance 8:22).

If the Committee and the Commission disagree on a matter of policy, the
Council of Ministers will be informed.  In such an event, the
Commission must defer taking action on the point for two months.  The
Council can then decide on a different course, should it disagree with
the Commission's position.

IO tenders

The EC documents say that contracts for the four IOs -- covering the
areas of training, development, distribution and management/finance --
will be awarded for an initial year, which will then be extendable on
an annual basis to take the total to a maximum of five years.  At the
beginning of each contract, the IOs will be paid 30 per cent of the
year's forecast expenditure.  Actual costs will be reimbursed on a
quarterly basis.

Tender proposals will have to address every aspect of the Commission's
desires for each specific IO.  Any proposal that does not will be
rejected.

In addition, the Commission published the implementation decisions of
the Council of Ministers which describe the events which led to the
establishment of each programme, the aims of the programmes, the
percentage of funding they can contribute to projects they support, and
the role of the Media II Committee in each initiative.  The plans cover
a five-year span from January 1 1996 to December 31 2000.

Distribution and development

The distribution and development programme will have a combined five-
year budget of Ecu265 million.  It will have two separate IOs.  Tenders
for these IO contracts will be judged on the quality of the work
schedule put forward, the tenderer's specific expertise in the areas of
audiovisual development and distribution, the ability to respond
quickly to the Commission, and financial conditions.

Beneficiaries under this scheme must supply 50 per cent of their
project funding themselves.

The Commission estimates that the distribution and development IOs will
generate the following number of contracts per year:

Theatrical distribution      225
Video publishing              50
Television broadcasting       50
Promotion/market access       20

Total contracts              345

The distribution and development IOs will have two calls for proposals
each year, and two selection jury meetings.

The distribution IO should be designed to strengthen European cinema
and video distribution by improving networking, encouraging the
transnational distribution of European film product, and promoting the
worldwide circulation of European television programming.  It should
focus on video publishing, television broadcasting and supporting
networks of cinema theatres programming European films.  In addition
the distribution programme is geared toward active support of
linguistic diversity in the audiovisual sector as well as the promotion
of independent European production.

In the development area, the aim is to offer financial and technical
assistance to the development of production projects.  The development
mandate specifically mentions the promotion of animation via new
technology.  The development IO is intended to provide support for
production projects, the development of European production companies,
and the creation of industrial platforms in new technologies, animation
and the enhancement of the audiovisual heritage.

Media training programme

The training programme will have a five-year budget of Ecu45 million.
Its mandate is to give audiovisual industry professionals the skills
they need to ``manage projects and businesses that make a real impact
on the market.''  The idea is for the training part of the programme to
support professional training in the areas of economic and commercial
management and new technologies in two ways.  The first involves long-
term post-graduate courses as well as training courses for trainers.
The second involves shorter-term training modules for the continuing
education of industry professionals.

The Commission hopes that the training network fostered by this
initiative will create a forum for the exchange of all kinds of ideas
that will help the European audiovisual sector to stay competitive in
the global marketplace. Recipients of funding under the training scheme
will have to put up 50 per cent of their budget themselves, or 25 per
cent in very special (and as yet unspecified) cases.

The Commission estimates that the training IO will make two calls for
proposals each year and have two selection jury meetings.  It is
anticipated that the training IO will generate 80 contracts per year.

Management IO

The management IO will be a Brussels-based organisation which will
assist in the management and financial planning for Media II as a
whole.

It is still a somewhat controversial topic, as it is not clear what
sort of jurisdiction, if any, the management IO will have over the
other IOs.

Overall IO duties

The following is a general list of how the Commission views the duties
of the various IOs:

General tasks:

1. Advice on measures to be taken

2. Processing of project submissions

3. Setting up and operation of a database

4. Setting up an information, publication and distribution system

UK FURY OVER PLANS TO CHANGE TELEVISION DIRECTIVE

The UK's Department of National Heritage has reacted angrily to several
amendments to the European Union's transfrontier broadcasting directive
which were adopted this week by the European Parliament's culture
committee.

The DNH described as ``just bloody stupid'' an amendment which would
give broadcasting jurisdiction to the countries receiving a particular
channel instead of to the country in which the broadcaster is
established.

The DNH said that the amendment goes against the underlying principle
of the directive: this is that member states should accept broadcasts
which are properly licensed for distribution in another member state.

The UK was also angry at the latest in a long line of attempts to
tighten up the directive's requirement that channels should have at
least 51 per cent of programming made in Europe.  The DNH said that
amendments passed by the committee went against a ``political
agreement'' between the member states to stick with the existing
wording.

However, the council of culture ministers, which was responsible for
the wording of the directive sent to the parliamentary committee, will
get a further chance to quash the changes.

The amendment made this week by the parliamentary committee threw out
the controversial phrases ``where practicable'' and ``progressively on
the basis of suitable criteria'', which the UK and some other states
have used to justify a relaxed interpretation of the quota requirement.
 They replaced them with a clear three-year timetable for compliance.

Another amendment disqualifies certain new types of light entertainment
programming from counting towards a broadcaster's 51-per-cent quota.

However, the DNH welcomed the committee's rejection of several other
controversial amendments, including one which would have banned
advertising breaks during programmes aimed at children, and another
which would have required a health warning before advertisements for
alcoholic drinks on television.

The amended directive will be considered by the full parliament on
February 12.  But the committee has still not finished going through
the 225 amendments proposed by euro-MPs: another 20 will be considered
at a meeting next Tuesday.  The committee has so far adopted 51
amendments.

The full parliament is expected to reject some amendments before
sending a revised draft to the council of culture ministers.  The
council will then attempt to reach a so-called ``common position'' on
the amended draft, which must then be submitted for final approval by
the parliament.

The most controversial of all the 1989 directive's provisions has been
the one requiring quotas of European-originated programmes.  After many
arguments between the UK which believes that the quotas should be
scrapped completely, and France, which believes they should be
tightened, the culture ministers eventually opted, at the end of last
year, to retain the directive's existing wording (NMM 13:42).

The DNH said that it is ``absolutely opposed'' to the latest amendment
under which certain light-entertainment programmes would not count
towards the quotas.  Talk shows made in Europe, for instance, would not
be eligible.  The DNH said that the amendment, if adopted, would remove
``a lot of investment and employment which is generated by these
shows'' in Europe, and would leave only drama, documentaries and films
to contribute to the quotas.   At present, many general entertainment
channels balance the (mainly US) films they show with European talk
shows.

A senior commission official denied that the amendment would hit soap
operas such as Coronation Street and EastEnders, despite the fears of
some UK regulators and television executives.  He said that these would
still count towards the quotas.  However, he added that the council and
the parliament are heading towards a collision on quotas and that there
would ``have to be a compromise'' to resolve it.

Neither the UK nor the commission is happy with the amendment which
switches jurisdiction of broadcasters to the countries receiving the
broadcasts.  The DNH said: ``If you give the receiving country
jurisdiction, you're multiplying the number of countries with
jurisdiction in a way which would make the whole thing unworkable.''

A senior commission official said that ``it is not to be taken for
granted that the parliament will accept what the committee has
proposed''.  It is thought likely that the amendment will be rejected,
either by the parliament or when the draft is returned to the council
of ministers.

The UK is also opposed to an amendment which would extend the scope of
the directive to cover ``point-to-point'' services, such as video-on-
demand.  It said that these services should properly be considered
separately under telecoms legislation.

NOVEMBER ADMISSIONS FALL BY 5.2 PER CENT

UK cinema admissions for the whole of 1995 now seem set to reach a
total about nine per cent below the record figure returned in 1994,
which saw admissions rise by 9.7 per cent in comparison with 1993.

According to figures from the Cinema Advertising Association (CAA),
November admissions to cinemas taking advertising totalled 8,498,275, a
fall of 5.2 per cent on the record figure of 8,960,554 admissions
recorded for November a year ago (Screen Finance 8:1), but ahead of the
November 1993 figure of 7,619,875 (Screen Finance 7:1).

Admissions to cinemas not taking advertising -- the National Film
Theatre and about half the British Film Institute-supported Regional
Film Theatres -- added about another 85,000 to take the all-cinemas
total for November to around 8.6 million admissions.

Average weekly admissions for November were 1.98 million, among the
lowest figures for 1995, but a strong performance for the month when
compared to other November results, coming in second only to last
year's November weekly average of 2.09 million.

The total number of visitors to CAA-monitored advertising cinemas in
the first 11 months of the year was 104,244,582, down 9.8 per cent on
the comparable figure of 115,540,746 for November 1994 (Screen Finance
8:1), and only 352,637 admissions ahead of the corresponding 1993
figure of 103,891,945.

According to Screen Finance estimates, admissions to non-advertising
cinemas add another 1.08 million to take the end-November total for
1995 to approximately 106 million.

The top-grossing film of November was Goldeneye, the first Bond film in
six years, which opened on November 24, and took #5,554,527 in its
first week.  It was followed by Crimson Tide, which opened on November
3 and took #4,221,056 for the month.  Other strong performers in
November were Disney's Pocahontas (with #2.3 million), the UK/USA co-
production French Kiss (with #1.8 million) and To Die For (with #1.5
million).

End-1995 results

According to Catherine Booth-Clibborn of the CAA, December 1995
admissions are expected to top the 1994 result for the month, thanks to
several strong performers at the box office.

UIP's Goldeneye has continued to perform well at the box office, taking
over #9.2 million during December, and taking third place in the list
of top box office performers for the year with #14,785,676, just behind
Batman Forever and Casper.

Other strong box offices performers were Babe, The Santa Clause, and
Ace Ventura -- When Nature Calls, which took #3.2 million in its first
week.

If the December 1995 admissions figure does indeed exceed that for the
same month in 1994, this would imply a total of about 8 million,
bringing the end-of-year total to about 112.3 million for advertising
cinemas.  Given the Screen Finance estimate of approximately 1.2
million admission for 1995 for non-advertising cinemas, this would take
the end-of-year total to about 113.5 million, only 8.6-per-cent lower
than the total admissions figure for 1994.

UK FILM PRODUCTION

There was only one production start last month -- one more than last
year.  This was the #3.1 million A Further Gesture, a UK-led co-
production by CSL Films in partnership with with Samson Films of
Ireland and Road Movies of Germany.

This film, which went before the cameras in Dublin on December 3, is
backed by Channel Four, Pandora of Germany and Nippon Film and
Development (NDF) of Japan.  It is also receiving subsidies from
Eurimages, the Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen and the Irish Film
Board, and has some investment raised through Ireland's section 35 tax-
incentive scheme.

A Further Gesture is directed by Robert Dornhelm from a Ronan Bennett
script, and produced by Chris Curling.  It stars Stephen Rea as an
escaped IRA prisoner on the run in New York, who finds himself caught
up in a plot to carry out a political assassination.  After its initial
three weeks in Dublin, the film is scheduled to continue shooting in
New York for five weeks from mid-January.

Two other films started in November but were omitted from the Screen
Finance list for the month (Screen Finance 8:22).

One is the latest Recorded Pictures production Blood and Wine, which is
being directed by Bob Rafelson from a script he wrote in collaboration
with Nick Villiers, and produced by Jeremy Thomas.  It went into
production on November 27 in Miami, Florida.  The #18 million film is
backed by Twentieth Century Fox, which has taken English-speaking
rights, and by Majestic Film and Television, which is handling sales in
the rest of the world.

Blood and Wine stars Jack Nicholson, Judy Davis, Michael Caine, Stephen
Dorff and Jennifer Lopez.  Nicholson plays a womanising wine dealer
whose weaknesses have brought him to desperate straits.  He devises the
perfect crime to solve his financial problems at a stroke.

The other film was Firelight, a majority UK-co-production between
Carnival Films and Wind Dancer Productions of the USA, which began
shooting from November 27 at Pinewood, and from January 3 to mid-
February in Sussex and Normandy.

The #5.15 million feature is directed by William Nicholson, produced by
Brian Eastman of Carnival and executive-produced by a five-person team
from Wind Dancer, led by Matt Williams.  It is backed by Hollywood
Pictures.  The film stars Sophie Marceau, Stephen Dillane and Kevin
Anderson.  It tells the story of a beautiful Swiss governess and an
English landowner who meet in secret to fulfil the terms of a business
agreement; the encounter lasts three days, and awakens a desire that
changes their lives for ever.

DNH PONDERS DECISION ON EURIMAGES FUNDING ROUND

The UK's Department of National Heritage will have to decide in the
next month whether it is prepared to amend its stance on Eurimages, the
Council of Europe co-production fund from which it controversially
decided to withdraw last November.

The DNH, which has seen its decision come under strong criticism from
UK film-makers and other Eurimages members, has been told that it will
have to provide more money if it wants UK-linked projects to be
considered for backing at the next funding meeting of the Eurimages
board of management, which is scheduled for February 6 and 7.

Twelve of the projects on the agenda have UK producers.  Many of them
had already submitted their applications when the DNH make its shock
withdrawal announcement on November 29 (Screen Finance 8:22).  While
some of these applications will be withdrawn for various reasons in the
next few weeks, half can be expected to remain on the list by the time
the meeting convenes.

Eurimages has told the DNH that if it wants UK-linked projects to be
eligible for this funding round, the first of five in 1996, then it
will have to provide at least one fifth of its projected subscription
for the year.  This would be about #450,000 at current exchange rates.
Under this arrangement, the UK's active membership would end after the
February meeting, although according to the rules of Eurimages, its
actual membership would continue until the end of the year.

But the DNH is proposing to pay only #300,000 -- representing the
remainder of the money that it had allocated for Eurimages out of its
budget for 1995-96 (the UK government operates on the year to the end
of March, whereas Eurimages operates on the calendar year).

So the DNH appears to be faced with a choice between finding another
#150,000 to satisfy the Eurimages requirement for the February meeting,
or taking back its #300,000 and leaving the UK producers high and dry.
But it may be able to negotiate a compromise.

The other 23 members of Eurimages say that the UK should pay the whole
of its subscription for 1996, because it has not followed the correct
procedure for withdrawing from the organisation (Screen Finance 8:23).
These countries concede that they cannot actually force the UK to
comply, but say that it is likely to come under considerable diplomatic
pressure if it does not do so.

UK film-makers argue that the withdrawal decision should be reversed
altogether.  This view was strongly put to the national heritage
secretary Virginia Bottomley at a meeting with leading film-makers
organised by the Producers' Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact)
on December 21.

The meeting was attended by Lord Attenborough, chairman of the British
Screen Advisory Council (BSAC), Simon Perry, chief executive of British
Screen Finance, Andrew Quinn, chairman of the British Film Commission,
Sir Sydney Samuelson, the British Film Commissioner, Wilf Stevenson,
director of the British Film Institute, John Woodward, chief executive
of Pact, Fiona Clarke-Hackston, director of BSAC, David Norris of law
firm Marriott Harrison, who is vice-chairman of film at Pact, Simon
Relph of Skreba and Greenpoint, who is vice-chairman of film at the
British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta), Steve Woolley of
Scala Productions, who is a council member of Bafta, and Richard Holmes
of Gruber Brothers, representing the New Producers' Alliance.

The purpose of the meeting was for these UK film industry
representatives to express their frustration and disappointment with
the policy decision.  Having ``expressed their views forcefully'',
according to one participant, the group is now awaiting Bottomley's
response, promised for the New Year.

If Bottomley refuses to budge, the consequences for UK producers could
be fairly dire.  Already, 11 projects have dropped a UK co-producer
from their roster because non-members are not eligible for Eurimages
funds, according to Barrie Ellis-Jones, the British executive secretary
of Eurimages, who has himself felt obliged to resign as a result of the
DNH decision.

UK executives believe that there may be some room for negotiation on
the point of how much the UK should pay for its annual subscription.
``It's likely it is not just a matter of money, but a matter of the
handling of the event,''  according to Clarke-Hackston.  ``I still
believe DNH could go to Eurimages and say they've got a budgetary
problem.  They would have to make it clear that the UK would stay in
for a specified number of years, but I don't think the situation cannot
be resolved.''

But Eurimages president Gaetano Adinolfi says that it would be
impossible to reduce the UK's annual subscription.  He says that every
year the total Eurimages budget has grown according to the voluntary
increases agreed to by all of its members.  Last year the UK
contributed FFr19.5 million to the total Eurimages budget of FFr160
million.  Even without the UK's presence, the 1996 budget should run to
about FFr140 million, representing an increase for the remaining
members.

Adinolfi made clear his opinion of the UK move shortly after it was
announced six weeks ago: ``Every member of the Council of Europe has a
free choice of whether to be a member of the Fund or not.  However, I
have been working in the Council for over 40 years and I do not
remember anything of this kind happening before.''

EURO AIM TALKS DRAG ON, WITH AUDIT AND LEGAL ACTION

Euro Aim, the Media 95-backed initiative to support independent
European production, is still negotiating with the European Commission
in an attempt to resolve the long-running dispute over the EC's refusal
to hand over the money the agency says it is owed.

Euro Aim says that the EC owes it Ecu3.7 million, representing the
remainder of the Commission's contribution to the agency's 1994 budget
and the whole of its contribution to the 1995 budget.

Although Euro Aim reopened after Christmas on January 8 with its staff
still essentially intact, except for a few who had been employed under
limited term contracts, the organisation is weeks away from bankruptcy,
according to executives.  The Commission supplies 42 per cent of Euro
Aim's total budget, and without its contribution, the agency has had to
suspend its attendance at any of the important television and film
markets where it had functioned as an umbrella organisation for
independent European producers.

Euro Aim, which initiated legal action against the Commission on
December 4, had a court hearing scheduled for December 15 (Screen
Finance 8:23).  But neither side was willing this week to comment on
the status of the court action, which is bound up in the settlement
negotiations.

The talks are also linked to the outcome of the audit of Euro Aim's
books which the EC had demanded as a prerequisite before handing over
any funds.  This audit, which was carried out by the Commission's
accountants in collaboration with an outside firm of auditors, was
completed in the week before Christmas (Screen Finance 8:22).  But
neither side is willing to discuss the results.

Although Euro Aim has not been able to attend any markets without EC
funding, it is continuing talks on a proposed joint venture to create
an electronic trading system which could very well lessen the
importance of such events.  The online system would allow producers and
distributors to access real-time information concerning film and
television productions in development.

Euro Aim is partnered in the venture by the Dutch electronics giant
Philips.  The two are seeking other collaborators after losing their
third partner last month as a result of the EC row (Screen Finance
8:22).  Executives expect within the next month to compete the business
plan for the scheme -- which envisages a three-year start up phase
during which a commercial network of users will be brought together.

BRITISH SCREEN PLANS NORTH-WEST SHORTS STRAND

British Screen Finance (BSF) is furthering its commitment to a regional
focus for its short film funding scheme with the initiation of Short
Wave, a northwest-oriented strand modelled on the Prime Cuts programme
which is already under way in Scotland.

British Screen is setting up the north-west strand in partnership with
Granada Television and the Merseyside-based Moving Image Development
Agency (Mida).  It is intended to fund the production of six short
films, each of which will last twelve-and-a-half minutes and will have
a budget of #30,000.

The Short Wave strand, like the Scottish one, is being set up on a one-
off basis, but is likely to be repeated next year.  Other regional
strands are likely to be set up in the near future, possibly including
strands in Northern Ireland, Wales and the south-east.

The various strands are being set up to replace the Short and Curlies
programme which BSF used to fund in partnership with Channel Four.  BSF
withdrew from this programme last year, partly because it wanted to
develop projects with a more regional edge (Screen Finance 8:4).  It
also wanted to spread its annual shorts budget -- currently running at
about #150,000 -- over more projects.  The four or five projects backed
each year under Short and Curlies had budgets of about #90,000 each.
The projects backed under the new strands will have budgets of no more
than a third of this.

The three partners in Short Wave are still hammering out the final
details of their agreement.  But Granada has pledged #60,000 to the
programme, according to Mike Spencer, the executive in charge of the
company's participation, leaving the remaining #120,000 or so to be
divided between the other two.  Mida will contribute money from its
``Objective I'' fund, which is part-backed by the European Regional
Development Fund (Screen Finance 8:15).  It will also be running the
strand's publicity programme it expects to launch later this year.

Writers will be invited to submit scripts from the beginning of next
month, with a deadline in April.  The partners expect to start filming
over the summer.  The films will air on Granada in the autumn, most
likely on a weekly transmission after the News at Ten,
although a one-hour compilation would be another possibility.

The partners will be looking for fictional scripts (comedy or drama) of
which some may be animations.  The films will also have a ``northwest
feel'' to them.  ``There will probably be no restrictions as to age,
background or experience, says Spencer.  ``But the films will have to
be about the northwest. It would help particularly if the talent was
from the northwest.''  Roger Shannon, the head of Mida, says that
projects are expected to come from northwest-based writers and
directors.

The Scottish Prime Cuts initiative, which was BSF's first regional
short film project, also involves three partners -- BSF, Scottish
Television and the Scottish Film Production Fund.  This scheme, which
was set up last April,  involves six projects, each of which will last
five minutes and will have a budget of #23,000.  These projects, which
were chosen in October, will be shot in February and March and will
subsequently be shown on Scottish Television.

The total funding for the programme is #160,000, including #140,000 for
production and #20,000 for administration, publicity and promotion.  Of
this total, about #60,000 was provided by the Scottish Film Production
Fund, using some of the National Lottery money it has been allocated by
the Scottish Arts Council.  The other #100,000 was divided evenly
between BSF and Scottish Television.

One of the benefits of the programme for Scotland, according to
Catherine Aitken, project developer at the Scottish Film Production
Fund, is that it has brought British Screen's head of development
Steven Cleary into the region with more frequency, thus drawing to his
attention the wealth of burgeoning Scottish talent.  ``It is a good
thing for Scotland,'' says Aitken.  ``The response to Prime Cuts and
the quality of the applications reflect what is happening in the
Scottish film industry.''

The six projects for this year's strand were chosen from a short-list
of 18 which was itself whittled down from an original list of 175
applications.

All of the projects had to be based in Scotland, using Scottish crews.
But the themes could be universal.  Although there were no specific
criteria on gender, it has turned out that three of the six films are
to be directed by women.  All of the films are dramas, and none are
animated.

UK MULTIPLEX MARKET SET FOR NEW SURGE OF GROWTH

The UK multiplex market, which has been experiencing fairly steady
expansion for the past three or four years, with about six new
multiplexes being opened every 12 months, could be set for a new spurt
of growth if operators' current plans come to fruition.

UK operators say that they are planning to open 22 new sites in 1996,
with a total of 201 screens, to take the installed base to 101 sites
with 907 screens.  A further 16 sites are already planned for 1997.

This would represent a growth rate that would be considerably higher
than the one enjoyed in the boom period of 1989-91, when operators were
launching an average of 14 sites a year.

The current expansion plans involve a mixture of larger multiplexes,
with up to 14 screens, together with smaller multiplexes of between
five and eight screens, representing two distinct operator approaches.

The large operators, which have plans for 15 multiplexes in 1996, with
a further 11 already on the books for 1997, are concentrating on large
sites.  They are attempting to reach an audience which traditionally
does not visit cinemas regularly by including several leisure
activities in one place, so that a visit to the multiplex can be
combined with a meal or even some shopping.  They also aim to expand
their audience by covering the market more thoroughly, building in
areas which do not have easy access to traditional cinemas and offering
more variety in mainstream movies.

The smaller operators are looking at smaller sites with a view to
expanding in the art market, which they see as under-exploited.  Peter
Buckingham, managing director of Oasis Cinemas, thinks that the art
market could benefit from some form of expansion, whether through the
opening of smaller multiplexes or through more traditional cinemas,
which would give more people access to art films.

Six in 1995

For the third year running, there were six multiplexes opened in the UK
in 1995, four by large chains and two by smaller independents.  These
sites represent an increase of 44 screens, to which two further screens
were added by a National Amusements expansion to an existing site.

Among the large operators, Odeon Cinemas and Warner Bros Theatres each
opened two new multiplexes in 1995.  Warner Bros launched an eight-
screen 1,900-seater in Cambridge in June and a nine-screen 2,500-seat
multiplex in Leicester in July.  The Odeon chain opened one in Hemel
Hempstead in August, with nine screens and 1,600 seats, and one in
Lincoln in November, with six screens and 1,000 seats.

Among the smaller operators, Apollo Leisure opened its first multiplex
in Rhyl, with five screens and 750 seats, and now has plans for at
least four more multiplexes over the next two years.  And Oasis Cinemas
opened the five-screen Ritzy in Brixton, which has 830 seats and is
aimed mainly at filling a gap in the art market.

The other change in the multiplex landscape in 1995 was the addition of
two screens to the National Amusements' multiplex in Coventry, taking
the number of screens to 14 and the number of seats to 4,440.  This
type of conversion seems to be one of the main trends for the future.

One further multiplex which had been planned for the end of 1995
(Screen Finance 8:12), the Film Network six-screener planned as part of
the new Nynex Arena in Manchester, has been put back to 1996.

These openings take the total number of multiplexes to 79 with 706
screens.  Multiplexes thus account for 10.4 per cent per cent of the
762 sites in the UK and 34.3 per cent of the 2,057 screens.

Future developments

One of the most active developers is Odeon, with seven projects on its
books for 1996: a five-screen project in Camden, a six-screen complex
in Wrexham, an eight-screen complex in Southend, two nine-screen 2,000-
seaters in Guildford and in Sunderland and a 12-screen complex planned
for Glasgow.  These new sites will, if they all go ahead, take the
number of Odeon multiplexes to 17 sites with 127 screens.

Another interesting operator to follow in 1996 and 1997 is Warner Bros,
which announced in August that it plans to build about 20 new
multiplexes in the UK, all with at least eight screens and 2,000 seats.
 This will involve investment of about #75 million in the London area,
and a further #65 million in the rest of the UK.

Bristol, 9 scrs, c2,000 seats (1997/98)

*these multiplexes are conversions, as opposed to new builds.

Two Warner sites are opening on January 17 -- one in Croydon, part of
the Valley Park Leisure Complex, and one in Watford.  They will be
followed by a nine-screen 2,200-seater in Harrow on April 26, an eight-
screen 2,000-seater in Finchley in July and a nine-screen 2,500-seater
in Dagenham in December.  If all of these go ahead on time, Warner will
have 17 multiplexes by the end of this year, with 152 screens.

In addition to these, Warner has plans for four further builds in 1997,
in Leeds, Glasgow, Meadowhall in Sheffield and in Bristol, which will
take the total to 21 sites with 188 screens.

Another strong investor in the multiplex market in 1996 will be the
start-up company Cine-UK, which has announced that it is planning to
invest #40 million into the UK market over the next few years on at
least 14 multiplex developments (Screen Finance 8:12).  In accordance
with their policy to invest in smaller catchment areas, a sector which
has not been the chosen target of other major operators, Cine-UK has
plans for four multiplexes in Ashford, Stevenage, Wakefield and
Wandsworth, each with between 10 and 14 screens and 1,900 and 3,000
seats.  All are scheduled to open in the last quarter of 1996.

United Cinemas International (UCI) has plans for two multiplexes in
1996, at Surrey Quays in London and in Leeds.  Both will have nine
screens with about 2,000 seats.  These would take the UCI total at end-
1996 to 26 sites and 243 screens, with an additional site planned at
Crystal Palace for a long delayed nine-screen multiplex to open in 1997
(Screen Finance 7:19).  UCI has also said that it is looking for
suitable sites for up to four additional projects.

Another large operator with plans for 1996 is National Amusements,
which is expecting to open a 14-screen development in Coatesbridge at
the end of the year, which would take its total to 12 sites and 157
screens.  In addition, according to Ed Knudsen, general manager of
advertising and publicity, the company is still developing a 14-screen
development in Reading and another in Newham, both scheduled for 1997.

The MGM chain, which was bought last year by the Virgin Group from
Credit Lyonnais for #195 million, is also planning to expand, initially
under its own name, although there are suggestions that it may take on
the Virgin banner in the long run.  Virgin/MGM has announced one build
for 1996, a nine-screen project in Rochester which will seat 2,256.
This will take the number of Virgin/MGM multiplexes to 19 with 143
screens.  In 1997, Virgin/MGM has plans for four nine-screen
multiplexes, in Oxford, Wigan, Aberdeen and Newport.

Of the smaller independent operators, in addition to the Film Network
development in Manchester, there are plans for four Apollo Leisure
multiplexes -- one 10-screen build in Huddersfield with 2,100 seats to
open in the autumn of 1996, two five-screens in Barrow and Gately, and
a six-screen conversion from a four-screen in Barrow, all expected for
some time in 1996/97.

Robins Cinemas is also planning three conversions, a five-screen at
Mile End for 1996, and two five-screens (from three) in 1997, one in
Camberley and the other in Basildon.  According to Ben Friedman,
managing director, this is part of a new ``policy of rationalisation in
the sites, investing in larger sites with more screens in larger towns,
rather than investing in smaller towns.''

This means that by the end of 1997, independent multiplex operators
will be running about 15 sites with 111 screens.

In addition to all these projects, one other operator, American Multi-
Cinemas (AMC) is expected to re-enter the UK market in the near future,
having announced plans to invest in up to 20 sites with 24 screens each
(Screen Finance 8:12).  AMC says that it is currently searching for
suitable sites in the UK but has not yet made any decisions on specific
projects.

LEADING FILM COMPANIES WANT COPYRIGHT CHANGES

European film companies are in danger of missing out on the
opportunities of the future unless copyright laws are amended to take
account of the digital age, according to the European Film Companies
Alliance (Efca), a group of seven leading European media conglomerates.

The group has this week been asking the European Commission -- which was
holding discussions on copyright with interested parties on January 8
and 9 -- to ensure the creation of a suitable legislative framework to
protect copyright, and the implementation of global rules to enforce
the rights of copyright owners.

Efca argues that Europe's position in the entertainment and cultural
sector will be determined by the level of copyright it grants to its
film companies.  It says that the USA has always had strong copyright
laws, and that this has been a significant factor in the strength of
the USA in the global entertainment market.

The members of the group -- Bertelsmann, Chargeurs, Ciby 2000, Polygram,
Rank, RCS and Sogepaq -- are concerned that the emergence of digital
transmission methods for films and music will soon make it impossible
for copyright owners to enforce their rights to payment for the user of
their works.  They say that if owners' investment is to be maintained,
it will be necessary to update the current legal definitions regarding
broadcasting, rental, distribution and reproduction in order to take
account of new digital technologies and consumer habits.

Efca argues that copyright protects the expression of intellectual
creation.  ``If the creative industries are prevented from realising a
commercial gain from the use of their products, they will have little
incentive to associate themselves with the information society.''  It
says that this could cost Europe dearly in terms of jobs and
investment.

The seven members say that there are three main issues that need to be
addressed regarding the electronic transmission of music and films:

* They argue that film companies should be granted the exclusive rights
to authorise or prohibit the distribution and copying of their material
on electronic networks such as the Internet.  This will enable them to
control the commercial usage of their productions.

* They maintain that these exclusive rights are essential if the
industry is to avoid the ``damaging'' principle of compulsory licensing
whereby companies are ``forced to sell their output at pre-determined
rates''.  They believe that it is much better to leave such matters to
the market.

* They say that copyright legislation can be effective only if it is
properly enforced, and that co-operation between the hardware and
creative industries will be essential in order to devise technological
standards for systems of protection.  Efca is calling on the Commission
to take a leading role in ensuring that this takes place, arguing that
legislation will be required in order for any such technical protection
to be effective.

NEW BODY CREATED TO AID MEDIA II TRAINING BIDS

A new trade association has been set up by a group of European
audiovisual industry professionals who share a common interest in the
possibility of proposing new independent training initiatives in
response to calls for tender under Media II.

The new body, which is known as the Trade Association for New Training
Initiatives (Tanti), is intended to provide a method of communicating
with the European Commission and national ministries on points of
interest and concern regarding the aims, target groups, content and
techniques of training as well as the procedure for the award of funds
under Media II (see separate story on page one).

The association, which is a loose grouping of individuals without any
officers, is also designed to provide a means of exchanging information
between members on the timing and procedures of calls for tenders,
expressions of interest, bids and the evaluation and results of bids.

The members of Tanti (which means numerous in Italian) are all people
who have taken part in training initiatives under the old Media
Programme and are considering participating in the new one as well.
They see the creation of the new body as a means of reminding the EC
that there are other people interested in offering training under Media
II apart from those involved in the existing structures.

The association contains a number of members in London, including
Michael Ryan and Matthew Payne of J&M Entertainment, Katrina Wood of
MediaXChange, John Durie of Strategic Film Marketing, Julian Friedmann
of Blake Friedmann, Sandy Lieberson of the National Film and Television
School and Angela Jackson of Angela Jackson Solicitor.

Others include Philippe Kern of Polygram and Geoffroy de Foestraets of
Coppens van Ommeslaghe Hormans & Fauras (both in Brussels), Luigi
Ferrara of Studio Legale Ferrara Santamaria (Rome), Jose Antonio Suarez
Lozano of Suarez de la Dehesa Abogados (Madrid), Margaret O'Connor of
Northern Arts (Newcastle), Kriton Metaxopoulos and Christine Pigaki of
A. Metaxopoulos Law Office (Athens) and Mathias Schwarz of Schwarz
Kurtze Schniewind Kelwing Wicke (Munich).

POLYGRAM TAKES FULL CONTROL OF GRAMERCY

Polygram Filmed Entertainment said this week it was taking full control
of Gramercy Pictures by buying Universal Pictures' 50-per-cent interest
in the company.

The deal, which involves an undisclosed sum, follows the expiry of the
initial three-year term of the joint venture between PFE and Universal.

Gramercy was set up by the two companies in May 1992 to handle the
North American marketing of distribution of theatrical films, and has
released such films as Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Usual Suspects
and Pricilla, Queen of the Desert.  The 14 or so films planned for this
year include Dead Man Walking, Farga and Portrait of a Lady.

Universal will continue to release a select number of films through
Gramercy including Grace of My Heart and Cold Comfort Farm.

UK BOX-OFFICE HOLDS STEADY AT #381 MILLION

The total amount taken at the UK box-office in 1995 was #381,361,499,
from 305 films on release.  The result is almost exactly the same as it
was the year before, when 299 films generated revenues of #381,871,307.

Given that admissions figures for the year are expected to be down by
about nine per cent (see separate story on page 5), this implies a
significant rise in average revenues per ticket.  This appears to be
due partly to an increase in prices, and partly to a relative absence
in 1995 of attractive children's films.

The statistics show that 186 US films were on release in the year,
grossing #319,157, 478 (83.69 per cent of the total) and averaging
#1,715,900 each.  Thirty two wholly-UK films were shown, earning
#32,954,094 (864 per cent) at an average of #1,029,815.  Seventeen UK
co-productions were on release, taking #6,881,635 (1.8 percent) at an
average of #404,802.

The figures thus continue to exhibit the distortion caused in 1994 by
the phenomenal success of the Rank/Polygram-distributed Four Weddings
and a Funeral, the most successful British film ever, which grossed #27
million, helping to push the UK share up to 10.53 per cent and US share
down to 85.63 per cent, compared with a usual level of more than 90 per
cent (Screen Finance 8:1).

The 1995 UK figures have also been skewed by the performance of a
single film - the UIP-distributed Goldeneye, which was released on
November 24 and had taken #14,785,676 by the end of December, or 3.88
per cent of the total box-office for the year.  This made it the third
most popular film of 1995 after Warner Bros' Batman Forever
(#20,013,560) and UIP's Caspar (#16,011,194).

The rest of the figures have been affected by the surprisingly strong
performance of the two Australian films which made in into the top 40 -
Muriels's Wedding (number 12 with #7,919,101) and Babe (number 18 with
#6,717,643).  The overall Australian total for the year was #14,720,199
(3.86 per cent).  The strong UK and Australian showings have combined
to keep the US share down.

But if Goldeneye is excluded, the remaining 31 wholly UK features
grossed only #18,168,418, for an average of #586,078.  This reflects
the fact that only three other UK films made it into the top 40 for the
year -- Shallow Grave (#5,078,079 and 23rd), The Madness of King George
(#4,258,079 and 28th), and Jack and Sarah (#3,195,793 and 40th).

No other non-US films made it into the chart.

Forty other European productions were on release over the year -- 28
national productions (15 from France) and 12 international co-
productions (with no UK participation).  The 40 films grossed
#5,196,465 (average #129,912), with the 12 co-productions taking
#2,392,725 (average #199,394).

The 30 releases from countries outside the USA and Europe earned
#17,171,826 (average #572,394).  But without the two top-rating
Australian films the figure would have been only #2,535,082 (average
#90,539).

The top distributor, as in previous years, was UIP.  Its 25 films
grossed #94,281,817 -- boosted by Caspar, Goldeneye and the fourth-
placed Apollo 13 -- to take 25.35 per cent of the market.

Next was Buena Vista, which released 32 films, more than anyone else,
helping to counter the fact that its top films Pocahontas and Die Hard
With a Vengeance came no higher than seventh and eighth in the chart.
It took a total of #77,759,690 (20.91 per cent).

In third place was Warner Bros with 24 releases and #68,047,766 (18.30
per cent).  Nearly half of this came from two films -- Batman Forever
and the sixth-placed Interview With the Vampire.

Fox was well behind with 17 releases and #24,654,826 (6.63 per cent).
This reflected the fact that after the fifth-placed Braveheart its next
best film was The Usual Suspects in 24th place.  Columbia Tristar
similarly had 18 releases and #23,483,992 (6.31 per cent).  Its best
film was Bad Boys in 22nd place.

No European company came anywhere near the top US-owned distributors.
None achieved more than six per cent of the market, and much of the
revenue they did get was due to a handful of films.

For instance, Guild was ranked sixth, with 13 releases taking
#19,394,278 (5.22 per cent).  But more than half of this was due to the
ninth-placed Stargate.  Similarly, Polygram (4.06 per cent) depended
heavily on Shallow Grave and Jack and Sarah, and First Independent's
2.97 per cent was almost entirely reliant on the performance of Dumb
and Dumber.

* The top film for the weekend of January 5-7 was Entertainment's
Seven, which took #2,628,821 from 300 screens over its first three
days.  This was the best opening since Goldeneye on November 24, and
contributed to a record-breaking aggregate of #7,408,828 over the
period (more than twice the figure recorded over the pre-Christmas
weekend).

This result put the Brad Pitt-Morgan Freeman thriller well ahead of
Warner Bros' Ace Ventura -- When Nature Calls, the new Jim Carrey
vehicle, which took #1,477,912 from 339 screens over its second
weekend, to take its total gross to #6,272,986.

Both films overtook the surprise Christmas hit Babe, distributed by
UIP, which had been at the top of the chart for the previous three
weeks.  Its most recent weekend take of #1,451,553 from 360 screens
took its total gross so far to #10,057,900.

Only one UK-linked film was released in the last four weeks -- Ate de
Jong's All Men are Mortal, a co-production led by Sigma Picture
Productions of the Netherlands in partnership with Nova Film of the UK
and Rio of France.  This film stars Stephen Rea and Irene Jacob, was
released by Warner on January 5 and took #2,490 from three screens over
its first weekend.

Apart from Babe, only four other non-US films were released over the
period.  Jean Cocteau's 1946 classic La Belle et la Bete was re-
released by the BFI on December 15 and took #14,141 before ending its
run two weeks later.  The White Balloon, the festival hit from Iranian
director Jafar Panahi, was released by Electric on December 29 and has
so far taken #37,241.

Jean-Paul Rappeneau's 1830s swashbuckler The Horseman on the Roof was
released by Artificial Eye on January 5 and took #49,920 from 14
screens over its first three days.  Lars von Trier's The Kingdom was
released by the ICA on the same day and gained a weekend take of #3,717
from once screen.

MASS APPEAL

Russia's reputation as a tricky place to do business has obscured the
success of its public and privately-owned broadcasters in serving an
increasingly demanding - and massive - audience. Chris Dziadul reports

Russia's embrace of free-market principles since the end of one-party
rule and the thawing of the cold war has not been without
complications. But the well-documented political and economic crises
afflicting the country have tended to overshadow the continued growth
of its tv industry.

Television services in Russia, especially at a local level, are
flourishing, and revenues from tv advertising - which only came into
existence in 1990 - now exceed $500 million a year.

In Moscow, viewers have a choice of 11 terrestrial channels including
ORT (formerly the national broadcaster Ostankino), RTR (Russian public
television), 2x2 (a music and entertainment station) and NTV (the
largest independent commercial network in the country), along with the
U.S.-backed microwave operator Kosmos TV. In St Petersburg the choice
is the same if not even greater thanks to the city's proximity to the
Nordic countries. Even some of Russia's remotest cities are now served
by local stations, and one (Nika TV in Petrozavorsk) boasts one of the
most sophisticated cable networks in the country.

Russia's two national publicly-owned broadcasters, ORT (Channel 1) and
RTR (Channel 2), are both having to adjust to the needs of an
increasingly selective tv audience. RTR, which can be received by 92.2%
of the population and almost four-fifths of the inhabitants of the
former Soviet Union - effectively 300 million people - was launched in
May 1991.

RTR shows a variety of programming ranging from the highly popular
Vesti news bulletin (regularly watched by two-thirds of all Russian
viewers) to Santa Barbara. Partly-privatized ORT, on the other hand,
took over the functions of Ostankino when it was declared bankrupt in
early 1995 and covers the entire area of the former Soviet Union.

While ORT is still in a transitional phase, RTR has decided to embark
on an ambitious plan to launch the country's first digital satellite-
delivered tv package. A joint venture with an undisclosed UK company -
Network, it will, according to deputy chairman and director of this
March or April. Beaming from a transponder on Intelsat 604, the
channels will reach a potential audience of 40 million "collective
customers" served by cable systems throughout the former Soviet Union.
The start up costs for equipment alone are likely to be between $10-15
be added to the package in the near future.

Bunevich feels the service will introduce viewers to the idea of paying
for their programming and alleviate RTR's financial problems. Although
the broadcaster currently earns around 15% of its income from
advertising, the remainder is obtained from the government, and up to
75% of its total revenue is paid directly to the ministry of
telecommunications for the use of its transmission facilities. While
RTR is likely to remain a state holding company, it will in the future
probably undertake all of its entrepreneurial activities through a
group of daughter companies.

The most successful of the privately-owned broadcasting ventures has
been the NTV television company. Backed by three major Moscow banks
(Most-bank, Stolichny and Natsionalny Kredit), it was given official
approval by President Boris Yeltsin in October 1993, became fully self-
supporting in mid-1995 and currently - through having airtime on the
near-national Channel 4 (which it shares with 2x2) and affiliates in
seven locations including St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Rostov-on-
Don - reaches an estimated 102 million viewers in 168 towns and cities
in Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus.

NTV has built up a reputation for strong and independent news
reporting, with two of its three daily newscasts (Segodnya at 7pm and
10pm) regularly achieving a 34% audience share and the midnight news
(Segodnya v polnoch) peaking at 45%. Itogi, a weekly news and current
affairs program, also scores consistently high ratings.

The station in addition allocates 53% of its airtime to high-quality
films and each week carries eight foreign and three Russian movies,
along with six hours of serial telefilms. According to Andrei
Golovanov, its head of international relations and acquisitions, it has
agreements with over 30 distributors including Warner Bros, MCA, MGM
and 20th Century Fox and has been the first channel in the country to
air such movies as Jaws, The Deer Hunter and Silence of the Lambs.

Although NTV currently acquires almost all of its programming, it has
started to co-produce a 30 x half-hour series of documentaries named
Criminal Russia with a U.S. company and is "also considering some other
offers." In Golovanov's view, its success has been built on independent
news, a good selection of movies and working efficiently "without too
much bureaucracy." For this to continue, however, it may have to
increase its Russian output as "people are becoming tired of western
programs."

It is at a regional and local level, however, that the greatest
activity in Russian broadcasting is currently taking place. There are
currently several dozen stations (out of some 3,000 non-governmental
independent services around the country) operating on this basis which
started out three to four years ago as little more than pirates but
have since matured into highly professional organisations. Their
numbers include Skat TV (in Samara), Tomsk TV (Tomsk) and Afontovo,
which operates two TV channels and a radio station in the far eastern
city of Krasnoyarsk.

Several of these broadcasters have teamed up to create associations,
which have in turn developed into loose horizontal networks. One of
these (the 126-member Nezavisimaya Veschatelnaya Sistema - NVS) started
off in mid-1994 exchanging 26 minutes a week of programming including
news, tv movies, series and soaps and has since increased this to four
hours daily. Run on a co-operative basis, it has a potential audience
of 80 million and is seen by many as a potential rival to NTV.

The driving force behind such projects is Internews, an international
non-profit organization founded in the U.S. in 1981 which supports
independent television in newly-emerging democracies. Its activities in
the former Soviet Union, which date back to U.S.-Soviet "space bridges"
in the 1980s which brought people together face-to-face by satellite,
now include the Russian-American Media Partnerships Program (RAMP) and
Open Skies.

According to Grigory Libergal, Internews' programming director, Open
Skies was launched in January 1995 with aid from the Soros Foundation
and provides one hour of documentaries a day free of charge to all
stations willing to take part on condition that they respect copyright.
Some of the programming is produced by Internews itself and the number
of stations participating in the scheme throughout the former Soviet
Union has grown from 45 to over 180. During 1996 the service will be
restructured to offer more specials, series and retrospectives, with
airtime at weekends being increased to two 90-minute slots.

Internews has also operated a news exchange scheme called Local Time
since 1993. While at first also involving broadcasters in the Ukraine,
Belarus and Central Asia who have since gone on to run their own
versions, this is now a wholly Russian service which brings together
some 60 independent stations from around the country. Most file news
reports to Internews' head office in Moscow which are then compiled
into a weekly 30-minute show including some foreign items and sent back
to the stations for rebroadcasting.

While some observers may be surprised at the popularity of news
programming in Russia, Bruce Macdonald, the chairman of Moscow-based ad
agency BBDO Marketing, feels the country is "in the middle of a
pendulum swing" and that news will "always be popular and remain so in
a society that moves this fast." In his view, although it has gone
through its "romance" with soaps (Baywatch and Dynasty have both been
hugely successful and Dallas is expected to arrive shortly), the
Russian audience is still enjoying such programs as audience
participation shows purely for their novelty value and at the same time
"yearning for something that is Russian-produced."

Macdonald feels that one of the keys to the future of broadcasting in
Russia is the country's newly-emerging middle class, which although
still small is growing rapidly. The microwave service Kosmos TV, which
offers some 16 foreign satellite channels to 1,500 individual and
institutional subscribers in the capital, was initially aimed at
expatriates but has recently begun to introduce more local programming
including a film channel in recognition of these "new Russians."

Macdonald sees the launch of more national or near-national channels as
a distinct possibility and expects Murdoch to eventually establish a
presence in Russia - which could happen sooner rather than later if
BSkyB links up with the RTR Network. He also predicts tv ad spend -
which in 1995 BBDO estimates will total $486-594 million - should rise
by between 25-40% per year compared to the levels of 4-5% more common
in western Europe.

However, there are some worrying trends in an industry that was rocked
to the core by the murder of Vladislav Listyev, the general manager of
Ostankino, a year ago. Whereas in 1994 Russian advertisers accounted
for 55% of the total, the figure fell to 30% in 1995 as restrictions on
tobacco and alcohol advertising began to bite and two types of
commercials - financial categories and pyramid schemes - completely
disappeared. "The problems lie in the belief and understanding in
advertising and investment marketing per se," Macdonald said. "While
Russia is a very production-oriented country, consumers have until now
not been a consequence in a market which offered little if any choice."

The Russian advertising industry is currently dominated by two groups
which wholesale ad airtime (Premier SV and Video International) and
several smaller ones including Maxima, InterVID and Ekran-TV who have
to go through them in order to serve broadcasters. While Video
International handles RTR, NTV and 2x2 exclusively, Premier SV jointly
takes care of the accounts of ORT, Channel 5, TV6 (a Moscow station
once part-owned by Turner Broadcasting) and MTK with other wholesalers.

Dina Kalugina, the media director of Young & Rubicam Europe, is upbeat
about the future of television advertising in the country. In her
opinion 1994 was a significant year for the industry as media inflation
stood at an unacceptably high level of 5-7% a month. This has since
stabilized and after the upcoming summer's presidential elections the
market is likely to be boosted by new advertisers. It will also be
helped by a new advertising law which was adopted in July 1995 and
specifies, among other things, the percentage of broadcast time allowed
for commercials.

Kalugina added that current primetime rates range from $12-30,000 and
$19-30,000 per minute on ORT and RTR respectively, while those on such
local channels as 2x2 ($2,500 plus) and TV6 (up to $5,600) are
considerably cheaper. NTV is an exception, however, for although its
rates start as low as $8,000 they shoot up to $28,000 for its weekly
news program.

Kalugina also identifies a problem with programs or advertising blocks
which are pre-empted and replaced either officially or illegally by
local stations' programming. There is lack of information specifying
when these cutoff points occur and advertising blocks placed in between
programs appear to be most at risk.

Furthermore, she believes present programming trends will continue,
with news still drawing large audiences and soaps such as Santa Barbara
(RTR) and Marie Yelena Cassandra (2x2) being popular for a long time.
Sport, on the other hand, will continue to decline in popularity with
Russian viewers.

NEW NET IS WIRED TO THE MAX (AND MACS)

Bang up-to-date technology and its parent group's array of content
could give CNNfn a head start up the I-way...

Once upon a time, about two years ago, broadcasting meant merely
sending program information to those archaic television and radio
devices.

That's not enough anymore. Today a new network ain't a network unless
it's on the network, the Internet. It probably has to be on multiple
computer networks.

At least that's how you might feel after you read about CNN's new
financial network, CNNfn. In what will probably be a model for
broadcast networks of the future, not only will CNNfn be available via
the Galaxy 1R C-Band satellite, DirecTV, Prime Star, Netlink,
Superstar, Time-Warner and others, it will be wired to the max.

Not content with a mere broadcast presence, CNN is bringing out
"distinct but complementary content" on a number of digital networks as
well as the traditional cable and satellite venues. From launch on
December 29, CNNfn has had its own website on the Internet.
Additionally, the CNN and CNNfn website will be accessible from AT&T's
new online service, the AT&T Business Network. Last but not least,
CNNfn will be part of the CNN at Work service developed by CNN and
Intel.

CNNfn is promising initial programming daily from 7 am to 7 pm ET. Its
program offerings will include coverage of the financial markets,
technology and business, personal finance, Washington's impact on
finance, profiles of corporate managers and even tips on handling
stress. Interaction with the online audience (questions and answers
from the web site) call-ins and live remotes will be a big part of
CNNfn's overall modus operandi.

CNNfn has established "inter.face," a computer networked solution that
will allow CNNfn to set up "mini studios" in the offices of financial
managers and advisors, economists, consultants and other players in the
financial world around the country. These camera, monitor and Compaq
computer based teleconferencing set-ups use a proprietary modification
of Intel's Pro-share product to link sites around the country with
CNNfn's New York studio.

Inter.face studios in the offices of companies like Goldman-Sachs,
Merrill Lynch, Ernst and Young and Lehman Brothers will allow CNNfn to
respond immediately to changes in the market and get perspectives from
experts who can be interviewed on the job.

This saves them the trip to a studio for the interview and gets CNNfn
the interview faster than if they had to send out a remote truck. The
teleconferencing data, transferred over MFS Datanet's ATM network, will
be converted and broadcast out of the CNNfn studio.

The CNNfn website, CNNfn.com, will be grabbing content from CNNfn's
broadcast, plus creating additional content for the site, right in the
newsroom. The website will provide multimedia coverage of business
news, follow the U.S. and international markets, provide personal and
corporate financial management tips, disseminate market tips and gossip
and solicit comments and questions from surfers to use on air. Archives
available via the website will include programming information,
transcripts and air schedules of CNNfn and CNN programs, corporate
profiles, a business glossary, stories from Lexis-Nexis and, of course,
links to other sites.

Members of the AT&T Business Network, a dial-up online service, will
have a seamless link to the CNNfn web site. They'll also have exclusive
chat and message boards related to topics and stories on CNNfn.

CNN at Work is CNN's video and print news service for corporations. It
sends Headline News, CNN and CNNfn video over corporate LANs to desktop
PCs in the workplace. It features topic filtering, so you can have the
system look for subjects like "oil." CNN at Work will then grab related
stories from Time, Fortune, Lexis-Nexis and Knight Ridder Financial
News for you. It will alert you whenever stories about oil come up on
the three CNN services and then let you display the video in real-time
or tape it for later viewing.

For now, CNNfn's efforts will be focused on and deployed in the U.S.
There are hopes, but not a definite time table, for expansion to
elsewhere in the world.

All this action puts CNN at the forefront, not only in breadth of
technology, but in the re-purposing of content. Freelance writers have
always tried to resell the same story in different form to multiple
publishers just to survive. For years visionaries on the leading edge
of interactive television have pointed to news coverage as a prime
market. These information technologists have always seen the four hours
of background and additional data that didn't make the two-minute aired
piece as a goldmine. With interactive tv, they said, this additional
footage could be viewed by viewers who "wanted to know more" about any
given story. Obviously, CNN's websites and wired ventures will allow it
to take advantage of this gold mine, in addition to opening up new ways
to create exciting, original online content.

And that's not all. Remember, CNN has an interactive media division as
well. I wouldn't be surprised to see a whole shelf of CNNfn CD-Roms in
my local computer store in the next year or so.

CABLE OPERATORS PLUG IN TO ANALOG SET-TOPS

Though high-speed PC services have displaced video-on-demand as the
cable industry's hot new revenue stream, operators have not given up on
analog tv as a near-term platform for advanced, interactive services.
Jean-Luc Renaud and Mitch Shapiro review an analysis from hardware
manufacturer Scientific-Atlanta.

Anaheim's Western Cable Show made it clear that cable operators and
settop decoder suppliers have begun seriously to explore a strategy
that would use a new generation of "advanced" analog set-top boxes to
deliver limited interactive tv capabilities using on-screen text and
graphics transmitted via the vertical blanking interval (VBI).

These relatively low-cost devices will allow operators to create
"virtual channels" that require neither extra bandwidth nor an
investment in digital video compression.

Among the services that can be supported by advanced analog set-top
boxes are interactive viewing guides (IVGs), enhanced pay-per view
(EPPV) services, interactive advertising, subscriber messaging and text
and graphics-based information channels.

As cable operators have come to realise that near-term revenue streams
cannot justify the cost of digital set-top boxes and the other
components of a VOD system (such as broadband switching, servers and
modulators), many have pushed back their timetables for deployment of
digital set-top equipment.

As this occurs, advanced analog set-tops are emerging as a near-term
alternative to their digital counterparts. Whereas the latter are
expected initially to cost $375-$600, depending upon their
functionality, the former are priced just $25-$60 above the standard
analog converters which cable operators now purchase for $110-$130 per
unit.

According to a paper issued by Scientific Atlanta (S-A), one of the
leading suppliers of cable tv set-tops, "the installed base of advanced
analog set-top boxes in 1995 (in the U.S.) may exceed one million
units, while digital set-tops will be less than 50,000."

The paper, entitled Advanced Analog Systems: Providing Revenue-
Generating Applications for Today's Network Systems, was commissioned
to Probe Research's Gary Kim, described as a long-time observer of the
broadband industry.

In its paper, S-A provided some estimates of the new incremental
revenue streams that might be generated by interactive services running
on advanced analog set-top platforms.

The analysis begins with a pay-per-view business model (Table 1) which
considers three scenarios: low (12,000 subscribers), baseline (15,000)
and high (18,000). Annual operator revenues from PPV (for the average
system) can range from $27,000 to more than $133,000. But operators can
make more money through making PPV "more innovative."

The S-A analysis considered low, baseline and high estimates for an
interactive guide business and for two versions of a "virtual channel"
information service: the first funded by advertisers, the second funded
by subscriber fees.

The types of content that might be delivered via virtual channel
information services, the paper suggests, include news summaries,
weather, traffic, sports, financial information, local event listings,
restaurant menus/delivery, lottery results, health tips and community
events.

Scientific-Atlanta's analysis considers three combinations of IVG
penetration and pricing (Table 2). The "low" revenue model assumes 30%
penetration and a monthly subscriber fee of $0.50. The figures for the
"base case" and "high" estimates are 50%/$1.00 and 80%/$1.95,
respectively.

For all three scenarios, it is assumed that a cable operator would keep
90% of IVG fees, passing on 10% to the provider of program schedule
data. Based on these assumptions, per-subscriber annual revenues in the
three scenarios are: $1.62 (low), $5.40 (base) and $16.85 (high).

The advertiser-funded virtual-channel model (Table 3) is considered
next. In this model, the advertiser provides content and sponsorship.
The network operator's advertising sales department sells the virtual
channel, just as it sells "local avails" now. "From the advertiser's
perspective, this is a strong vehicle for target marketing, is less
expensive to deliver than traditional advertising and marks the
advertiser as an early adopter of technology," argues the S-A paper.

The model considers three monthly prices an advertiser might pay for
each sponsored virtual channel: $500, $1,200 and $1,900. Annual per-
subscriber revenues generated by a single virtual channel under these
three assumptions are: $0.50 (low), $0.96 (base) and $1.27 (high).

Estimated annual operator revenues for advertiser-funded virtual
channels can range from $5,000 to more than $22,000 per channel. Using
rates from various cable advertising sources, estimated rate structures
could range from $500 to $1,900 a month per channel.

Scientific-Atlanta's model for subscription-based virtual information
channels (Table 4) assumes subscribers are charged a monthly fee for a
package of channels and that operators pass on 10% of these fees to
content providers.

The model considers three combinations of monthly pricing and
penetration: $1.00/30% (low), $2.00/42% (base) and $3.00/60% (high).
The annual per-subscriber revenues for these three scenarios are $3.24,
$9.07 and $19.44, respectively.

Based on S-A's analysis, a cable operator using advanced analog set-top
boxes to deliver an IVG and a package of subscription-based virtual
channels, might generate incremental annual revenues ranging from $4.86
to $55.73 per subscriber.

This does not include any additional PPV or subscription-service
revenues that might be generated by IVG and virtual channel promotional
material.

It also does not include potential revenues from direct-response
advertising in which subscribers use their remote control to request
follow-up mailings containing information about a product featured in a
tv ad. Experience with 800-number direct response ads suggests
advertisers are willing to pay significant amounts for access to such
self-selected prospects.

Estimated annual operator revenues for subscriber-based virtual
channels can range from $38,000 to more than $349,000 per package of
channels.

The S-A paper also offers the hybrid model - supported by subscribers
and sponsored by advertising. The subscriber pays an o-la-carte fee for
customized information; the advertiser charges lower advertising rates -
 possibly half the rate for completely advertiser-funded channels.
Benefits of this hybrid model include reduction of sponsorship costs
for the advertiser, allowing smaller advertisers to participate; the
ability for an advertiser to reach a specific target market, for
example, subscribers who pay for sports information; the provision to
subscribers of customized information at a reasonable price; and the
advantage for network operators to relay on two revenue streams
(advertiser and subscriber).

Virtual channels create a new market for content providers who develop
applications for virtual channels and software vendors who provide
authoring tools that facilitate building and testing applications.

So, given their potential revenues and modest incremental costs, it is
not surprising that advanced analog set-top decoders are gaining
increased attention from cable operators that face capital constraints
yet are eager to explore the brave new world of interactive tv.

MORE TV NEWS, OR MORE OF THE SAME?

ABC is launching a 24-hour news channel in the U.S. to capitalize on
its brand name, worldwide reporting resources and 200-plus broadcast
affiliates. NBC and Microsoft are launching a 24-hour news network for,
well, the same reasons, with the added boast they will take advantage
of emerging online distribution technologies.

Rupert Murdoch may launch a 24-hour news channel, he too for the
reasons cited by ABC and NBC, and  because CNN is too left-wing. "We
think it's time for a truly objective news channel," the mighty mogul
said during a speaking engagement.

While the ABC, Microsoft-NBC and Murdoch networks are six months to a
year or longer in the offing, just days ago CNN launched its third news
channel, CNN Financial News (CNNfn). And NBC is already on the air with
two info-oriented channels, CNBC and America's Talking. (NBC will, in
fact, drop America's Talking in favor of the new news network, MSNBC
Cable, thereby plugging it into 20 million homes the day it launches.)

If the rest of the mystic distribution puzzle can be solved, Americans
will be flooded with news. Unfortunately, they'll drown before they're
ever informed.

ABC executives talk about offering their network's top-rated programs -
shows like World News Tonight, Nightline and Good Morning America -
along with live coverage of major breaking news stories. In other
words, they'll chop up what they already produce, repackage it and then
add that greatest of all-news-network fillers, pictures of any old
event you can point a camera at.

It will be CNN with the one thing CNN doesn't have, big-name news shows
fronted by big-name news stars. NBC will do the same, though further
chopping up pictures and sound and graphics into finer bits and bytes
so all that content  can be downloaded from Microsoft's online service-
cum-web-site-cum-cyber-offering. Ditto Murdoch, though presumably his
will have to add in that special something that makes live shots of
press conferences, trials and Congressional hearings less left-wing.

These 24-hour wheels of news will spin and spin. Sparks will fly.
Images will leap from our televisions.

No doubt one of these networks will be on hand with a portable uplink
the day war breaks out somewhere. It will be the live shot of the
century.

No doubt all of them will switch on the next time a criminal-turned-
celebrity or celebrity-turned-criminal hears his verdict from the jury.
It will be a defining moment in our lives.

We and these networks will jump from live shot to defining moment to
live shot. Television news will finally give up any pretense that it
should, even every once in a while, explain what its cameras see or
examine what its microphones hear.

And let me be clear: explaining, examining, you don't do this by asking
your reporter on the scene for twenty seconds of what she thinks, or
even sitting five or six of them down in a studio to hash things over.
In the U.S., since the verdict in the O.J. Simpson trial, not one of
the networks has attempted anything like a definitive documentary on
the problem of race in this country - only the issue that looms largest
in America at the end of this, the American century. I'd expect such a
documentary to use all the story-telling technique and production
pizzazz I'm always told tv news can bring to bear on a story. Why was
the independent low-budget film Hoop Dreams a better examination of
race than anything any network attempted during or after the Simpson
trial?

When American troops are involved in skirmishing in Bosnia, no doubt
camera lenses will spring out of the brush faster than gun barrels. Has
any network even tried to explain how the former Yugoslavia got to be
the way it is, and, then, American soldiers got to be there? This is a
conflict where - at least until U.S. military involvement began -  the
U.S. public didn't care what was going on. So the network news
divisions didn't try too hard to explain it.

All of us, commentators and news executives alike, have for years
accepted the conventional wisdom that the U.S. networks had to give up
on serious documentary work. Prime-time just became too competitive to
waste it on old-time habits like examining and explaining. Today, when
the networks put current affairs in prime, the vehicle is the news
magazine, a salacious mix of consumer scare stories, celebrity (and
royalty) interviews and "investigative journalism" in which the good
guys and bad guys are clearly identified, and nothing much is learned
about a system or plan or idea.

But the broadcasting universe is changing. ABC and Microsoft-NBC, for a
start, are setting up new news networks, with all that round-the-clock
time to fill. Will we get what we gave up, or will it just be more - in
this case oceans more - of the same?

JAN. 18 FCC MEETING DOUBTFUL BECAUSE OF GOVT. SHUTDOWN

     Scheduled FCC agenda meeting Jan. 18 was very much in doubt
because of extended govt. shutdown over budget fight between
Administration and congressional Republicans.  It's Commission
policy that staff items to be considered at open meetings be sent
to commissioners by bureaus and offices involved 21 days before
meeting (TVD Oct 23 p5), although that deadline can be waived by
commissioners.  Jan. 18 date hasn't been canceled formally, but FCC
sources told us it surely will be.  Other Commission matters also
will be delayed when govt. returns to work, they said, because no
one has been around to work on issues, digest comments, etc.

     Agency had scheduled Jan. 30 en banc session on spectrum
issues, to be chaired by Comr. Ness because of her special interest
in spectrum matters.  At that meeting, new ways to allocate
spectrum were to be discussed by invited witnesses.  Commission is
required by law to meet at least once each month and there's now
talk that Jan. 30 session will be considered as meeting for month. 
However, since agency legally can't put out notices or news
releases during budget-mandated shutdown, any decisions must await
its formal return to work, according to sources.

     Among hardest hit by shutdown have been outside govt.
contractors, such as maintenance, security, vending, transcription
services.  Martin Clark, pres. of ITS Inc. document service, said
he's losing $20,000 daily and has laid off all but 10 of his work
force of 45.  A few are on board because auctions generated small
amount of business, he said.  Clark said he kept his employees on
payroll during week-long shutdown in Nov. but couldn't afford it
2nd time.  He said he doesn't expect to recoup losses because
experience has shown average daily revenues of $20,000 "don't
change" after snow days and other shutdowns.  ITS paid employees
for Christmas Day because "I just had to," Clark said.  "I'm angry,
very angry about this.  Millions of people across the United States
that do work for the government are hurt by this shutdown."

     Although most FCC employees were sent home because of lack of
funds, some were permitted to continue working on such things as
auctions, court arguments and international matters (TVD Dec 25
p4).  FCC's Block C PCS auction began Dec. 18, first day of
shutdown, and ran through Dec. 21, when it took holiday recess. 
Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued week of Dec.
18.  SMR auction resumes Jan. 2, Block C auction Jan. 5.  Some
auction staffers continued to work last week.  Call to Auction Div.
Dec. 29. revealed "7 or 8" employees were on board, along with
Wireless Bureau Chief Michele Farquhar and Assoc. Bureau Chief
Rosalind Allen in front office.

     We're told couple of staffers from Office of Legislative &
Intergovernmental Affairs were in briefly Dec. 28, weren't back
next day.  Gen. Counsel's office was staffed week of Dec. 18
because 2 court arguments were held that week.  Common Carrier
Bureau now is nearly empty, with only one employee classified as
essential to oversee network reliability;  same is case with Mass
Media Bureau.  "I am literally the only person on this floor," said
employee on 8th floor Dec. 29.

     Some commissioners have been seen entering and leaving
building from time to time during 2-week shutdown, not staying
long, but according to law their personal staffs aren't permitted
to work.  However, during Nov. shutdown, commissioners' staffers
continued to work by telephone, mostly from their homes, and in at
least one case met in Va. home of Jane Mago, senior legal adviser
to Comr. Chong, on children's issue in approval of Westinghouse
takeover of CBS (TVD Nov 27 p3).

     Likely to be delayed by shutdown is approval of Disney Co.'s
$19-billion purchase of Cap/ABC, which had been expected to be on
agenda for Jan. 18 meeting.  Numerous deadlines for filing comments
have passed while Commission has been closed, and in addition to
comments, FCC will be hit with avalanche of petitions, complaints
and applications once it reopens.  One lawyer said stacks of
petitions cover table in his firm's conference room, all waiting to
be filed.  "I can't imagine the long lines that will form" at FCC
filing rooms once shutdown is over, PCIA Regulatory Dir. Robert
Hoggarth said.

     Meanwhile, President Clinton resumed meetings with Senate
Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)
Dec. 29 in effort to resolve budget issues.  Meetings were expected
to continue through New Year's weekend.

HILL SAYS BROADCASTERS WON'T GET 'GIVEAWAY'

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on
budget and telecom bills said Dec. 29 that staff-level negotiations
have rejected White House proposal for broadcasters' early return
of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum.  Sources said
no deal has been reached on spectrum issues as high-level talks
continued at White House.  They also said that there would be "no
giveaways" to broadcasters as part of final budget deal.  Statement
contradicted assertion by Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.), who
was reported by Reuters Dec. 28 as objecting to what he called
"giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Dole also said there were
problems with telecom bill, but he wouldn't elaborate.

     Sources said some published estimates of value of analog
spectrum to be given back after conversion of broadcasting services
to digital technology have been wildly exaggerated.  While some
reports have put value as high as $70 billion, sources said figure
is more in neighborhood of $6 billion.  That amount, they said,
wouldn't include costs to society of having industry and consumers
convert to new technologies before either is ready.  Negotiators
also rejected White House proposal for $1-billion subsidy to
consumers to help them adjust to conversion through purchase of
set-top boxes.  Forcing consumers and industry in short term to use
technology that market hasn't found to be ready could short-circuit
development of advanced TV (ATV) services, Hill sources said,
adding that FCC has wide discretion to determine whether ATV
licenses should be awarded and what conditions should be attached,
including disposition of analog spectrum.

     Dole's assertion that there were "3, 4 or 5 provisions" in
bill that needed fixing also raised intriguing situation of having
him contradict rest of Senate leadership, including Commerce
Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) and senior committee Democrat
Hollings (D-S.C.), who said deal was in final form.  House
Republicans haven't accepted that, and still were working to make
changes, principally in sections that had been removed from bill
and that they wanted restored.

     For example, House sources said that Senate wanted removal of
provision that would preclude FCC from regulating Internet,
provision that was in House version but not in Senate's.  House
measure, sponsored by Reps. Cox (R-Cal.), Wyden (D-Ore.) and White
(R-Wash.), passed by 420-4 as part of wider piece of bill also
aimed at combating cyberporn.  Republican sources said debate on
regulation provision revolved around argument that there's no
telling what services Internet would carry in future, whether it be
common carrier, mass media or video now regulated by separate
titles of Communications Act.  It didn't make sense to "preempt
regulation in perpetuity," sources said.  Sponsors were working to
have clauses restored. 

     ACLU sent letter Dec. 22 to members of conference committee on
telecom bill urging vote against another part of Cox/Wyden/White
proposal, dealing with cyberporn on Internet.  ACLU urged rejection
of plan because it "will immediately damage freedom of expression,
the bedrock value at the core of the First Amendment and will
structure the telecommunications industry so that free speech and
privacy are in permanent jeopardy."  Laura Murphy, dir. of ACLU
Washington office, and Donald Haines, legislative counsel, listed
3 objections to bill:  (1) It would "establish a big government
censorship regime" for Internet and on-line communications by
providing criminal penalties for what adult users can see on their
own computers and by regulating protected speech.  (2) It would set
up similar "big government censorship" for TV programs.  ACLU said
V-chip would "vest the government, not parents," with control over
TV set through ratings system "driven by government guidelines on
content."  (3) It would "foster communications monopolies that
stifle diversity and free speech."

     Rep. Oxley (R-O.) would like language revived that would lift
restrictions on foreign ownership of common carrier licenses. 
Sources said there was no agreement between House and Senate on
measure, so it was dropped because Senate language that would allow
FCC to revoke licenses of foreign owners of U.S. businesses was
"worse than nothing."  Conferees will begin to receive conference
report this week after returning from break.  But some senators not
only received it, but signed it, before leaving for Christmas.  It
will be up to parliamentary experts to determine status of
conference report if lawmakers have signed, believing it to be
final version, while others say it's still open for discussion. 
House sources said bill isn't final until majority of conferees
have voted for it, but at same time they don't expect major
changes.

     House sources said that bill "substantially reflects the work
of the House" in conference, noting particularly requirement for
facilities-based competition pushed by Commerce Committee Chmn.
Bliley (R-Va.) and checklist concept of Telecom Subcommittee Chmn.
Fields (R-Tex.).  Other parts, however, were "watered down by the
Senate," sources said, although Bliley believed that final product
should be supported.  Sources said House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)
hasn't directed that specific changes be made, although meetings
this week may cover those subjects.  Gingrich and Majority Leader
Armey (R-Tex.) have said that problems with bill need to be
resolved.

MUST-CARRY APPEAL OPPOSED

     U.S. Supreme Court shouldn't set expedited schedule for
must-carry appeal because main legal arguments already have been
decided, leaving only voluminous factual record to consider,
Justice Dept. and broadcasters said in opposition to cable bid for
quick action (TVD Dec 25 p4).  Govt. brief, signed by Solicitor
Gen. Drew Days, also said expedited schedule would be hardship for
govt. because of federal shutdown and holidays.  Cable interests
had hoped for quick decision on expedited treatment, but hadn't
been notified by Court by our deadline.

     Court "would not be well served by rushed proceedings in this
case," Justice Dept. said, because, contrary to cable claims,
"principal doctrinal issues in the case" were settled by Supreme
Court in earlier decision (TVD July 4/94 p2).  Now, govt. said,
Court must evaluate tens of thousands of pages of evidence
submitted to lower court to determine whether Congress had enough
evidence to back its decision to impose must-carry.

     Court could decide quickly to uphold must-carry, NAB, INTV,
APTS, PBS and CPB said in joint brief.  However, they said it took
5 months for lower court to consider evidence and uphold
congressional action:  "Obviously, even greater care would be
required before this Court could reverse that judgment and strike
down a presumptively constitutional statute... No matter how much
this appeal was expedited, it would not be possible for this Court
to decide the case in [cable's] favor this term."

     But cable interests don't seek shortened briefing schedule,
just quick decision to take case that would allow it to be heard
this term, cable groups said in reply brief.  NCTA and programmers
repeated that they're willing to shorten their own briefing time if
necessary to get decision this term.  Size of record doesn't make
quick decision impossible, they said, because dispute isn't over
facts, only over legal significance of facts.  Brief also said
majority opinion upholding must-carry wasn't majority at all
because one judge backed full hearing on merits.

     Other arguments in broadcast and govt. briefs include:  (1)
Justice said many federal legal, paralegal and clerical staff
employees were on furlough, making it difficult to comply with
expedited schedule.  (2) Broadcasters said record shows that
must-carry impact on cable has been de minimis, since growth in
channel capacity every 26 days equals total impact of must-carry on
channel capacity.  (3) Broadcasters said cable programmers have
more, not less, carriage and subscribership since must-carry was
imposed, so impact is minimal.  (4) Broadcasters, countering cable
argument that quick decision is needed because next date for
selecting between must-carry and retransmission consent is Oct.,
said any burden of that deadline is on broadcasters who are willing
to accept it.  (5) Broadcasters said coming FCC decision on
must-carry for advanced TV doesn't require quick decision because
no advanced TV will be in service before Court's next term.

CONGRESS TIGHTENS RULES ON GIFTS

     Effective New Year's Day, new ethics rules covering House
members and staffers prohibit them from accepting "any gift" unless
it falls "into one of the specific exemptions."  Cited as of
"nominal value" and acceptable are "baseball cap or a T-shirt,"
while flowers for office "every week" from same lobbyist aren't
acceptable.  New Senate gift rules also are effective Jan. 1, but
they aren't as restrictive as those for House.

     For instance, on Senate side gifts worth no more than $49.99
may be accepted, with gifts valued at no more than $100 (below $10
doesn't count) okay from any one source over 12-month period. 
Current Senate limit is $250 per year for gifts from one source. 
On House side, any gifts of value will be banned except from family
member or close personal friend of long standing.  House rules
don't define "nominal value," but do list several items under that
category that wouldn't be acceptable, along with those that would.

     In explaining new policy (House Rule 52), House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct uses such terms as "Larry Lobbyist"
and "Moe Member," "Lucy Lobbyist" and "Carl Congressman," "Joe
College" and "Roy Representative," "Connie Constituent" and "Myrna
Member."  Among "biggest changes," said memo explaining new rules,
is elimination of local meal exception.  That means member or
staffer no longer will be able to accept meal at someone else's
expense, while senators and their staffers may continue to do so. 
Also prohibited by House are gifts to relatives or close associates
of members.

     However, meals for House members still are acceptable during
travel or speaking engagements "in connection with official
duties."  It said members and staff "may still accept food and
refreshments of nominal value... e.g., coffee and donuts, hors
d'oeuvres [liquor isn't mentioned] at a reception" and "free
attendance at a widely attended event."

     Tickets to sports events, plays and musicals also are
forbidden under new House rules.  As example, "Stanley Staffer" no
longer may accept tickets to hockey game offered by "Laura
Lobbyist."  If "Chloe Congresswoman" goes to widely attended event,
she may not accept "entertainment collateral to the event," such as
theatre tickets or food "not provided in a group setting." 
However, gifts up to $250 in value from long-time friends still may
be accepted, while gifts of more than $250 must be approved by
Committee.

     Attendance at charity events (including with spouse) still
will be exempt under new rules, but gifts of travel and lodging in
connection with such events won't.  For instance, "Ron
Representative" and his wife may accept tickets offered by
"National Assn. of Do-Gooders" for its annual fund-raising dinner
but they may not accept tickets from "MegaCorporation" that
purchased table for same dinner.  Do-Gooders also host celebrity
golf tournament in Palm Springs and if Ron Representative wants to
participate he must pay his own transportation and lodging but may
accept meals and waiver of entrance fee.

     New rule continues to allow payment of travel by House members
and staffers to NAB conventions, for example, because "funding of
this kind of activity is deemed reimbursement to the House and not
a gift to the individual traveler."  Such free travel is limited to
4 days in contiguous 48 states, 7 days (excluding travel days)
elsewhere.  All privately funded travel expenses must be itemized
and made public within 30 days.

     On Senate side, gifts are defined as "any item having monetary
value."  Annual gift restriction of $100 ($250 from personal
friends) doesn't apply to home-state products for promotional
purposes, personal hospitality (except from lobbyists and foreign
agents), political contributions, training "in the interests of the
Senate," charitable fund-raisers "as long as activities are not
substantially recreational."  Unlike House, senators and staffers
may accept travel and lodging for such events.  Senate rules also
contain section on "special prohibitions for lobbyists and foreign
agents."  Under old Senate rules, only gifts valued at $100 or more
counted toward $250 annual total permitted from single source, and
spouses' and dependents' gifts were counted separately.

     Unrelated to House and Senate ethics rules, on Dec. 19
President Clinton signed into law first major revision of lobbying
restrictions since 1946.  While old law applied only to lobbying of
Congress, new restrictions also affect senior Exec. Branch
officials and cover lobbying by nonprofit groups.  Said President
in signing bill:  "Lobbyists in the back room, secretly writing law
and looking for loopholes, do not have a place in our democracy." 
New law specifies that persons who spend more than 20% of their
work time on lobbying must register.  Generally speaking, broadcast
lobbyists said new law would have little or no impact on them. 
They already file reports 4 times annually (new law requires 2 such
reports per year), listing percent of their salaries that goes
toward lobbying activities.

     CBS News Pres. Eric Ober, in Dec. 28 memo to employees, said
he will give up his title Jan. 12.  New CBS Pres.-CEO Peter Lund
"has decided to make a change," Ober told colleagues.  His
departure had been widely speculated since Westinghouse acquired
control of network (TVD Nov 27 p3).  Andrew Heyward, CBS News vp
and exec. producer of CBS Evening News, is seen as likely
successor.  Ober is 53, has been with CBS in various jobs for 30
years, was pres. of owned TV stations just before being named News
pres. 5 years ago.  He was paid $1.46 million in "vested and
unvested" stock options when Westinghouse acquired network and had
signed new 3-year contract worth more than $3.3 million in 1995.

     Ohio PUC should intervene in interconnection negotiations
between Time Warner (TW) and Ameritech because telco wants to
charge "excessive" rates for "some key services" and hasn't
provided cost justifications, TW said in letter to PUC Chmn. Craig
Glazer.  TW also charged that although it has reached deals on all
technical issues, it "has not been negotiating directly with those
individuals in Ameritech who can finally explain, modify and

     Rep. Tauzin (R-La.) said he won't run for Senate, in part

     Rep. Tauzin (R-La.) said he won't run for Senate, in part
because he expects to play major role on Telecom Subcommittee in
future.  His spokesman, Ken Johnson, said Tauzin "has a handshake
agreement" with Commerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.) on Tauzin's
future role on committee, and his "seniority would be respected." 
Johnson stopped short of saying that Tauzin would be named chmn. of
subcommittee when current Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.) retires at end of
1996.  Spokesman for House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tauzin's
seniority "puts him next in line" for Subcommittee chair, and
Tauzin will be given "full consideration" for job.  Rep. Oxley
(R-O.) is current Subcommittee vice chmn., would like to take over
chairmanship.  Oxley also is chmn. of subcommittee handling
commerce, trade and hazardous waste issues.  Technically, speaker
doesn't appoint subcommittee chmn. -- committee members vote on
recommendations by chairman of full panel.  Tauzin, who switched
from Democratic Party earlier this year, has more seniority than
Oxley, but he also has more seniority than Commerce Committee Chmn.
Bliley (R-Va.) and wasn't given Bliley's job when he changed
parties.  Hill sources said Tauzin has been in Republican
leadership's good graces for years, working with Republicans to
help them go around Democratic leadership.

ADVANCED FIBER TECHNOLOGIES BRING RAY OF HOPE TO BELEAGUERED
CABLE INDUSTRY

     While the threat of regulatory intervention set an ominous
tone for the Western Cable Show held December 13-15 in Anaheim,
CA, advances in the use of fiber technology to improve the
picture quality, reliability and channel capacity of cable TV
systems dominated the exhibit floor.  "Fiber trunking is just
beginning," said Jim Chiddix, senior vice president of
engineering and technology at cable multiple system operator ATC.
"There were only a few systems installed in 1988, a couple
hundred in 1989, and we're expecting a thousand or so in 1990,"
he said.
     Cable operators are hoping that better picture quality and
greater system reliability will translate into happier customers-
-and take the heat of pending reregulation off the cable
industry.  "More than half of cable subscribers cite picture
quality and reliability--and, more importantly quick response to
difficulties that arise--as problems facing the cable industry,"
says Nick Hamilton Piercy, vice president of engineering and
technical services for Rogers Cable TV in Canada.  With that in
mind, Piercy says Rogers' experimental system in Toronto features
a fiber backbone ring structure that can send signals in both
directions if service is interrupted.  "There's self-healing if
there is a cut," he says.  In addition, the installation of a
secondary ring reduces the number of subscribers served per hub.
It also cuts the amount of coaxial cable (and therefore the
number of amplifiers or power boosters) between the headend and
homes.

CABLE'S FIBER CHALLENGE: ADAPTING OPTICAL DEVICES TO CATV ANALOG
NEEDS

     Reducing the number of devices between the signal source and
subscribers is essential to improve signal power and reduce
picture noise and distortion.  But off-the-shelf laser devices
(built for digital transmission) need to be adapted to the analog
requirements of cable television, says ATC's Chiddix.  Most
optical components developed for digital modulation in
telecommunications were designed for simply turning on and off
high-speed signals, and therefore encounter difficulties when
used to transmit compressed video information in analog form.
     Nonetheless, advances in distributive feedback (DFB) lasers
are resulting in higher power from cable headends with lower
noise and distortion, reports Dave Robinson, director of Jerrold
Division's Cableoptics.  Robinson notes that the first high-
performance lasers built with cable applications in mind
(manufactured by Ortel Corp.) resulted in a 3-5 dB carrier to
noise improvement in Jerrold's second-generation AM Fiber Optics
Backbone system.
     Jerrold's new system can now deliver 80 channels (an
increase of 35 channels) on two fibers for 10 miles with a 56 dB
carrier to noise ratio.  Field trials will begin in April or May
in Cablevision systems in the Northeast, with volume purchases
expected in July, Jerrold's John Burke tells VTN.
     Robinson says Jerrold will continue to take fiber "to-the-
tap" (the tap is a device installed in cable feeder lines that
provides signals to the subscriber's drop), rather than all the
way into the home--at least for the next 10 years.  "Coaxial drop
has one gigahertz (GHz) capability and there is a large cost
penalty extending beyond the tap directly into the home," he
said.
     On the drawing board are optical amplifiers to replace
current devices.  Howard Westlake, research engineer at British
Telecom Research defines optical amplifiers as "devices that
increase the intensity of an optical signal without translating
the signal between an optical and electrical regime."  Westlake
says advantages of optical amplifiers include their compactness,
low component requirements and wide bandwidth capacity for system
upgrades for HDTV and other enhanced services.

CABLE SYSTEM BANDWIDTH INCREASING, BUT THERE MAY BE POINT OF
DIMINISHING RETURNS
     Despite skepticism, cable operators are adamant that
consumer appetite for more and more channels will continue,
either for greater variety of programming, or for future
bandwidth-intensive services such as HDTV, video-on-demand and
two-way interactive services.  Rogers' Piercy, for example,
forecasts a rise in system channel capacity from the current 35-
40 level to 58 channels by the end of 1990, 77 channels by 1993
and possibly 150 channels by 1998.
     With the addition of channels, cable systems have seen a
corresponding evolution of bandwidth from 200 MHz to the 550 MHz
systems shown in force on the exhibit floor--and the industry is
talking about a further increase to a one GHz platform.  However,
one GHz systems may be 8-9 years away, says Intermedia consultant
Dave Large, and "it may not be as simple to make increased
bandwidth increments" as it was in the past.  For example, while
new fiber backbone systems decrease amplifier cascades (or the
number of amplifiers in a sequence), maintenance costs for
amplifiers are not eliminated and signal leakage is still
unaffected.  Furthermore, optical amplifiers for one GHz fiber AM
backbone systems are "a long time in coming--hopefully available
by 1998," adds Bob Young, director of product marketing at
Jerrold.
     But Large says the most daunting problem may lie in homes.
While cable equipment manufacturers are doing their best to
eliminate set-top converters (see story next page), consumer TV
sets will not be able to tune in the ever-increasing number of
channels unless manufacturers change their TV design.  In
addition, home automation standards (such as the EIA's CEbus)
can't handle one GHz signals.

SOLUTIONS TO CABLE'S CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INTERFACE PROBLEM ONLY
ADDING CONFUSION

     Several solutions have been proposed to solve the cable
industry's consumer electronics interface problem (which for
millions of viewers has resulted in a mass of wires and devices
on top of TV sets and the inability to use remote controls.)  But
close investigation of the alternatives only leads to more
confusion, says Alex Best, senior vice president of engineering
at Cox Cable.  "The optimal conditional access device has not yet
been invented," he said.  But trials by cable equipment
manufacturers continue.
     Alternatives include: 1) cigarette pack-sized Multiport
addressable decoders which connect directly into a Multiport plug
in the back of TVs and VCRs; 2) off-premise equipment on a
telephone pole or tap that serves a number of subscribers; 3) on-
premise equipment placed on the side of a home that serves one
subscriber; and 4) "universal" remotes that can control a variety
of consumer products.
     At best, Multiport decoders are only expected to penetrate
5-15% of the 98.7 million addressable subscribers forecast for
1997, says Claude Baggett, director of systems engineering at
CableLabs.  (That is if the Multiport ever gets off the ground at
all, since TV and VCR manufacturers are reluctant to go to the
expense of putting the plug in their products.)  A market for the
Multiport will only develop if VCR manufacturers get into the
act, says Baggett, since TVs have longer lives and will therefore
take longer to be replaced by consumers.  At the Western Show,
Jerrold was showing its EIA Multiport Unit to gauge market
reaction.
     On and off-premise devices offer numerous advantages over
the Multiport, most notably the ability to connect and disconnect
without service calls and the transmission of "clean"
(unscrambled) signals from the headend, which reduces signal
degradation.
     At the Western show, Scientific-Atlanta introduced its
Addressable Interdiction system, which delivers broadband signals
to as many outlets (TVs or VCRs) as required in four subscriber
homes.  Signals for pay services are scrambled using a "jamming"
technique that can encrypt up to 32 channels.  Testing of the
Addressable Interdiction system is now underway at Warner Cable
Communications' Williamsburg, VA system.  A total of 250 homes
will be passed by late this month, with testing lasting over a
year.  Scientific-Atlanta says the system can also be configured
in an on-premise format.
     The advantage of on-premise over off-premise is that the
costs per subscriber always equals the cost per port.  (With
Scientific-Atlanta's 4-port system, if one home is a non-
subscriber, the port goes unused--though non-subscribers can be
sold pay-per-view programming).  Jerrold is now trialing its
Starport on-premise device in Tele-Communications Inc. systems
and hopes to have a prototype in production later this month.
     Zenith, which is "still looking into on and off-premise
technology," is pushing the "universal" remote concept with the
introduction of the PCC-IQ "learning" multibrand remote control,
which can be programmed to operate 41 brands of TV sets, 40
brands of VCRs and 50 brands of cable converters.  It can also
learn up to 120 separate functions to control any other device
operated by infrared commands, such as stereos and compact disc.
Shipments are expected first quarter 1990 at about $30 to cable
operators.

FCC ADVISORY COMMITTEE WILL SEE ANOTHER EXTENSION, SIMULCAST
SYSTEMS GAIN FAVOR

     The consensus at the Western show was that the FCC's
Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Services, whose life
was already extended by two years beyond its November 1989
expiration date (VTN, May 15, 1989, p. 3), will need another one-
to two-year extension to complete its task of recommending an
advanced television standard for the U.S.
     Craig Tanner, vice president of advanced television projects
at CableLabs, says that despite the lengthy process of bringing
HDTV to consumers, it's unlikely that the U.S. will follow Tele-
Communication, Inc.'s recommended course of "leapfrogging" analog
HDTV technology by directly implementing digital HDTV as the
technology develops (VTN, April 3, 1989, p. 1).  "It's an
attractive idea but it exists only in concept at this point," he
says.
     Tanner notes that advanced TV experts are leaning toward the
selection of a simulcast system that concurrently transmits one
NTSC signal and one non NTSC-compatible HDTV signal through two
separate 6 MHz channels.  Such a system would leave the HDTV
channel free from the technological constraints of NTSC, and,
eventually, spectrum devoted to original NTSC channels could be
used for other applications (including more advanced versions of
HDTV).
     HDTV transmission proponent North American Philips has
already announced that it is developing a simulcast system it
hopes to submit late in the testing cycle (VTN, Sept. 25, 1989,
p. 3).  Also, the David Sarnoff Research Center is reportedly
working on a simulcast system based on its two-phase augmentation
ACTV system.

CICIORA: CABLE SHOULD WORK ON NTSC IMPROVEMENTS WHILE WAITING FOR
HDTV

     Given the likelihood of delays in testing and standard
setting by the FCC, we won't see HDTV receivers in stores until
Christmas 1994.  Meanwhile, cable should concentrate on
improvements in NTSC delivery, says Walt Ciciora, vice president
of technology for ATC and chairman of CableLabs Technical
Advisory Committee.  "For a long time, NTSC was so much better
than consumer electronics could deliver, and it didn't make sense
to make transmission better than what could be displayed.  Now
the reverse is true," he said.  NTSC enhancements need to be made
not only in the receiver (such as those developed by Faroudja
Laboratories), but in the headend as well through new fiber and
amplifier technologies (see page 1).
     Improving NTSC technology will also prepare the industry for
advanced television.  "HDTV needs more channels, less noise, less
distortion and reduced microreflection--the same requirements for
improved NTSC," said Ciciora.  If the cable industry takes
appropriate steps to improve NTSC, "we'll be in an excellent
position to deliver HDTV long before anyone is willing to spend
money on it".

IMMINENT INVASION OF HDTV VCRs A BOGEYMAN, LONG TERM IMPROVEMENTS
ARE THE THREAT

     Some industry observers, including CableLabs' Tanner,
suspect HDTV may achieve significant penetration of homes sooner
than many predict.  A set of HDTV technologies, including
compression, display, transmission and production, are in "a
state of near readiness," and only need refinement, packaging and
cost reduction for consumer acceptance, says Tanner.  "We should
never underestimate the ability of the Japanese to manufacture at
high volume and low cost," he says.
     But an imminent invasion of Japanese HDTV VCRs will be
staved off by the "consumer electronics constraint," more
commonly known as the chicken-and-the-egg problem, contends
Ciciora.  The long-term development of large screen televisions
and VCRs (or TV/VCR combinations) are the real threat to cable,
since they don't confront the same signal processing problems
that the cable industry faces.  "Over the next 10-15 years, the
TV and VCR baseband path will go from four to nine to 15 to over
20 MHz.  There is no need to compress, so they won't need to
compromise," he says.

CABLE REREGULATION--INCLUDING PROVISIONS FOR TELCO ENTRY--LESS
THAN CERTAIN IN '90

     Even if some type of reregulation of the cable industry is
implemented this year, any bill from Congress is unlikely to
include provisions for telco entry into the video business, said
Congressional staffers speaking at the Western show.  FCC
Chairman Al Sikes has already put in motion the Commission's
review of cable that was originally scheduled to start next
October.  A report providing guidelines for possible reregulation
is expected to be submitted to Congress by the end of July.
     "There is a consensus building that telcos will be in the
cable business, though only as a gateway and not allowed to own
programming," says Toni Cook, Majority Counsel of the Senate
Commerce Committee.  "But there is no consensus as to when that
should happen."  Though cable legislation is "inevitable," the
severity of the bill "is anything but certain," adds Minority
Counsel Terry Haines of the House Commerce Committee.  Haines
says "telco entry is an issue whose time has not come," and says
the FCC's report--if it redefines competition or takes other
significant moves that assuage the concerns of Congress members--
could "take a lot of air out of the legislative balloon."
     Ira Goldman, legislative assistant to Sen. Pete Wilson (R-
CA) says if cable rate regulation does occur, it will take away
one of telco's main contentions for entering the video business--
lower rates through increased competition.  "It may be a great
political move by the cable industry to acquiesce to
legislation," he says.

EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS URGE CABLERS TO "TURN SYNDEX INTO
PROFITS"

     Hampering prospects for happier cable customers is the
implementation of syndication exclusivity ("syndex") regulations
begun January 1, which requires cable operators offering
programming duplicated by broadcasters to replace those slots
with alternative material.  At the Western show, manufacturers of
commercial ad insertion equipment, routing switchers and
character generators took the opportunity to peddle their gear as
a way to "turn syndex into profits" by substituting local
information and advertising.
     No cable show would be complete without a few potshots
thrown between cable operators and telcos. In a panel session on
telco entry into cable, Tele-Communications, Inc. Senior Vice
President John Sie said the unwillingness of telcos to drop basic
telephone rates was evidence of their intent to use
"institutional cross subsidy" for widespread fiber installation.
"If [the telcos] can offer the cable industry a video dial tone
on a open architecture basis, then we should be able to lease
that channel, repackage it and sell phone services at a much
cheaper price," he said.
     Pioneer Communications announced the compatibility of its
laserdisc format with the Eidak system for copy-protected pay-
per-view.  Pioneer was at the show pushing its pay-per-view event
library system, the Pioneer LaserDisc Universal System (VTN, Dec.
18, 1989, p. 8).  Though the technology "is in the works," Eidak
officials say they're not yet ready to announce the availability
of "Eidakizing" a laserdisc as yet.  Eidak was at the show laying
the groundwork for introduction of its satellite-delivered anti-
copy technology for cable systems.  The company also announced
that CableLabs will join major MSOs TCI and Continental as
minority investors in Eidak Corp.
     CableLabs approved a $3.5 million 1990 operating budget at
its annual meeting in Anaheim, with almost $2 million to be spent
on research and development.  Scheduled R&D joint ventures
include an effort with Jerrold's Applied Media Lab to investigate
NTSC picture quality parameters, including five basic forms of
signal degradation (noise, intermodulation, microreflections,
envelope delay and phase noise) and an agreement with Scientific-
Atlanta to research future headend systems.  Anixter Cable TV
(Skokie, IL) introduced a dual laser version of its Laser Link
that allows cable operators to improve system performance by 3
dB.  The dual fiber system can carry 40, 60 or 80 channels, and
operators using a single Laser Link can upgrade to the dual
configuration with a simple plug-in module.

MANUFACTURERS: SHORT TERM PROSPECTS FOR VIDEO BLANK TAPE
STANDARDS NOT GOOD

     It's highly unlikely that we'll see quality standards set
for blank video tape similar to the Type I, II or IV grade
formats used in the audio cassette business--at least until
advanced video technologies raise consumers' quality
expectations.  Blank tape manufacturers surveyed by our sister
publication Video Marketing Newsletter said that 1) consumers
often can't appreciate higher tape quality given the image
quality limitations of existing TVs; 2) VCRs don't have switches
allowing the user to change the bias; and 3) even if they did,
few consumers would use them, since "most consumers aren't even
sure where the tracking control is on their VCR."  Consumers are
generally indifferent to quality now, but that may be changing
with the introduction of new technologies, says Peter Dyke,
national sales manager at TDK.  "As TV improves with high-
definition and S-VHS, people will begin to care about grade.
We've already seen an increase in high-grade tapes being sold."

KODAK DROPPING VIDEO PRESENTATION PRODUCTS, EPSON TO TAKE OVER
LCD PROJECTOR

     Eastman Kodak's decision to shed several subsidiaries will
include selling off its presentation technology division and
discontinuing the LCD-based LC500 Video Projector, a 70,400 line
resolution, full color portable projector for professional
markets.  The decision "is consistent with corporate plans to
focus our efforts... in our core business areas," says James
Parker, manager, American Zone Sales, for Kodak.
     The LC500, which has found a niche in industrial and
education presentation markets, will not disappear, however.
Kodak had been marketing the product in the U.S. since Fall 1988
under license from LC500 developer Seiko Epson Corp. of Japan,
and relinquished marketing rights in November to Epson America,
Inc.  Epson, which has been marketing the projector in Europe and
Japan since its inception, is keeping the unit on U.S. shelves as
the Epson Crystal Image Video Projector.  The projector will
retail near its former $3,495 price tag, says Epson spokesperson
Gary Yoshimura.  The company plans to expand the device's market
potential by promoting it as a standard peripheral display for
personal computers.  (Epson America, Inc., 2780 Lomita Blvd.,

CALIFORNIA FIRM TARGETS HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET WITH 3D MOVIES

     3D TV Corporation, a stereoscopic developer, has devised a
home video system enabling standard television sets and VCRs to
faithfully reproduce 3D images from encoded videocassettes.
     The $200 system, compatible with all videocassette formats
and most television  and computer brands, consists of a pair of
$50 LCD glasses and a $150 cigarette-package-sized Stereo Glasses
Driver.  When the LCD glasses and VCR are plugged into the
glasses driver, the TV screen emits alternating images--first for
the left eye and then for the right.  The glasses, in sequence
with the emitted images, cover the appropriate eye of the viewer
at a rate of 60 times per second so the picture appears in
continual 3D.
     Following its introduction this month at the Consumer
Electronics Show, 3D TV Corp. will begin marketing the system
with distribution through video specialty stores and mail order
firms.  Company President Michael Starks, who hopes to ship
20,000 units in the first six months of 1990, believes consumer
acceptance hinges on 3D software availability and development and
has therefore stockpiled a 20-title 3D library of feature films,
shorts and documentaries.  The 3D cassettes will retail at about
$50, but "could easily be dropped to $19.95 or sell at $79.95.
It's the same pricing strategy as standard videocassettes,"
Starks tells VTN.
    Based on interest expressed by numerus producers who have
recently filmed in 3D or are interested in tackling 3D
productions, Starks hopes to add about six new films to the
library within the next six months.  "There have been about four
or five unreleased 3D feature films made within the last year or
two, and there's always some old 3D `Bs' being discovered in
somebody's basement," he says.  (3D TV Corporation, Box 1650,
Ross, CA 94957; 415-479-3516.)

FLAT PANELS TO INCREASE SHARE OF TOTAL DISPLAY MARKET TO ALMOST
40% BY 1996

     The total world display market will grow from $12.85 billion
in 1989 to $30.42 billion in 1996, and flat panel displays (FPDs)
will increase their share of the market from 25% ($3.2 billion)
to 38% ($11.7 billion) within the same period, according to
figures presented by Stanford Resources, Inc. at its 1989 Flat
Information Display Conference and Exhibition last month in Santa
Clara, CA.
     According to Stanford Resources President Joseph Castellano,
flat panel displays have begun to replace cathode ray tubes in
portable computers, aircraft instruments and portable/table model
color TVs.  For example, FPDs were used in 1.46 million consumer
TVs in 1989, and that number will grow to 9.9 million units in
1996.  However, manufacturers must bring down the production
costs of FPD, as well as provide full color and higher pixel
counts if they are to replace CRTs in the very large TV and
computer segments, he says.
     Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) will continue to account for
the lion's share of FPD revenues (about 57% in 1989, growing to
62% in 1996).  Active matrix LCDs--which have performance levels
similar to that of today's standard cathode ray tube (CRT)--are
currently the focus of heavy investment in Japan.  The complexity
and cost of manufacturing have hampered the production of large-
screen active matrix LCDs though certain manufacturers have made
progress (such as Sharp's 14" LCD screen, VTN, June 12, 1989, p.
5).
     Will flat panel displays provide the missing link--a low-
cost large screen display--for the commercialization of HDTV?
Television manufacturers appear to have little confidence in
large screen FPDs, given the expansion plans for the manufacture
of large size CRTs by Thomson, Matsushita, Toshiba and Sony,
according to David Lachenbruch, editorial director of TV Digest.
Lachenbruch says one promising large screen technology may be LCD
projection systems like the 100" model recently introduced by
Sharp.
     Consultant Dr. Elliot Schlam, however, says flat panel
displays are the ultimate solution for HDTV displays.  CRTs,
which will be used for "improved" definition TV, are too bulky.
Projection systems take up too much space, though they may be
used for HDTV in the near and mid-term.

     *While letterboxing has long been a staple of the laserdisc
market, one home video company--New Yorker Films (New York)--is
including the feature in a number of foreign language features.
Beth deVoe, director of home video for New Yorker, says the
company has always letterboxed its titles for broadcast, and saw
no reason to change the policy in home video.  "We're just taking
exactly what the filmmakers intended and putting it on the
cassette.  There is a slight problem because you have to make a
brand new 35mm print unsubtitled and then put it on cassette and
subtitle it.  It does cost a lot to do it our way, but our
audience are movie buffs, and they're glad we do it."

TELECOM BILL LINGERS AS LAWMAKERS BREAK FOR HOLIDAYS

     Congress adjourned Dec. 22 for Christmas holiday without
filing conference committee report on telecom reform legislation. 
Although Senate Republicans late in day started process of
collecting signatures of conferees, there was no such action with
Senate Democrats or in House, as Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.) didn't
release report for examination and signatures.

     By afternoon of Dec. 22, Senate Republicans and Democrats said
final arrangements had been worked out.  House Democrats were
satisfied with language, pending final examination.  But House
Republicans were split, with at least 3 elements in play.  One was
Commerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.), who urged members to sign
conference report.  One was Telecom Subcommittee Chmn. Fields
(R-Tex.), who from his Houston home called lawmakers to urge them
not to sign conference report.  He had left Washington Dec. 21 to
be with his wife, who is in final stage of pregnancy.  At
leadership meeting morning of Dec. 21, Fields listed his objections
to bill following Bliley's status report, and differences
continued.  Rep. Hastert (R-Ill.), member of leadership and of
Commerce Committee, said members "will have to make up their own
minds" about which side to take.  Industry sources said Fields
reluctantly had decided to sign conference report.  Sources also
said Judiciary Committee Chmn. Hyde (R-Ill.) was asking members not
to sign report.

     Third and final factor is House leadership, Rep. Stearns
(R-Fla.) pointed out.  Despite differences between Fields and
Bliley, no bill will be closed out without leadership approving it,
Stearns said.  At time House adjourned Dec. 22, several Republicans
told us that they still had problems with bill.  As Rep. White
(R-Wash.) said on leaving House chamber:  "We're still working on
it."  Included on list were familiar issues of foreign ownership
and broadcast ownership.  But Reps. Oxley (R-O.) and Goodlatte
(R-Va.) mentioned Internet regulation as point that should be
revisited.  They told us in interviews that there was no reason
that language preventing FCC from regulating content or prices on
Internet should be removed, noting that House had passed it by
large margin.

     Final language agreed to, according to Senate staff, was
little changed from night before, when Commerce Committee Chmn.
Pressler (R-S.D.) said "framework" existed.  Negotiations resulted
in removal of language covering one-year delay in RHC joint
marketing of local and long distance services.  Other than that,
FCC freeze on attribution rules still was out, as were provisions
preventing Commission from regulating Internet, references to
foreign ownership and language to preempt states on price
regulation.  Broadcast ownership language also remained unchanged,
with 35% national audience cap still in place, although FCC could
use its residual waiver authority.  New phrase was added to clarify
Justice Department's role in determining whether RHCs should enter
long distance, saying FCC should give DoJ's opinion "substantial
weight," but "such evaluation shall not have any preclusive effect
on any Commission decision..."

     Despite uncertainty on House side, Sen. Hollings (D-S.C.),
senior Commerce Committee Democrat, said:  "There's no question in
my mind that there's agreement.  It's a good bill and it's agreed
upon.  I think ultimately you've got some political atmospheres
poisoned when the Vice President says he's for it and they [House
Republicans] say, 'We're against it.'  Maybe we can get the Vice
President to announce he opposes it."  Meanwhile, Bradley Stillman,
legislative dir. for Consumer Federation of America, wanted to
correct impression from Oxley, who had said that if CFA supported
bill, it would be victory for regulators.  CFA doesn't support
bill, Stillman said.

     On Dec. 21, House had offered new broadcast diversity
language, which brought immediate response from one network
affiliates group -- letters to President Clinton and Senate
Commerce Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) protesting proposals as
anticompetitive.

     House broadcast proposal would keep in place 35% national cap
on audience share that could be owned by one owner, but at same
time would give FCC ability to grant waiver to lift cap on
case-by-case basis if action wouldn't harm diversity or
competition.  Factors that Commission could consider in making
decision include:  (1) Effect of acquisition on concentration at
national level.  (2) "Actual aggregate" national audience reach in
which one person or company would own or have "cognizable
interest."  (3) Effect on diversity in local market.  (4) Effect on
public interest, convenience, necessity.  Language on "actual
aggregate" audience is one of 2 parts of proposal put in for Fox,
which argues that it should have higher than 35% ownership because
its ratings aren't as high as networks.  Other Fox-backed provision
would prohibit FCC from establishing or modifying any policy or
rule on attribution or calculation of media ownership.  Broadcast
industry source said provision was inconsistent with rest of bill
because it would bar Commission from acting while other parts of
bill would direct FCC to take action.

     Other elements of bill would allow one owner to have 2 VHF
stations in single market with Commission approval under
"extraordinary and compelling circumstances," while setting
standards for diversity that would call for 10 separately owned
stations in top 25 markets, 6 stations in next 75 and 3 in all
other markets.  Consumer representatives criticized bill as
insufficient in protecting public interest.

                      *    *    *    *    *

     Wireless Cable Assn.'s contention that loophole in bill, which
it blamed on Rep. Schaefer (R-Colo.), could hurt that industry (CM
Dec 18 p6) is inaccurate, Schaefer's office said, saying language
on uniform pricing as applied to buildings was Senate offer, not
Schaefer's.  In any case, staffer said, proposal would put burden
on competitor to make case to FCC in complaint, but if Commission
then accepts case, cable operator would have to prove that there's
no predatory pricing by disclosing its costs of service.  In
addition, current proposals deregulate SMATV operators by leaving
them out of definition of cable operator if system doesn't cross
public rights-of-way.  Provisions weren't drawn up with Liberty
Cable situation in mind, Schaefer staffer said.  Liberty has
protested that language could hurt it in competitive battle with
Time Warner.

JUSTICE DEPT., BROADCASTERS OPPOSE QUICK MUST-CARRY DECISION; 
CABLE DISAGREES

     U.S. Supreme Court shouldn't set expedited schedule for
must-carry appeal because main legal arguments already have been
decided, leaving only voluminous factual record to consider,
Justice Dept. and broadcasters said in opposition to cable bid for
quick action.  Brief signed by Solicitor Gen. Drew Days also said
expedited schedule would be hardship for govt. because of federal
shutdown and holidays.

     But cable interests don't seek shortened briefing schedule,
merely quick decision to take case that would allow it to be heard
this term, cable groups said in reply brief.  NCTA and programmers
repeated that they're willing to shorten their own briefing time if
necessary to get decision this term.  Size of record doesn't make
quick decision impossible, they said, because dispute isn't over
facts, only over legal significance of facts.  Brief also said
majority opinion upholding must-carry wasn't majority at all
because one judge backed full hearing on merits.

     Court "would not be well served by rushed proceedings in this
case," Justice Dept. said, because, contrary to cable claims,
"principal doctrinal issues in the case" were settled by Supreme
Court in earlier decision (CM July 4/94 p1).  Now, Court must
evaluate tens of thousands of pages of evidence submitted to lower
court to determine whether Congress had enough evidence to back its
decision to impose must-carry.

     Court could decide quickly to uphold must-carry, said joint
brief by NAB, INTV, APTS, PBS, CPB.  However, they said it took 5
months for lower court to consider evidence and uphold
congressional action:  "Obviously, even greater care would be
required before this Court could reverse that judgment and strike
down a presumptively constitutional statute... No matter how much
this appeal was expedited, it would not be possible for this Court
to decide the case in [cable's] favor this term."

     Other arguments in broadcast and govt. briefs include:  (1)
Justice said many federal legal, paralegal and clerical staff
employees were on furlough, making it difficult to comply with
expedited schedule.  (2) Broadcasters said record shows that
must-carry impact on cable has been de minimis, since growth in
channel capacity every 26 days equals total impact of must-carry on
channel capacity.  (3) Broadcasters said cable programmers have
more, not less, carriage and subscribership since must-carry began,
so impact is minimal.  (4) Broadcasters, countering cable argument
that quick decision is needed because next date for selecting
between must-carry and retransmission consent is Oct., said any
burden of that deadline is on broadcasters, who are willing to
accept it.  (5) Broadcasters said coming FCC decision on must-carry
for advanced TV doesn't require quick decision because no advanced
TV will enter service before Court's next term.

     Cable had hoped to know by end of last week whether Supreme
Court will expedite appeal of must-carry.  NCTA, Turner Bcstg.,
Time Warner, Discovery and Atlanta Interfaith Bcstrs. had filed
appeal of U.S. Dist. Court decision and request for expedited
treatment on Dec. 21.

     Dist. Court used wrong definition of broadcasting in its
narrow decision upholding must-carry, original cable brief said. 
Lower court said must-carry is needed to protect individual
broadcasters, rather than broadcasting industry as whole, according
to brief, and industry as whole is healthy:  "The government
effectively concedes that the broadcasting system as a whole is not
in economic jeopardy."  Individual stations that might not be
carried without must-carry usually are little watched and in
communities with unusually high number of stations, cable said.

     Must-carry is too restrictive in protecting broadcasting,
cable said.  If goal is to prevent cable's anticompetitive
behavior, there are less restrictive ways than imposing must-carry
on every cable operator, original brief said.  Other cable
arguments:  (1) Must-carry limits speech of cable programmers
because of channel capacity limits.  (2) Many benefits could be
realized through A/B switches and leased access channels.  (3) Cost
of must-carry on freedom of speech is too high.  (4) "Substantial
First Amendment challenge" shouldn't be decided because one judge
was reluctant to require full trial.

FCC PLANS TO HOMOGENIZE CABLE AND TELCO WIRING REGULATION

     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home
wiring rules between telcos and cable, saying change is needed
because of convergence of industries.  Rulemaking will deal with
demarcation between customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal
leakage and quality, technical standards, customer-premises
equipment (CPE), division of state and federal responsibilities. 
In separate decision, FCC significantly eased limits on amount of
cable costs that can be included in cost-of-service rate
proceedings.

     Regulation of cable and telcos should be comparable "where
appropriate," FCC Comr. Ness said, and Commission should deregulate
"where it makes sense."  Comr. Chong said rulemaking launched Dec.
15 is significant improvement over previous drafts, which she said
didn't recognize impact of convergence of industries.  She said she
would have preferred to move demarcation point immediately, but
went along with rulemaking "since we have agreed to move swiftly." 
Chmn. Hundt said owning wiring "can be a tremendous competitive
advantage" for incumbent, and new rules could make cable CPE market
as competitive as telephone equipment market.  Comr. Quello
expressed concern about burden of new rules on incumbents and said
benefits are "difficult to quantify."

     Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1) What demarcation point would
be appropriate, acknowledging it might be different for
single-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2) Whether telcos'
broadband services should have to meet same signal leakage and
signal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable should have
to standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system, as telcos
have for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same regulatory
distinctions between residential and nonresidential wiring as
telcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to in-home
broadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to divide
regulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise authorities,
states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal regulation of
telephony and video programming.

     FCC tentatively concluded that cable customers should have
same rights to connect their own CPE to cable as telco customers
have.  It also said it believes that it may be appropriate to
deregulate cable equipment rates after market becomes competitive
and after transition period.  Rulemaking seeks comment on whether
Commission has authority to deregulate equipment rates.

     As result of wiring rulemaking, FCC rejected petitions for
reconsideration filed by Nynex and others asking that demarcation
point between customer-owned and operator-owned wiring for multiple
dwelling units be moved.  Chong said demarcation point, currently
12" outside subscriber premises, often isn't accessible to rivals,
so it reduces likelihood of competition.  Commission did set
rulemaking to determine whether persons other than individual
subscribers should be able to buy wiring in some circumstances.

     In response to separate petition, Commission also amended
rules on wiring procedures when customer terminates service.  New
rules shorten period operator has to remove wiring to 7 days from
30, set specific procedures for notifying ex-customer and amount
customer should pay for wiring, and say customer automatically owns
it if operator doesn't comply.

     New cost-of-service (COS) rules sharply increase amount of
intangible assets that cable operators can include in cost base to
justify rate of return.  Operators now can include only such
intangible assets as organizational costs, franchise costs,
customer lists.  Impact of action was somewhat limited, however,
because of volume of negotiated rate settlements that FCC has
approved, which limits MSOs' COS filings.  Commissioners said eased
rules are justified by agency's increasing knowledge of
complexities of cable industry.  "With age comes wisdom," Quello
said.  Ness said first rules were set "in an incredibly tight time
frame" and FCC now can tailor them better to specific needs of
cable industry.  Fact that Congress appears likely to retain cable
rate regulation "has to be read as a testament to" Cable Bureau's
successful implementation, Hundt said.

     Commission's earlier rules had said that cable operators could
include in cost base virtually none of cost of buying systems
beyond that of tangible assets.  That decision was based on
assumption that system sales prices were inflated based on
expectation of monopoly profits.  New COS rules assume that 66% of
purchase price of systems bought before May 15, 1994, can be
included in base.  New rules also allow operators to include
virtually all of their startup losses in cost base, rather than
just those accumulated in first 2 years.

     FCC will continue to assume current 11.25% rate of return is
appropriate, but started rulemaking to determine whether operators
should be allowed to try to justify higher return based on debt
cost and capital structure.  In other decisions, Commission
declared that:  (1) Systems can include cost of unused channels in
cost base as long as they will be used for regulated service within
12 months.  (2) Assets must be depreciated over useful life, not
over remaining term of franchise, because of presumption that
franchise will be renewed.  (3) Operators can put nonregulated
costs into single "all other" category instead of several.

SOME CABLE LEGAL WORK SLOWING AS REGULATION PASSES PEAK

     End of first round of cable rate cases and industry
consolidation is causing some dislocations among cable attorneys,
but most big law firms we surveyed said work merely was shifting
and some were busier than ever.  Big mergers and cable system sales
are definitely affecting some lawyers.  "There has been a big
consolidation within the industry, which means fewer entities to
represent," said Richard Wiley of Wiley, Rein & Fielding.  "The
impact is significant."  Most top lawyers predicted that telecom
reform legislation would mean even bigger wave of work.

     Despite rumors that some top cable firms were laying off
associates, none we talked with said they were cutting staff, and
most said they were adding personnel.  Cole, Raywid & Braverman,
which devotes 80-90% of its time to cable and has been subject of
rumors since releasing several associates, has added more staff
members than have departed, John Cole said:  "We've been relatively
busy and we've been hiring.  We've been very busy on franchise
renewals and things like that, and the rate work continues."

     Regardless, raft of cable rulemakings, rate cases, must-carry
and program access complaints and other Cable Act-related issues
that caused cable law boom starting in 1993 has tapered off.  As
FCC rationalizes rate rules and moves toward annual, instead of
quarterly, cable rate-setting, and cases become more routine,
there's less legal work to be done.  There has been trend toward
moving such routine cable legal work to in-house lawyers from
outside law firms, several attorneys said, and they indicated that
they have been encouraging trend because of its heavy reliance on
number-crunchers rather than legal expertise.  However, one lawyer
said reliance on in-house counsel doesn't always result in net loss
of legal business because corporate lawyers often seek backup of
outside law firms.

     Some new legal staffers have different skills because of
changing environment.  Frank Lloyd of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris,
Glovsky & Popeo, said his firm's last 5-6 hires have been lawyers
with common carrier backgrounds.  "The nature of cable legal work
is different," he said.  "A huge proportion of the FCC work is
moving to the Common Carrier Bureau because so many of our clients
want to move into telephony."  Lloyd said cable clients also are
becoming involved in such typical common carrier cases as universal
service, interoperability, number portability, access.  "Hopefully,
most cable lawyers have already been trying to learn [common
carrier] for a few years," he said.  "We started with VDT and built
on that."

     First wave of cable rate cases has crested, said Seth Davidson
of Fleischman & Walsh, but that's just normal "ebb and flow" of
cable law.  He said cable lawyers remain busy with other issues,
including recent cable wiring and rate rulemakings issued by FCC: 
"We've been busy as all get-out.  I am just swamped."  Lloyd said
rate cases are "a very narrow subset" of cable law, and many
lawyers are happy to have fewer of such cases, which have become
relatively routine:  "I like to deal with the bigger issues of
getting my clients into new businesses."

     Most other cable regulatory issues, notably must-carry and
related points, still remain "very active," Lloyd said.  Wiley said
his firm remains busy with programmer issues, and that's likely to
get even more active as channel capacity crunch eases.

     Consolidation of industry has affected some lawyers.  John
Davis of Wiley, Rein, for example, decided to retire at least
temporarily when clients such as Providence Journal and Sammons
chose to leave cable business.  Davis, who also cited other reasons
for retiring, said result is "same number of lawyers chasing fewer
clients."

     Municipal attorneys report similar industry and regulatory
changes that have forced some repositioning.  Washington lawyer
Patrick Grant of Arnold & Porter said workload hasn't decreased,
but most rate-setting work is over.  He said calculating annual
increases -- now allowed for inflation and external costs -- is far
less complex than initial task of deciphering first and 2nd FCC
rate orders.  One change among cities, Grant said, is that "there's
beginning to develop a bit of a shift from traditional regulation
to a more broad-based focus on [telecom] infrastructure
development," which requires both video and telephony expertise. 
Aside from that, he said, there's still "slew of renewals" that
require legal guidance.

     Eileen Huggard, exec. dir. of National Assn. of
Telecommunications Officers & Advisers (NATOA), said infrastructure
work is "pretty large undertaking" that more cities are studying --
often with help of legal consultants and Washington lawyers.  In
most states, she said, cities still have greater jurisdiction over
video than telephony side of any telecom network, so lawyers with
cable expertise still are in demand.

     Municipal lawyer Joe Van Eaton of Miller, Canfield, Paddock &
Stone said his firm remains busy on cable matters but work directly
related to rate setting has slowed, partly because of perception
created by FCC social contracts and mass rate settlements: 
"Everyone realizes that it doesn't matter [how much cabler charges]
-- the FCC is going to find a way to give it back to the operator." 
He said industry consolidations had spurred work on franchise
transfers.

     Telecom legislation could mean "a boom time for communications
lawyers for a while," Wiley said:  "There will be a tremendous net
gain [in work] for the short term, though I don't know what it
means downstream.  For the short term, the FCC will be very busy
[with rulemakings], and that means lawyers will be very busy." 
Telecom bill "will mean another 3 years of rate regulation," Lloyd
agreed.  Davis said "it will be a whole new world" if legislation
passes:  "Any time there's uncertainty it breeds caution, and that
means work for lawyers.  The government always seems to find a way
to pick up the slack."

DENVER LAWYER FILES CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST TCI'S LATE FEES

     Denver lawyer Steven Zapiler has filed class action suit
against TCI-owned Mile Hi Cable, alleging that company's $5
"administrative fee" for late payments is "capricious,
unreasonable, unconscionable, arbitrary" and has "no rational
relationship to the presumed and/or actual damages to TCI."  At
same time, Louisville lawyer Mark Fischer took out ad in Lexington
Herald-Leader, complete with 800 number, for prospective plaintiffs
in attempt to build class action case against TCI's Telecable on
late fee issue.  Telecable also charges $5.

     Cases are among those resurrecting late fee issue, which has
been relatively dormant in recent years because of scurrying over
1992 Cable Act, as deregulatory focus of federal telecom bill
threatens local control over cable rates.  One municipal attorney
said issue has "arisen time and again over the years" and may see
new life as other regulatory issues subside.  Others said similar
cases may be on horizon in Cal. and elsewhere.

     Denver suit claims that plaintiffs were "financially injured"
by late fee, which is attempt to "blatantly and illegally extract
additional revenue and profits from its subscribers, by
sidestepping federal, state and local laws and regulations."  Among
questions cited by Zapiler were whether TCI:  (1) Made clear or
intended that fees cover liquidated damages and, if so, that it
should be $5.  (2) Made any attempt to determine or estimate actual
losses from late payments and whether they had "reasonable
relationship" to fees.  (3) Had difficulty determining relationship
between fees and damages.  (4) Imposed fees that were "penal in
nature."  However, suit contends that language of late fee
agreement was "created and drafted unilaterally" by operator on
"take-it-or-leave-it basis," leaving subscribers "without
sufficient bargaining power to compel [TCI] to negotiate, bargain
for, and/or obtain terms other than those imposed by [TCI]."

     Fischer said he expects to file similar class action suit
against Telecable in early Jan. after he finishes nailing down "a
couple of loose ends.  He said newspaper ad prompted "a lot of
response" but he hasn't decided which subscribers will become
principal complainants, or whether suit will focus on state or
federal statutes.  He said both are relevant but he won't disclose
specific details until he completes filing.  However, he said state
law is clearer than "murkier" federal statutes -- some involving
1992 Cable Act that, according to Fischer, may contain language
that could help case.

     Late fees weren't addressed directly in 1992 Cable Act, partly
because they're largely matter of state and local law.  Washington
attorney Joe Van Eaton said most states set parameters for late
fees based on administrative costs associated with delayed payment,
including whether operator could have earned interest on money had
it been paid on time.  In most states, he said, "if it exceeds
that, then it's a problem."

FCC VOTES TO PROCEED WITH DBS AUCTION THIS MONTH, SOME PARTIES
RESTRICTED

     FCC voted 5-0 on circulation to auction DBS slots and
frequencies reclaimed from Advanced Communications after company
failed to meet due diligence requirements.  Comrs. Quello and
Barrett voted for item but dissented in part.  Auction is scheduled
for Jan. 18 and MCI has said it intends to open bidding at $175
million.  Advanced attorney Robert Corn-Revere said decision to
proceed with auction was no surprise:  "It was a foregone
conclusion.  The auction was the point of cancelling Advanced's
permit."  Company has appealed decision to revoke its permit, and
oral argument is set for March 19 in U.S. Appeals Court, D.C.

     Rules approved by FCC include restrictions on ability of
existing DBS operators from participating.  "Single spectrum cap"
would limit companies' ability to control more that one
full-continental U.S. slot, meaning that DirecTV, EchoStar and
other DBS permittees are precluded from entering auction unless
they divest other holdings.  Similarly, if TCI-controlled Primestar
wins auction for Advanced's slot at 110 degrees W, TCI-controlled
Tempo would have to divest interest in 119 degrees W slot.

     FCC didn't preclude cable companies from participating in
auction.  International Bureau Chief Scott Harris said rules were
designed to provide balance between various concerns and to foster
competition.  He said certain anticompetitive restrictions that
were in notice of proposed rulemaking were removed as unnecessary
because of limit on number of slots one company can control.  "We
found the right balance with these rules," he said.

     Electronic auctions will consist of sequential multiple rounds
that will award 2 permits, one for 28 channels at 110 degrees W and
another for 24 channels at 148 degrees W.  FCC Wireless Bureau was
given authority to implement and modify DBS auctions procedures. 
Commission said that prior method of redistributing reclaimed DBS
resources (they were made available to other DBS permittees that in
essence formed line) "no longer serves the public interest, and
that the use of competitive bidding would promote the rapid
deployment of DBS service and the efficient use of DBS spectrum
more effectively than any other assignment method."

     Critics of proceeding say best way to promote rapid deployment
of DBS would be to allow Primestar to continue with plans to deploy
2 high-power satellites in 1996.  Those birds are under
construction at Space/Systems Loral plant in Cal.  Winner of
auction has 4 years to construct and launch single satellite or 6
years to construct and launch multiple satellite system.  Critics
also said that winner of auction could delay construction for up to
6 months pending decision of Appeals Court, which could void
auction results.  Industry source said reason FCC proceeded with
auction and didn't wait for court was because "they want to prove
that they can do it [approve auction rules] quickly."  However,
Harris has said that Bureau's decision to cancel Advanced's permit
will withstand judicial scrutiny because company clearly didn't
meet its due diligence requirements.

DAVIC AGREES ON WORLDWIDE INTERACTIVE TV STANDARDS

     Standards for interactive TV and digital set-top boxes were
approved on Dec. 16 by Digital Audio-Visual Council (DAVIC) at
meeting in Berlin.  DAVIC also moved high-speed cable modems to top
priority for next step of process, and even agreed to special
meeting in May to increase likelihood that modem standard will be
set in June.  Approval of DAVIC 1.0 standard is "historic moment"
and moves industry "much closer to a world that is better
connected," said DAVIC council member Robert Luff,
Scientific-Atlanta chief technical officer-broadband.

     DAVIC 1.0 sets worldwide standard for wide range of digital
interactive services, including video, voice and data, as well as
for set-top boxes to be used by cable, telcos, satellites.  Luff
described 1.0 as "core" standard that will be added to, probably as
often as every 6 months, as new technologies develop.  He said core
standards probably won't change for foreseeable future, with later
additions to be compatible with and build upon 1.0:  "This is a
giant step toward interconnectivity.  We will have this as a base
for other applications to build from, and it will create stability
for content developers."

     DAVIC's 205 member companies should receive text of 1.0
standard by 2nd week of Jan., Luff said, and it will be available
on-line soon after.  Standard then will go to ITU for what's likely
to be relatively automatic approval, which Luff said typically
would occur in about 3 months.

     "Phenomenal rise" of Internet and World Wide Web were major
issues at Berlin meeting, Luff said, causing DAVIC board to move
on-line standards to "highest priority" for next 6 months.  Goal is
to have on-line connection standards approved as part of DAVIC 1.1
by June, he said, in part because of fear that if there's no
standard by then, equipment makers will launch their modems anyway,
which Luff said could cause "some chaos."  DAVIC meeting in May
(date and location not set) was added because there wouldn't be
enough meetings before June in N.Y.C. to approve on-line standard
by June.

     DAVIC group is working closely with CableLabs, Luff said. 
Cablelabs is developing cable modem standard, and he expressed
confidence that any differences between standards would be
minimized.  He said goal is to allow PC users to access cable media
servers, at least to browse if not to receive full movies, and
DAVIC users to be able to access Internet:  "This is a very
important, do-able goal."

     In addition to modem standard, DAVIC hopes 1.1 will include
standards for digital wireless cable.  It also issued call for
standards proposals for return channels for satellite, modulation
schemes for LMDS, application software portability, security
systems.  Later call for proposals includes 3-D animation and
synthetic sound, higher quality video and audio, modulation plans
for terrestrial VHF/UHF, distributed servers, high bandwidth 2-way
audiovisual, content acquisition and production, multimedia mobile
wireless.

     DAVIC 1.0 includes QAM modulation for hybrid fiber/coaxial
systems, as expected (CM June 26 p3), QPSK modulation for

CAL. PUC ADOPTS FINAL TELECOM COMPETITION RULES, GIVES OKAY TO 31
ENTRANTS

     Cal. PUC on Dec. 20 approved rules to open local telephone
loop Jan. 1 and granted certificates to 31 companies that hope to
become local exchange carriers (LECs).  They include broad
cross-section of telecom industry and at least one electric
utility.  PUC said rules are "largely the same" as proposed
regulations released in July (CM July 31 p8) that set broader
outline for opening markets.  Meanwhile, PUC adopted 3-year freeze
on price caps for Pacific Bell (PB) and GTE, and lowered
productivity factor to rate of inflation because "underlying
assumptions and data" that created current 5% factor are
"obsolete."  Commission also granted some increases for 4 small
telcos.

     Companies that won certificates:  Advantage Communications,
Assoc. Group, AT&T Communications, Brooks Fiber (of Bakersfield,
Fresno, Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton), Cable Plus, Century
Telecommunications, Continental Telecommunications, Electric
Lightwave, Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST Pacific
Lightwave, GTE-Cal., GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG Access
Services, Info-Tech Communications, Linkatel Pacific, MCI Metro
Access Transmission Services, MFS Intelenet, NewTelco, Nextlink,
Pacific Bell, Pac-West Telecomm, TCG (of L.A., San Diego, San
Francisco), Viacom Communications, Winstar Wireless.

     New rules set terms for interconnection, interim number
portability (through remote call forwarding) and universal service,
PUC said, and keep "same level of access" for deaf and disabled
residents.  PUC said it will determine cost of remote call
forwarding in separate proceeding early in 1996.  All telecom
providers will have to provide 911 access, directory databases and
"warm-line service," which allows residents to access emergency
services even if phone has been disconnected for other calls. 
Rules contain provisions to protect against slamming by requiring
written confirmation of each sale, with description of services and
price breakdowns.

     One of biggest cable players is Continental, which said its
certificate covers counties of Fresno, Kings, L.A., Madera, Orange,
Riverside, San Joaquin, Sutter, Tulare, Yuba.  Company said it
plans telephony tests in 3rd quarter of 1996, with full deployment
in 1997, and will use AT&T Network Systems' switches, Synchronous
Optical Network (SONET) digital technology.

     PUC also released its report to state legislature on how
competition may affect universal service and proposed that basic
service include 911 access, free customer service, directory
assistance, others.  It also proposed high-cost voucher fund to
subsidize companies in rural areas and said it would lobby
legislature to change existing law to make change possible. 
Voucher system would set credits on customer bills to make sure
they received subsidy regardless of chosen provider, PUC said, and
would base amount of subsidy on cost-rate differential with
incentives to improve efficiency.  It floated idea of competitive
bidding for subsidy and said it would decide issue by June. 
Commission proposed grant programs to hook up libraries and schools
to new telecom services through bill surcharge, taxes on sale of
telecom products, or mandated discounts.  All companies also should
meet same service quality standards, PUC said.

RUMORED BELL ATLANTIC-NYNEX MERGER SEEN AS FIRST OF MANY UNDER A
NEW LAW

     Reported Bell Atlantic (BA)-Nynex merger discussions could be
first of several megamergers triggered by new law, leaving fewer
than half-dozen national providers, financial analysts said. 
Goldman, Sachs, PaineWebber, Smith Barney, UBS Securities and
Prudential Securities said they expect some level of consolidation
in 1996 as companies seek quick access into newly competitive
markets.  BA and Nynex already:  (1) Have merged cellular operation
into Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile.  (2) Have joint $100-million
investment in CAI wireless cable operator.  (3) Own 50% of PCS
Primeco partnership with U S West and AirTouch, which apparently
fueled speculation if not actual discussions, observers said. 
Others said Ameritech could be 3rd merger partner.

     Companies declined comment on report in Wall St. Journal that
they're discussing merger to create nearly $30-billion behemoth --
No. 2 telecom company to AT&T -- to gain entry into long distance. 
"We don't comment on speculation," Nynex spokeswoman James DePeau
said.  "I can neither confirm nor deny" reports, BA spokesman Eric
Rabe said.  Companies had $13 billion each in revenue in 1995 and
project $28 billion combined for 1996.  BA stock has climbed $8 per
share in recent weeks.  However, merger requires passage of telecom
reform bill now in conference in Congress. 

     Industry observers said merger talks would make most sense for
east coast companies, considering traffic volume between BA region,
which includes Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia, and Nynex
region, which covers N.Y. and Boston.  By merging, companies easily
could convert local network to provide long distance services in
corridor without paying access charges now paid by IXCs.  Analysts
estimate 40-60% of U.S. long distance calls originate or terminate
in BA-Nynex region, which would give companies additional clout in
negotiating access agreements with out-of-region LECs.

     Rush to find partners is likely to create no more than 6
behemoths providing full-service offerings, with AT&T and possibly
Sprint cable venture among finishers, with others less certain,
said Michael Elling, senior analyst, Prudential Securities, N.Y. 
Paging companies already are rushing to consolidate operations,
seeking national presence.  "These companies know they have to get
together," Elling told us.  "There can't be 20 large
facilities-based companies competing for business."  He cited
development of cable modems and PCS networks as technologies that
will destabilize local loop competition in 1996.

     Combined company would have revenues close to $28 billion,
given $27.1 billion generated separately in 1994 and $20 billion
total through 3rd quarter 1995.  Companies currently have imbalance
in efficiency, with BA at 30 employees per 10,000 lines, compared
with 37 at Nynex, with both aiming for 20 per 10,000, UBS
Securities said.  Companies cover 13 states from Me. to Va. and
west to W.Va., regions with more than 65 million residents, with
phone penetration exceeding 95% in New England, Pa., Del. and Va. 
Vt. and Va. exceed 98%;  D.C. has least at 92.8%.

CABLE CONSORTIUM COMES UP SHORT AS CANADA ISSUES 2 DBS LICENSES

     Canadian DBS providers ExpressVu and Power DirecTV have
received licenses from Canadian Radio, TV & Telecom Commission
(CRTC) to begin service in June.  CRTC denied license to joint
venture of Shaw Communications and consortium of cable operators
that had applied to launch Homestar service, Canadian equivalent of
Primestar, citing what it called "significant concerns" over
whether Homestar could implement its application.  CRTC also
approved 5 applications for direct-to-home (DTH) ventures.

     Homestar had planned to use Primestar signal when that company
switched to DBS, but now it's uncertain how Primestar will fare in
U.S. DBS auctions by FCC Jan. 24.  As result, it's unclear where
Homestar would get its U.S. programs.  Company said it was
"disappointed," had planned more than 70 video and 35 digital music
services.  Homestar, like Primestar, would have offered rental
dishes to subscribers and would have been 80% Canadian-owned.  CRTC
said it recognized need for DBS to be alternative to cable in rural
areas as well as competitor elsewhere, and it will open another
round of DBS applications to cable providers no sooner than 6
months after ExpressVu and Power DirecTV begin.  Shaw Pres.-COO
James Shaw said company would "actively pursue this opportunity."

     Power DirecTV, owned by Power Bcstg. (80.01%) and DirecTV,
plans to broadcast U.S. and Canadian programming via DirecTV and
Telesat Anik E-2, respectively.  License, to expire in Aug. 2002,
will be issued as soon as Power DirecTV is incorporated in Canada. 
Power DirecTV had wanted CRTC to levy fee on cable subscribers to
help pay for its communications costs, but agency denied request.

     CRTC approved following U.S.-based services for distribution
by Power DirecTv:  A&E, BET, Comedy Central, CNBC/Financial News
Network, CNN, CNN Headline News, C-SPAN, Kaleidoscope, KRMA-TV
(PBS) Denver,  KTLA (Ind.) L.A.,  Learning Channel, Lifetime TV,
Nashville Network, WABC-TV (ABC) N.Y., Weather Channel, WFLD (Fox)
Chicago, WGN-TV (Ind.) Chicago, WPIX (Ind.) N.Y.,  WRAL-TV (CBS)
Raleigh-Durham, WSBK-TV (Ind.) Boston, WTBS (Ind.) Atlanta, WWOR-TV
(Ind.) N.Y.-Secaucus, N.J., WXIA-TV (NBC) Atlanta.

     ExpressVu, which would use Anik E-1 beginning in June, is
owned by BCE Inc. (33-1/3%), Tee-Comm Electronics (33-1/3%),
Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom, 19%), WIC Western
International (14-1/3%).  U.S.-based channels would include:  A&E,
BET, CNBC/Financial News Network, CNN, CNN Headline News, Comedy
Central, C-SPAN, Kaleidoscope, KTLA L.A., Learning Channel,
Lifetime TV, Nashville Network, WDIV (NBC) Detroit, Weather
Channel, WTBS Atlanta, WGN-TV Chicago, WPIX N.Y., WSBK-TV Boston,
WTOL-TV (CBS) Toledo, WTVS (PBS) Detroit, WUHF-TV (Fox) Rochester,
WWOR-TV N.Y.-Secaucus, WXYZ-TV (ABC) Detroit.

     CRTC Chmn. Keith Spicer said Commission's decision introduces
competition and provides alternative to cable.  Licenses require
use of Canadian rather than U.S programming when similar services
are available and would minimize ratio of U.S.-to-Canadian services
providers can offer.  Commission decided not to regulate DBS rates,
as it does cable, saying that it believes competition between 2
services would keep prices low.

     CRTC also licensed 4 English-language and one French-language
DTH, pay-per-view services.  Sports/Specials and Power DirecTicket
will be distributed nationally, Home Theatre will serve Western
Canada, Viewer's Choice Eastern Canada.  Canal Premiere, French
service, will be offered nationally.  CRTC licensed 4 digital pay
audio services for carriage by all distribution systems, including
DTH, cable and DBS:  Allegro, DMX Canada, Galaxie, Power Music
Choice.  Commission rejected application by Power DirecTV to
operate French-language DTH pay-per-view because of concerns it
wouldn't meet Bcstg. Act terms.  CRTC projected in its ruling that
service would lose $3.7 million over 7 years and probably wouldn't
be able to offer as many Canadian-based programs as Act mandates.

     Ohio PUC received flood of comments on its generic competition

     Ohio PUC received flood of comments on its generic competition
docket, which proposes rules to open local loop.  TW recommended
PUC adopt bill-and-keep interconnection and regulatory parity to
"not unduly burden new entrants with requirements designed for
regulated monopolies."  It also urged PUC to scrap proposed rules'
current service area definition that it said "reflect[s] a
one-provider, one-technology world" and instead allow technology
and markets to define it, and exempt facilities-based entrants from
having to resell services "before they have an opportunity to get
into the business."  Ameritech charged that proposed rules would
"violate the public interest test" by allowing entrants to bundle
service offerings and escape universal service obligations while
denying same benefits to Ameritech, which would be forced to charge
"uneconomic" wholesale interconnection rates.  Ohio Office of
Consumer Counsel (OCC) suggested that PUC add to its proposal,
among other things, more specifics on universal service, basic
service tariff requirements, 3-year exemption from competition for
small telcos, bill-and-keep interconnection regime to account for
traffic imbalances.

     Bell Atlantic (BA) submitted price cap plan to Md. PSC that
proposes 5 categories:  (1) "Access," covering long distance
connections.  (2) "Basic-Residential" for nonbusiness lines.  (3)
"Basic-Other" for business lines.  (4) Discretionary, covering
optional services such as call waiting and call forwarding.  (5)
Competitive, for services offered by other providers such as
Centrex and speed dialing.  BA said it will cap access and
basic-residential rates for 2 years, basic-other for one year. 
After that, BA said, it would adjust services based on Gross
Domestic Product price index minus 1.5%.  Discretionary services
wouldn't rise more than 25% per year, BA said, but competitive
services would be unregulated.  It also said plan would preserve
existing quality-of-service standards.  MCI submitted its own price
cap plan for BA last month that it claimed would shave $72 million
off intrastate toll rates.  BA has criticized plan as
"rate-of-return in sheep's clothing," saying it underestimated
universal service costs by $47 million (CM Nov 27 p8).

     FCC at agenda meeting in mid-Dec. proposed compensation

     FCC at agenda meeting in mid-Dec. proposed compensation
arrangements for LEC-wireless interconnection that would mandate
interim use of "bill-and-keep" as reimbursement method.  Under
bill-and-keep, each carrier terminates calls for others at no
charge.  Commissioners said bill-and-keep isn't ideal system, but
speed is of essence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an
economically perfect system would be the enemy of the economic
good."  Beauty of bill-and-keep is that it's "administratively
simple," Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney said, because it
doesn't require setting up new billing systems.  Although it
considers bill-and-keep "preferred" solution, Commission will seek
comments on other options such as setting uniform rate, charging
whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs to terminate calls, picking
up one of various state solutions.  Comr. Ness said she would be
willing to listen if someone came up with better system "but it's
got to be less regulatory and it's got to be speedy."  Need for
state role was emphasized, with Chmn. Hundt noting, "we have a good
relationship with the state commissions and we don't want to lose
it... We want to work with them."  Key issue affecting state PUCs
is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastate traffic. 
Commission invited comments on whether it should adopt
interconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatory
commissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.

     Small Cable Business Assn. (SCBA) fired another salvo in its
campaign to stop proposed Time Warner-Turner Bcstg. and Walt
Disney-Cap/ABC mergers because of concerns that consolidations
could further limit small cablers' access to programming (CM Dec 11
p6/Oct 2 p2).  SCBA attorney Eric Breisach sent letter to FCC
opposing Disney-Cap/ABC request for expedited action and repeated
request that Commission investigate allegations of companies'
discrimination against small operators.  SCBA also submitted
additional information on programming costs to FTC in accordance
with that agency's  request.  SCBA said Turner Bcstg. provides
programming on fair basis but Time Warner doesn't.

STAR/WEB TURBOCHARGES DATA ACCESS VIA WEB BROWSERS

"Nobody does real database searches on the Web," goes one
common complaint from observers of today's booming interest in
the Internet, and particularly the World Wide Web.  Such
comments reflect the fact that much of the information
available on the Net is not yet organized for access using
well-established information retrieval techniques.

Now that will change, with the introduction by Los
Angeles-based Cuadra Associates of STAR/Web, an option to the
company's powerful STAR information management and retrieval
software. STAR/Web is a common gateway interface (cgi-bin)
program that connects STAR software to any standard or
commercial World Wide Web server (http daemon). With STAR/Web,
database administrators can let users of their Web hosts or
hosts on their in-house networks use common web browsers, such
as Mosaic or Netscape Navigator, to search with ease for
information organized and structured into online databases.

Provides lightning fast in-depth searches

STAR/Web offers database administrators a simple way to set up
fully interactive, fast data retrieval for users of Web
browsers for complex searches by users who may know little or
nothing about the structure and content of the data. STAR/Web
is ideal for searching databases significant in size and in
the types of information catalogued. STAR sites include
libraries, museums, archives, government agencies, and other
institutions with catalogs of unique print and non-print
collections. When any of these organizations make their STAR
databases available on the Internet through a STAR/Web host,
users will be able to find hidden treasures of photographic
and film collections, as well as literature in many different
disciplines.

STAR/Web customizable assisted-search capabilities give
end-users heightened information retrieval power without
having to become experts in formulating good searches or to
invest in extensive training for many different databases.
System administrators can design web pages for full-text or
index searches that include multiple input boxes. Index
displays on the assisted search screens help end-users select
applicable search terms to be pasted into the appropriate
input boxes-with copy and paste done automatically.
Administrators may pre- define applicable Boolean, proximity,
and ranging operators for the assisted searches.

STAR/Web sites can commercialize their online services with
ordering facilities (e.g., for full-text document delivery;
reproductions of photographs or slides). If STAR/Web is used
in-house, "service" centers can fulfill requests
enterprise-wide for library books, journal articles, file
folders, and other materials found through searching with
STAR/Web. Web pages and input boxes used with STAR/Web
maintain their state while the user views the initial results
of the search. When users select a hypertext link,
conventional search engines immediately forget what the user
entered as search text. As STAR/Web users move from searching
to displaying results, displaying linked files, or selecting
terms from an index display for automatic pasting, STAR/Web
tracks and remembers what the user has entered and selected-to
provide a true interactive retrieval model.

Eliminates HTML programing staff and time

STAR/Web minimizes the overhead in becoming a Web host by
using information already organized in the main
database-whether it is descriptions of items in a collection,
or the full text of documents. And, STAR/Web takes the hassle
out of designing and managing many Web pages for large
collections because it does the translation into HTML
specifications.

"The system administrator uses STAR to set up one or many
assisted searches. These are translated by STAR/Web into
complete HTML specifications (e.g., using table formats and
other sophisticated HTML conventions). Standard STAR reports,
for sorting and presenting users' search results in many
different ways-with online images and hypertext are easily
deaned in STAR as HTML documents. With STAR and STAR/Web, our
sites are up and running fast, with high-quality services
operating in a totally standard Web environment," said Judith
Wanger, vice president of Cuadra Associates, Inc.

Pricing for the STAR/Web option depends on the number of
simultaneous users to be supported. For the typical STAR
system, STAR/Web adds about $240 per simultaneous user to the
system price.  STAR/Web requires STAR, the highly acclaimed
Unix-based software for managing, accessing and presenting all
types of information from corporate and other institutional
databases.

1390.

"ENTREPRENEURAL LIBRARIANSHIP" PROVIDES ESSENTIAL
READING FOR LIBRARY AND INFO SERVICES PROFESSIONALS

Like so many other modern businesses, library management has
entered a new era of accountability.  Libraries must now be
run in much the same way as a successful corporation, with a
focus on responsibility, performance and control. For some
librarians and information managers, this can represent a
dramatic change from the traditional library setting.

But naming an effective, cost-efficient library need not be an
overwhelming task. The same management methods that work for
other businesses can easily be implemented in the library
setting as well.

NEW VOLUME PROVIDES CLEAR AND CONCISE
GUIDELINES AND TECHNIQUES

A new handbook from Bowker-Saur -- "Entrepreneurial
Librarianship: The Key to Effective Information Management,"
by Guy St. Clair -- applies contemporary management and
business techniques to the fields of library science and
information services. Written specifically for this field, the
volume gives users timely management theory they can use to
improve customer service, establish an entrepreneurial
management environment, develop power and influence within an
organization, and improve the quality of the services they
provide.

Entrepreneurial Librarianship offers practical techniques for
creating an entrepreneurial environment in a library or
information services organization, and provides ideas for
initiating such techniques where a less successful operation
is already in place. Specific topics include taking risks,
cultivating teamwork, and displaying leadership.

This definitive guidebook enables library professionals to:

* define entrepreneurial management.

* convince those who are resistant to change.

* adapt the characteristics of successful businesses to the
library setting.

For more information, call 800-521-8110.

PIONEER-STANDARD ELECTRONICS, INC. JOINS INTERNET COMMUNITY

Customers, Suppliers and Investors Gain Access to the Latest
Information on Company Products, Services, and Financials.

Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PIOS), a leading
North American distributor of industrial electronic
components, computers and peripheral equipment, has added a
new tool to help customers and suppliers get immediate access
to the information they need -- a home page on The Internet's
World Wide Web (http://www.pios.com).

"We designed our home page to act as an inviting and easy to
use electronic magazine," says Art Rhein, Senior Vice
President of Sales and Marketing. "It includes headline
stories, colorful maps, and a table of contents that provides
a sneak preview of what's inside. Like a magazine, it changes
monthly, but unlike one, you can click on a map, a headline or
a menu item to immediately jump to where you want to go."

Customers can click on a map of Pioneer's 53 offices to find a
contact name, address, phone or fax number. Other hot-button
items take the user to a graphically rich menu of company
products and services; electronic versions of full-color sales
brochures and collateral. News stories about Pioneer as well
as press releases and copies of annual and quarterly reports
are also one click away.

Pioneer's web site is also inter-active. E-mail messages can
be forwarded to any Pioneer employee through the Internet. The
home page also reaches far beyond Pioneer itself. From its
listing of current suppliers and products, users can click on
the listed company to reach that company's home page, if one
exists.

Other enhancements to Pioneer's web site are in the works.

Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., and its 50% owned
affiliate, Pioneer Technologies group, Inc. is a
billion-dollar plus systems solutions company with more than
50 sales and technical offices throughout North America.

ELECTRONIC MARKETING WILL GENERATE
$230 BILLION OF SALES BY 2000

Electronic Media to Gain Acceptance as Security Concerns are
Resolved

Worldwide sales of goods and services through CD-ROM catalogs,
on-line storefronts and Internet malls will grow from $700
million in 1995 to $230 billion by 2000, a compound annual
growth rate of more than 200%, according to INPUT, the
information technology market intelligence firm.  Although a
large portion of the current sales occur through the shopping
areas of on-line services such as Prodigy and CompuServe, most
of the growth will be through Internet's World Wide Web.

Steve Young, Manager of INPUT's Electronic Commerce Program,
says: "The explosive growth in sales is good news for those
pioneer companies currently marketing through these electronic
media, many of which are learning hard lessons about the
difficulty of getting customers to change their behavior and
accept the use of technology in the buying process."

INPUT research finds that these barriers are about to break
down as confidence builds that network security, including
transaction privacy and trading partner authentication can be
attained. Netscape Communications, Enterprise Integration
Technology, Teisa Systems and RSA Data Security, are leading
providers of security technology, and notwithstanding the
recent rash of negative publicity, they have the capability to
offer a secure environment. As user acceptance increases, a
business infrastructure is developing to support electronic
marketing. This includes the electronic "landlords" (such as
marketplaceMCI), Internet Service Providers (such as Netcom),
software vendors (such as Netscape), system integrators (such
as Andersen Consulting), and advertising services (such as
Ogilvy & Mather).

GLOBAL ACCESS LAUNCHES SINGAPORE OFFICE

As part of its continuing commitment to international
expansion, Global Access Telecommunications Services, Inc., a
leading provider of worldwide satellite and fiber transmission
services for the television and video industry, has opened its
Singapore office.  Global Access' Singapore subsidiary, Global
Satellite and Video Services (Asia) Pte Ltd., headed by Simon
Patch, director of brainess development, Asia Pacific, will
coordinate business for the entire Asia Pacific region.

The newest Global Access office, headquartered in Singapore's
New Tech Park, will be providing broadcast services for a
number of significant customers in the Asia Pacific region,
including ESPN in SingVore, STAR-TV in Hong Kong, and Fuji
Television and Nippon Television in Tokyo. In delivering
satellite transmission services to the Asia Pacific market,
Global Access draws upon 13 years of experience in providing
satellite and fiber broadcast services worldwide.

"As the Asia Pacific broadcast television market explodes,
Global Access is poised to build on the satellite services we
have been providing the region for years," said Jack Morse,
president and CEO of Global Access. "We have experienced staff
with intimate knowledge of the local broadcast market and
issues, and our multilingual Singapore operations center is
seamlessly integrated into our U.S. and U.K. offices. With the
leadership of Simon Patch, we can provide our Asia Pacific
clients with around-the-clock, around-the-world services."

Patch, who brings more than 26 years of experience in the
telecommunications industry to the position of business
development director, has also served as a vice president at
Keystone Communications and business director for Visnews.
Global Access' Singapore-based staff also includes Denise
Lekowski, international services coordinator. Lekowski, most
recently international liaison for Keystone Communications,
brings to the new operation years of expertise in the local
and international market. In addition to its local staff,
Global Access' Boston-based Keith Buckley, vice president,
sales, and Robert McNamara, director, international
operations, will put their combined industry and market
expertise to work for the Singapore operation.

Global Access' expansion into the Asia Pacific arena coincides
with the company's fast-paced European growth. Earlier this
year, Global Access acquired Business Television Services Ltd.
(BTS), a U.K.-based provider of business television and
special event services. BTS, now known as Global Access
Telecommunications Services Ltd., has been fully integrated
into Global Access' European operation, which offers both
business services to major corporations and broadcast services
for news, sports, and special events.

SMARTS INTRODUCES INTERNET SERVICES MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

Self-Managing Internet Software From System Management ARTS

Pity no more the beleaguered Internet Administrator; novice or
professional. Totally automated, self-managing Internet server
and service administration is here.

The first public demonstrations of a unique software package,
"InCharge For The Internet" created by System Management ARTS
(SMARTS), White Plains, NY, took place during the E-Mail World
& Internet Expo, in Boston.

InCharge employs company developed, "Management by
Delegation" and "Codebook Event Correlation" (patent pending),
for creating automated management products that use familiar

ALISAMAIL SOLVES E-MAIL INCOMPATABILITY

Corporate America's growing dependence on E-mail to facilitate
high speed communication in the workplace, and the use of
different platforms to perform different tasks has given rise
to a new problem: Multiple, incompatible E-mail systems that
cannot communicate with each other. With fast, reliable and
cost-effective communication being essential to maintaining a
competitive edge in today's global marketplace, the inability
to communicate with clients, vendors, distributors, and other
employees can hinder growth and stifle profits.

with increasing frequency, companies are finding that they
have a mix of E-mail programs that don't communicate with each
other installed on PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations and
legacy mainframes. When E-mail systems can't communicate with
each other, savings gained by effective communications cannot
be realized.

At some point, senior management wakes up to the fact that in
the "paperless office", corporate-wide E-mail is essential.
The task of integration is usually assigned to the corporate
Information Systems (IS) group who are faced with the
challenge of integrating the various existing departmental
E-mail systems.

This is a complicated task that involves making systems
interoperate, share directory information and documents across
different platforms.

This does not mean, however, that a standardized,
corporate-wide E-mail system needs to be purchased. Mail
integration technology is widely used to connect disparate
systems. The numerous benefits of integrating existing systems
make the concept a sensible alternative.

First, businesses preserve their initial investment. This
investment is not limited to the cost of the original E-mail
system packages, but includes the cost of servers needed to
run the system and the training of users.

These users often have limited computer experience and are
reluctant to give up their favorite E-mail system after
spending hours getting accustomed to its features and
capabilities. By switching E-mail systems in an effort to
standardize, users are taken out of their friendly computer
environment and placed into an unknown one.

Mail integration software solves this problem by allowing
users to seamlessly communicate with a variety of other mail
systems in a "friendly" manner. The address and message is
'switched" to make it appear as if users are communicating
with a computer on their very same E-mail system!

Second, mail integration can buy a company time to implement
an enterprise-wide migration strategy to wean users off older
legacy based mainframe systems and prepare them for a
standard-based information system. Additional benefits depend
on the particular features offered by the mail integration
software they select.

The technological demands of integration are extensive.
Choosing a mail integrator requires a careful examination of
features, benefits and reputation. Integration vendors
approach the issue differently and the results differ. Alisa
Systems has long been an industry leader in mail systems
integration. They have a reputation for being the best in the
business according to high tech computer publications and
other independent sources whose job it was to compare
integration systems.

Alisa offers a complete mail integration package called
AlisaMail. AlisaMail is a full-featured E-mail switch that
interconnects the most popular LAN-based electronic mail
systems. It provides seamless and transparent exchange of
electronic messages, fully editable documents and binary files
between WordPerfect GroupWise, Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail,
CE Software QuickMail, X.400, SMTP and Digital VMSmail,
ALL-IN-1 and Message Router. This includes spread sheets, word
processing documents, graphic and binary files. Most
importantly, AlisaMail is built on a relational database,
Sybase, that makes the system extremely flexible. "The really
strong point of the system is it's easy to customize how
information is presented." said Don Cole, president of Alisa
Systems.

The OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory Synchronization and
Message Switch are the strengths of the system and separate
AlisaMail from the competition.

The OpenDirectory is implemented using a Sybase SQL relational
database and can be used as a corporate directory service.
OpenDirectory, a unique AlisaMail feature, eliminates
complicated addressing schemes by maintaining a common address
book synchronized with each mail system.

This "master" directory can include an address book of
customers, employees and vendors that contains information
such as their title, organization, department name, E-mail and
postal address, telephone and FAX number, as well as a
photograph. The OpenDirectory provides a centralized address
book for all the E-mail users in their company. It is accessed
by either the user's E-mail client or an Alisa client/server
application called PeopleFinder.

PeopleFinder supports quick and easy on-line searching of the
AlisaMail Open Directory. Users may search specific fields in
the database such as Name, Title, Organization and Location.
Available for Windows, Macintosh and DEC VMS, PeopleFinder
allows users to browse the OpenDirectory and its contents to
display information not accessable in the user's address book.

Existing desktop client/server development tools and
applications can also be used to access the OpenDirectory.
With Sybases's openserver technology you can even connect to
other corporate databases.

Auto Directory Synchronization works hand in hand with the
OpenDirectory and is the key to mail systems integration.
Without Auto Directory Synchronization, the Open Directory
would be useless. Open Directory creates and maintains a
master directory of all E-mail users in by requesting
directory updates from each separate mail system. When changes
are made in one E-mail system such as adding, modifying or
deleting an E-mail address, the information is then
transferred to the master directory and then used to update
all the other directories.

In medium to large companies where there can be many changes,
AlisaMail allows the updating to be performed automatically.
The superior performance of our Auto Directory Synchronization
is made possible by the flexibility of the SQL database. "In
essence, AlisaMail makes each mail system's directory an
aggregate of all the users. It represents the entire
population and there is no distinction in where these people
live." said Cole.

AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects the
different E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.

The gateway and Message Switch act as a store-and-forward
message hub and also handle the conversion of message formats
as required by the E-mail systems. The Message Switch
preserves the functionality of each mail system because it
stores the message in its unaltered format. The format of the
message is then converted only if the recipient mail system
requires conversion. If the receiving mail system does not
support all the functionality of the sender's, the Message
Switch will preserve as much functionality as possible.

Alisa Systems takes full responsibility for the success of
your E-mail integration. Alisa Systems will conduct on-site
surveys to determine your specific mail integration needs and
provide a customized solution. They will even install
AlisaMail on site for you, train you and help you fine-tune
the system to maximize performance in your environment.

"There's lots of bits and places for information to be stored
in a corporation and people need access to it," says Cole,
"There is a technology out there that can help you run your
business and save money."

Aspen Developing
New Electrocatalysts

Aspen Systems Inc. (184 Cedar Hill St., Marlborough, MA 01752-3017;
Tel: 508/481-5058) has been awarded a $74,998 Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 grant from the Department of
Energy (DOE) for the development of low-cost, contamination-
tolerant electrocatalysts for low-temperature fuel cells.  Aspens
Kang P. Lee says that power generation from fuel cells via reformed
gaseous fuel or direct methanol oxidation is a very attractive
option for fuel-cell vehicles or other mobile systems.  One of the
major problems with the technology, though, is the high cost and
limited supply of noble metal-based catalysts.  Such catalysts are
prone to carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide poisoning.

Metal carbides, such as molybdenum carbide and tungsten carbide,
exhibit high catalytic activity toward the electro-oxidation of
methanol.  Such catalysts are also tolerant of carbon monoxide
contamination in the reaction zone.  The problem is that it is very
difficult to manufacture these materials with high surface areas.
Expensive high-temperature reduction and carbonization techniques
or high-energy processes such as ion implantation are used to
prepare high surface area metal carbides.

The Aspen approach is to manufacture Group VI metal carbides using
nonconventional, proprietary surfactants in a chemical reduction
process.  Methods for controlling the composition, morphology, and
particle size of the materials will be developed with the Phase 1
SBIR grant.  The products will then be evaluated with respect to
surface area, particle size, particle morphology, size
distribution, composition, crystallinity, the presence of impurity
phases, and localized electronic energy levels at the surface.
Their electrocatalytic activity of these nanoscale metal carbides
will be investigated for their effect on hydrogen and methanol
oxidation.

Grant Funds a
Catalyst/Collector

An integrated catalyst/collector structure for regenerative proton-
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells is the subject of a $75,000
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 grant from the
Department of Energy (DOE) to Giner Inc. (14 Spring St., Waltham,
MA 02154-4497; Tel: 617/899-7270).

Tony LaConti says that dedicated PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, and
regenerative fuel cells offer benefits to the electric vehicle (EV)
industry and energy-storage programs.  The Giner researchers will
construct a new gas-diffusion electrode/current collection
interface (GCI) structure that they believe will yield superior
performance, stability, and simplicity at the positive electrode of
PEM electrochemical cells.

The Giner structure is based on a stabilized, proprietary metal
sinter that provides PEM fuel cell catalytic activity and
facilitates bulk fluid distribution.  LaConti anticipates improved
bifunctional performance at the positive electrode and similar
construction of both the GCI and bipolar plate, leading to reduced
complexity of the system and increased feasibility of single-unit
PEM regenerative fuel cells.

The GCI structure should be applicable to dedicated fuel cells and
electrolyzers, providing improved performance, simplicity, and
reliability.  Electrolyzers could supply high-pressure hydrogen to
hydrogen-air PEM fuel cells.  PEM regenerative fuel-cell
applications could be particularly important in the future
development of energy storage or load leveling based on solar
energy photovoltaic conversion systems and other advanced low-cost
energy concepts, e.g. wind power.

Improved Molten
Carbonate Matrix

A process discovered by Katsumi Suzuki and a team of scientists at
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (Research Institute,
Fuel Cell Development Dept., 301-15 Toyosu, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135,
Japan) is used to fabricate a porous matrix. The matrix consists of
a thin-plate of lithium aluminate impregnated with alkali
carbonate.  It supports the liquid electrolyte in molten carbonate
fuel cells (MCFC), which need high efficiency and minimal
environmental pollution for in-city electric power generation.

Since mechanical integrity and chemical stability of the porous
electrolyte plate (matrix) affect the reliability and life of the
MCFC, Suzuki and his colleagues have applied the concept of fiber
reinforcements to the plate.  The application comes in the form of
lithium aluminate fibers composed of single rather than
polycrystals.  The single crystals yield more thermally stable
fibers with a high degree of chemical compatibility with molten
carbonate.  Adding the fibers to the electrolyte plate improves
thermal cycle resistance.  All of these characteristics make the
fibers more effective under MCFC operating conditions.

After considering various starting materials and synthesis methods
for the lithium aluminate fibers, the scientists settled on lithium
hydroxide and alumina hydroxide.  Since the effect of a third
component, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, was
unclear, it was eliminated. Additionally, they decided to develop
a new fabrication method based on the low-temperature chemical
reactions in aqueous solutions rather than the reaction
temperatures higher than 400oC commonly used.

In the Materials Research Society's Advances in Porous Materials
[371, 297-302, 1995], Suzuki's team described how it prepared an
aqueous slurry that contained 0.6% mole of lithium hydroxide and
0.6% mole of alumina hydroxide.  The slurry was heated at 50oC for
one hour, and then the temperature was raised to 95oC-99oC under
controlled conditions for about 200 hours, in order to evaporate
water from the slurry.  This process yielded a straight beta-
lithium aluminate fiber with a diameter of one micron and a length
of 10 to 15 microns.   An intermediate phase (about 25 hours into
the evaporation process) produces a complex hydroxide
[LiOH2Al(OH)3nH2)].

Sukuzi believes that the dehydration reaction proceeds between the
complex hydroxide the lithium hydroxide.  They found the formation
of the beta-lithium aluminate to be dependent on the water-
evaporation condition.  Additionally, by varying the molar ratio of
the starting materials, at low water evaporation rates, the
research team found varying levels of the complex hydroxide
present, even though the morphology of the fiber stayed basically
the same.

It was discovered that using a two-stage water-evaporation process
controlled crystal growth and changed the fiber's morphology.  The
second stage involved cooling the slurry to room temperature and
holding it for 24 hours, once half of the residual water in it was
evaporated.  This reaction produced a beta-lithium aluminate with
a larger diameter (3 microns) and longer length (30 microns) than
the original fiber.  The researchers surmised that the reaction
between the lithium hydroxide and the complex hydroxide caused the
original fiber to form the nucleus of the larger fiber.

Based on the knowledge that high temperatures (above 700oC) causes
beta-lithium aluminate to transform to gamma-lithium aluminate,
Suzuki et al experimented with temperatures ranging from 650oC to
950oC, in order to promote transformation.  They observed a
transformation at 800oC in 30 minutes and at 900oC in two minutes.
At both these temperatures, the gamma-lithium aluminate kept the
same fiber geometry as the beta-lithium aluminate.

To evaluate the effect that the gamma-lithium aluminate fiber
reinforcements had on the MCFC electrolyte plate's performance,
Suzuki et al added 10% of the fiber to an ordinary gamma-lithium
aluminate powder and dispersed the mixture in an organic solvent.
This solution formed the basis of a slurry for tape casting and
fabricating the electrolyte plate via the doctor blade method.

They tested 20 heat and cooling cycles, at temperatures ranging
from 350oC to 650oC, on a 10 cm square single cell that contained
the fiber-reinforced electrolyte plate.  Test conditions included
an average cell voltage of 0.75 V and a current density of 150
mA/cm2, levels that matched a comparable cell without the fiber-
reinforced electrolyte plate. The research team noted no
significant gas cross-leakage during the cell testing for the
gamma-lithium aluminate-reinforced plate, while the ordinary plate
exhibit a 5% gas cross-leakage half way through the test cycles.
The fibers retained their original form and remained stable with
alkali carbonates and under MCFC test conditions.

Grant for Modeling
Molten Carbonate

Joseph D Fehribach, a researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
(100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2247; Tel: 617/793-5000)
has received a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant to
create mathematical models of molten carbonate fuel cells.
Fehribach says that the models used to describe molten carbonate
fuel cells are generally deficient in certain aspects. The aim of
the research is to develop and study improved mathematical models
for electrochemical fuel cells, particularly molten carbonate fuel
cells.

Fehribach added that these microscale potential models will be
analyzed numerically and analytically to determine what results can
be achieved on this small scale. The equations will be used to
derive consistent models in terms of species concentration. Both
types of models will be averaged to obtain macroscale models that
can be fit to experimental data.

A number of different averaging techniques will be considered in
formulating three-phase homogenized models to obtain a broad
prospective on the relationship between the microscale and the
macroscale. An important part of the work will be addressing
questions of interest to the fuel-cell research community and
comparing the models to experimental results.

Alliant's Product
First on Jupiter

High-power D-size lithium-sulfur dioxide batteries designed and
produced by Alliant Techsystems (5901 Lincoln Drive, Edina, MN
5536; Tel: 612/931-5413, Fax: 612/931-5423) recently provided power
for NASA's Galileo entry probe during its dramatic and apparently
successful descent into Jupiter's atmosphere.  The probe relayed
data and digitally stored photographs prior to its on-schedule
destruction deep in Jupiter's high-pressure atmosphere.

The probe was the first man-made object to enter the atmosphere of
an outer planet and although they were eventually destroyed along
with the probe, the Alliant batteries were the first batteries on
Jupiter.  The probe was designed and built by Hughes Space and
Communications Co., and was launched six years ago aboard the Space
Shuttle Atlantis.

According to Rod Bitz, director of corporate communications, the
specially space-qualified D-sized batteries are durable enough to
withstand the severe acceleration, vibration, and G forces the
Galileo probe encountered as it enters the Jovian atmosphere.  The
batteries underwent thorough pre-launch shelf-life and
qualification programs, special engineering tests, and have been
tested regularly throughout the six-year journey to Jupiter.

In 1997, Alliant's lithium batteries again will provide power for
a deep-space probe when the Cassini Saturn mission is launched on
an 11-year journey.  The spacecraft will release the Huygens probe
to inspect Titan, a satellite of Saturn and the only moon in the
solar system known to have an atmosphere.  Additional missions to
the outer planets, including Neptune and Pluto, are under
consideration.

Oak Ridge Design Is
Licensed to Teledyne

Doctors who rely on tests that monitor the brain activity of their
patients could benefit from a new battery developed at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (Oak Ridge, TN 37830-6030) and licensed to
Teledyne Electronic Technologies (TET).  The thin-film, solid-
state, rechargeable lithium battery may be used to amplify brain
impulses recorded during an electroencephalogram (EEG) procedure.


At present,  EEGs rely on sensors to detect the extremely low-level
electric signals coming from the body.  The signals are then
relayed through wires to an amplification device.  ORNL reports
that the new batteries may be used in performing electrocardiogram
(EKG) procedures and in other medical diagnostic tools.  Other
likely applications include portable communications devices, where
the devices could be integrated into the circuits; power sources
for personal hazardous gas sensors and micromachines; and backup
power sources for SRAM and DRAM memory.

The new battery, says John Bates (Tel: 423/574-6280, Fax: 423/574-
4143, E-mail: job@ornl.gov) of ORNL, offers many useful features,
particularly in applications requiring small size.  The ORNL device
is only 10 micrometers thick, can be manufactured in a variety of
shapes, and may be applied to virtually any solid substrate, such
as silicon, alumina, glass, and plastics.  When mounted on plastic
substrates, the batteries are quite flexible.

Experimental cells typically have areas of 0.5-2.0 cm2, but Bates
says that there is no fundamental limit the on areal dimensions.
The batteries have high energy densities, can be charged thousands
of times, and have a long shelf life with no measurable change
after one year of storage.  A wide operating temperature range is
another advantage of the devices; cycle testing at ORNL has been
performed between -20oC and +100oC.

The components of the new thin-film battery, including vanadium,
platinum, or nickel current collectors; a cathode; an electrolyte;
a lithium anode; and a multilayer parylene/metal protective
coating, are deposited on a substrate using standard sputtering or
evaporation techniques.  The performance characteristics of the
battery are determined by the type of cathode material, its area
and thickness, and the operating temperature.  The cathode
material, such as crystalline LiCoO2 or amorphous or crystalline
LiMn2O4 or V2O5, and the deposition and processing methods used to
prepare the cathode film determine the operating voltage range,
capacity, specific power, and specific energy.

Batteries with crystalline LiCoO2 cathodes, deposited by sputtering
and then annealed in oxygen at 600oC-700oC, have high discharge
rates with good cathode utilization and small capacity loss with
cycling.  Their disadvantage is the high annealing temperature
required to form the crystalline phase.  Crystalline LiMn2O4
cathodes are deposited by electron-beam evaporation or sputtering
and then annealed at 700oC-800oC.  They feature high discharge rates
of up to several milliamps per square centimeter (mA/cm2) at 25oC,
but also must be annealed to achieve the crystalline form.

Because the batteries are rechargeable, it is not necessary to
supply the power and energy required by a single duty cycle, i.e.
the conditions of current and operating time required by a device
before recharge can occur.  This means that the applications for
which recharging is an option, the batteries can be much smaller
than primary, or nonrechargable, cells designed for the same
application.  The device, which contains fewer toxic materials than
most other batteries, is the focus of a cooperative research and
development agreement (CRADA) involving ORNL and TET.

Chrysler, Post Office
Placing Horizon Orders

Electrosource Inc.  (3800 B Drossett Drive, Austin, TX 78744-1131;
Tel: 512/445-6606, Fax: 512/445-6819) has received a production
purchase order from Chrysler Corp.  for trademarked Horizon
advanced lead-acid EV batteries.  Michael G.  Semmens, chairman,
president, and CEO of Electrosource, says the order could result in
additional orders exceeding $80 million cumulatively over the next
three years.  The order provides cost and delivery terms for
battery packs that Chrysler will use in its new EPIC electric
minivan.

Semmens added, "The production purchase order provides the basis
for us to ramp up our manufacturing capacity to meet Chrysler's
production schedules." The order was announced at the EV and
Infrastructure Conference sponsored by the Electric Vehicle
Association of the Americas and co-sponsored by The Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI), an Electrosource strategic partner.
Chrysler plans to issue build orders to Electrosource against
production and delivery terms described in the PPO.

"Electrosource has met all of the technical requirements to qualify
the advanced Horizon battery for use in our electric minivans,"
said Robert Feldmaier, Chrysler executive engineer in charge of the
electric minivan program.  "We are on schedule with our program to
develop and produce the electric minivan."

Electrosource has received notice that Horizon batteries will be
used in 10 U.S.  Postal Service (USPS) vehicles in two U.S.  cities
slated for evaluation of electric postal vehicles.  Battery
Automated Transportation, International, and U.S.  Electricar each
selected Horizon batteries for use in five vehicles.

Responding to the U.S.  Energy Policy Act requiring an increasing
number of new fleet vehicles to use alternative fuels and the
California mandate for zero-emission vehicles, USPS Vice President
for Engineering William J.  Dowling says, "With our fleet of more
than 200,000 vehicles, it is imperative that we take a leadership
role in demonstrating our commitment to the goals of lower
emissions and energy independence.  Since postal delivery vans
operate with fixed, low-mileage daily routes that are usually
between 12-20 miles, they are excellent candidates for electric
propulsion."

With a majority of funding for the postal vehicle conversion
program coming from the U.S.  Department of Energy, the USPS plans
to convert a total of 25 postal service vehicles in five cities to
electric propulsion systems.  After one year of field testing in
the first phase, the USPS will evaluate the data on all 25 vehicles
to determine the best system.  The second phase of the USPS
conversion program could include conversions of many more mail
carrier vehicles across the nation.

ERC Revenues Up
on Fuel-Cell Activity

Fuel cell and nickel-zinc battery design company Energy Research
Corp.  (3 Great Pasture Road, Danbury, CT 06813; Tel: 203/792-1560,
Fax: 203/798-2945, E-mail: http://www.ercc.com) has reported that
revenues for the 1995 fiscal year increased 13% to $34 million,
compared with revenues of $30 million for the prior year. Bernard
S.  Baker, president and CEO, says the increase in revenues was due
to fuel-cell power-plant construction and test activities and
increased work under the company's various government contracts.

Net income doubled to $442,000 ($0.11 per share) compared with
$220,000 ($0.06 per share) for fiscal 1994.  Net income in the
fourth-quarter fiscal 1995 increased to $90,000 ($0.02 per share)
compared with $37,000 ($0.01 per share).  For the fourth quarter,
revenues decreased 25% to $7.8 million, compared with $10.3 million
in same quarter in the previous year.  Revenues during the quarter
were lower than last year due primarily to completion of
construction of the world's largest carbonate fuel-cell plant in
Santa Clara, CA.  Battery activity also advanced.

Baker told BET, "During 1995, we improved our patent position on
our proprietary nickel-zinc battery that we are developing for
various OEM applications such as laptop computers and other
portable devices.  We are continuing discussions with potential
partners relative to battery opportunities."

Baker also noted that the company was engaged in extensive pre-
testing of its project in Santa Clara, CA, during the fourth
quarter of 1995.  This activity is continuing into the first
quarter of 1996 in anticipation of plant start-up in the second
quarter.  First-quarter revenues this year are likely to be lower
because government contracts are operating under a continuing
resolution from Congress until there is a final budget agreement.


ERC has established a new Internet homepage available at
http://www.ercc.com.  The ERC homepage includes sections describing
the company's fuel-cell and battery technologies, financial
information, and recent news, as well as abstracts of technical
papers prepared by ERC engineers and scientists.  The homepage also
contains links to the home pages of ERC licensees, including AEG
Daimler-Benz, Sanyo Electric, and Mitsubishi Electric Corp., as
well as development partners, including the U.S.  DOE, the Fuel
Cell Commercialization Group, and EPRI.

CARB Mandate
Changes to ZEV

As predicted, the California Air Resources Board (2020 L St.,
Sacramento, CA 95814-4219; Tel: 916/322-2990) has directed its
staff to finalize a plan that would offer changes to the current
Zero Emission Vehicle or ZEV rule, scheduled for introduction in
1998.  The staff's preliminary proposal is to drop the 2%
requirement in the early years of the program and to ramp up to 10%
ZEVs by 2003, when all car companies that sell more than 3,000
vehicles per year statewide must comply with the regulation.

Manufacturers will receive extra ZEV credit though 2003 for EVs
sold before 1998 and those equipped with advanced battery types
that have the range and lifespan that many experts believe is
needed to make them competitive with gasoline-powered models.
Those battery types, including lithium and nickel-based designs,
are expected to be commercially available by 2001.

John Dunlap, CARB chairman, told BET, "This plan provides for a
successful launch of commercially viable electric cars that
protects public health and will provide new high-tech jobs in
California.   This plan promotes a market-based introduction of
ZEV's and will unleash the engineering and the marketing prowess of
automakers.  We have directed our staff to develop that plan and
present it to this board for our consideration at a public hearing
no later than March 1996."

The plan calls for development partnership through a Memorandum of
Agreement that meets the following criteria:

ZEVs should be placed in the Los Angeles and Sacramento basins in
the following volumes: 750 in 1998, 1500 in 1999, and 1500 in 2000
(without credits applied);
Manufacturers would commit to continued ZEV R&D, including the
purchase and evaluation of advanced battery prototypes prior to
1998;
A market incentive (extra ZEV credits) would be provided for
longer-range vehicles and early (pre-1998) vehicles.   Credits
retain full value through 2003;
State of California would purchase some advanced battery vehicles
each year;
Manufacturers would provide adequate materials for training
emergency-response personnel;
All vehicle manufacturer-supported media, publicity, and
legislative initiatives against the ZEV program would be converted
to media, publicity, and legislative initiatives in support of the
partnership and ZEVs;
Ongoing review process with annual reports by a committee of
signatories to include battery technology, market acceptance,
infrastructure, and incentives.  CARB biennial reviews continue
(i.e. 1998, 2000);
Review process to include discussion of product introduction plans
with CARB.
Ford Motor Co.  and Chrysler Corp.  told BET they still plan to
bring EVs to market in California by the 1998 model year despite
the state's decision to delay its electric car mandate by five
years.  Both companies said they were pleased that CARB wants to
ease the 1998 mandate, but they added that CARB's alternative
proposal has some shortcomings, namely that it moves up by a year,
to 2003, the deadline for 10% of vehicles sales being electric.

"We're happy because it's officially on record that the 1998 zero
emission mandate is unworkable,'' said Ford spokesman Howard
Hampton.  ``But there are still a lot of questions as to what they
actually said and did yesterday.  Nothing is set in stone." Eric
Ridenour, Chrysler's director for environmental and energy
planning, said a 10% mandate in 2003 will jeopardize the
development of advanced battery technologies.  "By moving the
required start date forward, we may preclude a fair chance at
getting some of these technologies into the mix. ''

EV advocates are predictably displeased with California's decision.
According to Tim Carmichael of the Coalition for Clean Air (Tel:
415/546-6656), the change in policy is believed to have been
directed by California Gov. Wilson.  He told BET, "We have seen no
scientific or technical reason to delay.  The agency responsible
for world-wide adoption of catalytic converters, unleaded gasoline,
and reformulated gasoline has never before buckled to political
pressure."

Melissa Kaznitz of CALPIRG (Tel: 805/564-1207) was displeased and
said, "This proposal represents the next step in the governor's
attempt to dismantle California's clean air plan.  He is selling
out the environment, high-tech business, and consumers to support
his generous patrons in the oil industry." The bottom line is that
the new plan would require only 3,750 ZEVs available between 1998
and 2000 versus 60,000 under the original proposal.  Roland Hwang
of the Union of Concerned Scientists (Tel: 510/543-1872) said the
plan was "inconsistent with the conclusions of the independent
battery panel that called for strong requirements beginning with
the year 2000 in order to maintain research and investment."

It is too soon to say for sure whether other states considering EV
mandates will follow suit, but EV advocates in New York and
Massachusetts are concerned.  Sonia Hamel, the director of air
policy for the state of Massachusetts, says Massachusetts Gov.
William Weld is "very disappointed." She fears that Massachusetts
and New York both are bound to follow California's ZEV program.
Hamel went on to point out that the abrupt 10% requirement in 2003
is not a "smart market launch." Jamie Phillips of the Planning and
Conservation League (Tel: 916/444-8726) added, "From zero to 10% is
a giant leap.  It requires a leap of faith in the car companies --
in whom we have little faith."

Chrysler Introduces
Epic Electric Minivan

Chrysler Corp.  (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland Park, MI 48288-
1899; Tel: 313/956-5657) introduced the "Epic" electric minivan at
the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas EV and
Infrastructure Conference in Atlanta, GA.  Robert Feldmaier,
executive engineer for Chrysler's electric minivan program told the
conference, "We see the Epic as the next logical step in the
development of electric vehicles."

The Epic, acronym for "Electric Powered Interurban Commuter," was
developed with Westinghouse and, as described in this issue of BET,
will initially offer the Electrosource Horizon advanced lead-acid
battery.  Chrysler has the ability to build the vehicle on-line at
its Windsor, Ontario, Assembly Plant as part of regular production.
No conversion is necessary.  The Epic model designation will be
applied to both Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager models that are
optioned with electric power.

Due to development and competitive reasons, the launch date for the
vehicle will not be released at this time.  Feldmaier explained,
"There are several final supplier issues that need to be worked
through, so we're not ready to give an exact launch date.  However,
we've made it clear that this vehicle would be available by the
1998 model year, and that has not changed." Feldmaier added that
demand for the vehicle will also be a factor in establishing a
launch target date.  Cost and range are the two critical market
issues that will shape fleet customer demand.

"Because the minivan is by far our most successful vehicle, and
because it has the unique ability to work as either a commuter
vehicle or a utility vehicle, this platform made the most sense to
us for electric power," he said.  "The large flat floor also gives
us plenty of room to store batteries, and more importantly, to
change battery types as new technologies are developed.  Right now
we're able to get 27 modules at about 1,600 pounds on board of the
advanced lead-acid battery.  We anticipate a range of about 60
miles under ideal conditions with that amount and type of battery."

Cost and price of the vehicle have not been finalized.  Feldmaier
said the low-volume componentry and the cost of batteries will make
the vehicle "significantly more costly than a comparable gasoline
minivan." However, as is the case with all Chrysler production
vehicle launches, pricing will not be announced until the release
date of the vehicle has been established.

The Epic will incorporate several unique customer features,
including a powermeter that gives the amount of power being drawn
by the driver to help optimize driving style to extend range.  The
vehicle will also feature anti-lock regenerative brakes and dual
airbags and will meet all federal safety regulations.

Chrysler will target many of the fleet and utility customers that
have previously purchased its electric and compressed natural gas
(CNG) vehicles.  "At this stage of development, EVs will obviously
have a very limited customer base," said Mike Clement, manager of
alternative fuel vehicle sales and marketing.  "We'll first target
those fuel providers that are required to buy alternative fuel
vehicles under the Energy Policy Act."

The Epic will feature an AC Induction Motor with 100 peak hp and 75
hp continuous, along with a single-speed, front-wheel-drive
transaxle.  The EV weighs 5900 lbs.  and can carry a payload of 800
lbs.  The wheelbase is 113 inches in length by 186.3 inches wide by
75.6 inches high, resulting in 68.5 inches in cargo space and 146.2
cubic feet capacity with the seats removed.  The Epic accelerates
from 0 to 60 mph in 16 seconds, has a top speed of 80 mph, and a
range of 60 miles (SAE J1634 cycle - no accessories).

Conductive Charging
Prototypes Displayed

Ford Motor Co. (The American Road, Dearborn, MI 48121; Tel:
313/322-3000) and Chrysler Corp. (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland
Park, MI 48288; Tel: 313/956-5741) have unveiled a prototype of a
conductive charging system that the two automakers will use for
their production model electric vehicles (EVs).

Working models of the prototypes will be built so that utilities
can begin planning for their installation.  By choosing conductive
charging, Ford and Chrysler have taken a step toward standardizing
a crucial part of the infrastructure necessary to support the
eventual commercialization of EVs.

With EV structure, the goal is to avoid the VHS-versus-Beta
problems we saw with early video tape technology, says John
Wallace, director - Electric Vehicle Programs at Ford.  By
choosing one standard system of charging, automakers will assist
utility companies responsible for the installation of the EV-
charging network.

The prototype charging system was built by SCI Systems Inc. (Box
1000, Huntsville, AL 35807; Tel: 205/882-4601), a contract
manufacturer of electronic assemblies and products.  The conductive
system includes a home connecting device, which controls and
manages power, and a plug said to be safe and easy to use in all
weather conditions.

We chose a conductive charging system for our production EVs for
numerous reasons, says Bob Davis, executive engineer - Chrysler
Electric Vehicles.  We believe conductive charging is safe and the
most efficient and cost effective method of charging available.
Also, it is well understood by professional electricians and
requires no special tools, expensive diagnostic equipment, or
specialized training for widespread installation.

Conductive charging, the traditional method of connecting
electrical equipment to power sources, uses mating contacts to
transfer the electricity.  Home electric clothes dryers, with their
specially designed mating plugs, use conductive connections.  Like
them, EVs will use a unique--yet standardized--plug.  SCI
engineered the prototype system to the specifications of Chrysler,
Ford, five other automobile manufacturers, electric utilities, and
the California Air Resources Board (CARB).

The parties have been working together as part of the
Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) sponsored by the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI).  The IWC was formed in 1991 to
help develop an infrastructure that will allow EV owners to safely
and conveniently plug into charging stations at their homes and
other locations.  These infrastructure products will serve as the
basis for standards under development by the Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE) and will be proposed as international standards.

SatCon Develops Award-
Winning Technology

SatCon Technology Corp. (161 First St., Cambridge, MA 02142-1221;
Tel: 617/661-0540, Fax: 617/661-3373) is applying its award-winning
flywheel technology to the development of a drivetrain for
Chrysler's innovative, high-speed, hybrid electric race car, the
Patriot.  The car will serve as a "laboratory on wheels" for
advanced developments that could be part of future commercial
vehicles.  Now undergoing testing, the Patriot race car could top
200 miles per hour.

Winner of the Discover Award, SatCon's advanced hybrid electric
race car drivetrain consists of the following components:  a gas
turbine engine, a compact turboalternator unit (TAU), a carbon-
fiber flywheel, an electric traction motor/generator, and a
controller.  An efficient onboard fuel-burning (liquified natural
gas) turbine with a high power-to-weight ratio generates one-half
of a megawatt of electricity.  Power storage and load-leveling
takes place in a high-speed flywheel, which spins at 58,300 rpm.
The wheels are driven by the world's most powerful electric motor
for its size.  The one-foot in diameter motor produces more than
500 horsepower and allows regenerative braking.

The flywheel provides energy to power the traction motor and
augments the reduced-sized (about the size of a shoebox) TAU. The
TAU integrates a high-speed gas turbine with an efficient, high-
frequency AC induction and alternator in a two-spool arrangement on
each shaft.  Each spool generates 185 kW.  The power controller
weighs less than 100 pounds and handles enough current to power 200
homes.

Patriot's flywheel readily accepts regenerated braking energy
during deceleration and quickly charges, cycles, and releases that
energy as the car accelerates.  Custom-designed magnetic bearings
and a vacuum seal eliminate friction and drag losses, enabling the
flywheel to release nearly 90% of the energy it absorbs during
deceleration.

During races, technicians will rev the Patriot's flywheel up to
60,000 rpm, thereby providing enough energy for fast acceleration
as the race begins. The flywheel provides engine optimization by
enabling the combustion engine to run at a constant rate, thereby
saving energy.  In an all-electric vehicle, the flywheel can double
the range of the vehicle and extend the life of the battery pack.

SatCon will soon apply versions of the primary components of the
Patriot drivetrain to the following applications:

The advanced flywheel will serve as a source of "bridging power"
and power conditioning for commercial utility and residential
applications.
The compact turboalternator will provide a very high output,
portable power supply for heavy construction and military use, as
well as prime power for heavy equipment.
The ultra-high-output electric motor will be used to create quiet,
compact, but powerful air conditioning and chilling systems that
are 25% more energy efficient than those in use today.
The compact high-density controller is a key component for a new
generation of intelligent electromechanical products.

These SatCon components make use of advanced technologies
originally developed for defense and aerospace purposes.  SatCon's
flywheels started as energy storage and positioning systems for
orbiting satellites.  The turboalternator that converts the output
of the turbine engine into electric current was developed as a
stationary power source for the Army.  The steel in the ultra-high
output electric motor was developed for a weapons system.

SatCon's Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) system consists of a high-
speed flywheel, a motor/generator, a bearing support system, and a
containment/vacuum housing.  Power and control electronics
efficiently shuttle electrical energy in and out of the flywheel.
Whether in a vehicle or in stationary applications, the firm's FES
systems offer a variety of benefits, including low losses and
efficient operation, long life, safe operation and easy disposal,
braking energy recovery, and electric or hybrid vehicle
improvements.

For space applications, SatCon supplies the FES systems to NASA for
momentum recovery and spacecraft attitude control.  The firm's
innovative integrated Power and Attitude Control System combines
energy storage and spacecraft-control functions in a single FES
system.

For utility applications, SatCon's FES systems provide continuous
electrical power to critical machines and operations during
lighting strikes and other utility line faults.  FES systems can
solve quality problems caused by modern, high-frequency switching
power supplies.  Also, FES systems provide off-peak storage options
for reducing power-generation requirements to meet peak power
demands.

The company is developing a lightweight flywheel, uninterrupted
power supply for the Marine Corps.  This system will prevent
irregularities in voltage and frequency that could result in power
failure or the interruption of critical processes.

Flywheel Powers
Ford Concept Car

The new Ford Motor Co.  (14310 Hamilton Ave., Highland Park, MI
48203; Tel: 800/258-3835) Synergy 2010 is a hybrid EV developed as
a concept car to explore futuristic alternatives that could
theoretically triple the fuel efficiency of a typical family sedan.


At the vehicle's recent roll-out, Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and
chief executive officer, disclosed that the Synergy 2010 is powered
by a small, 1.0-liter direct-injection, compression-ignited engine
mounted in the rear that would power a generator that produces
electricity for motors located in each wheel.  Up front, a flywheel
collects excess engine and braking energy, which in turn would be
released to augment the engine when, for example, the car needed to
accelerate quickly or climb hills.

Bob Mull, director of Ford's New Generation Vehicle program, says
that in a direct-injection, compression-ignited engine, high
pressure or heat is used instead of spark plugs to ignite the fuel,
resulting in higher efficiency.  Theoretically, the Synergy 2010's
performance with this smaller engine would be comparable to today's
mid-sized family sedan because of its decreased weight, improved
aerodynamics and lower rolling resistance.

Although not mass buildable at this time, Trotman says, "Synergy
2010 is a good example of the kind of quantum leap, breakthrough
thinking we're encouraging in our new global alignment."

Duracell and Eveready
Include Charge Testers

Both Eveready (Checkerboard Square, St. Louis, MO 63164; Tel:
800/323-8177) and Duracell International Inc.  (Berkshire
Industrial Park, Bethel, CT 06801; Tel: 203/796-4000 or 800/422-
9001, Fax: 203/791-3273)  have announced plans to introduce
proprietary manganese-zinc alkaline batteries that incorporate
real-time charge testers.

In an interesting legal situation that will keep patent attorneys
occupied until the matter is definitively settled, both companies
claim to control valid patents for the same technology.
Spokespeople for both companies are claiming to be the "first" to
introduce these testers, with roll-out dates scheduled for first-
quarter 1996.

Eveready made the first announcement when Vice President of
Marketing David Hatfield proclaimed that the company would
introduce "the first on-battery tester," which he promises will
"jolt the consumer electronics industry by enabling users to test
the power of their Energizer brand batteries at any time for
unprecedented confidence in battery-operated products and
appliances." He added that the new Energizer on-battery tester will
be rolled out worldwide beginning with a U.S.  introduction in the
spring of 1996.  The tester was originally developed and patented
by Strategic Electronics (Reno, NV).

The Energizer on-battery tester will be available on AA, C, and D
cell sizes.  Like the Duracell tester, it utilizes thermochromic
technology that measures the amount of power in a battery based on
the amount of heat generated in the tester.  A consumer simply
presses both green dots firmly for 10 seconds.  At full power, the
word "GOOD" appears in the tester window.  When the tester stays
completely black, less than 25 percent of the power is remaining.


According to Hatfield, research indicates that 95% of consumers
prefer the convenience of the Energizer on-battery tester over
testers incorporated into the packaging.  With the on-battery
tester, consumers can check the power on the spot anytime, anywhere
-- without having to store or carry anything.  The new Energizer
way eliminates the clutter and hassle of having to store on-package
testers.  Moreover, 94% of consumers liked the idea after they
tried it, and nearly all (97%) said they'd recommend it to friends.

"Our research indicates consumers want to be able to determine
whether or not their batteries are good without the hassle of
having to save the packaging," said Hatfield.  "With the Energizer
on-battery tester, they'll never be caught off-guard in guessing
the state of batteries in their cameras, toys, portable cassette
players, or other frequently used electronic devices."

Energizer says that the U.S.  launch of the new Energizer on-
battery tester will be supported with an aggressive television and
print advertising campaign, as well as in-store promotion and
merchandising.  The convenience of the new product will be touted
through a national television campaign.

After Eveready's announcement, Duracell immediately responded with
its own declaration claiming what the company calls "the world's
first alkaline battery with a fuel-gauge-like power tester."
According to Duracell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles
R.  Perrin, the new trademarked line of PowerCheck Batteries allow
consumers to determine a battery's power anytime, anywhere.
Specifically, PowerCheck Batteries will be rolled out worldwide,
beginning with a launch of AA-sizes in the U.S. in the late spring
of 1996.  Availability in Canada and Europe will follow in the
summer of 1996, and PowerCheck Batteries will be sold in AAA, C,
and D sizes in early 1997.

Like the Eveready system, PowerCheck Batteries feature a fuel-
gauge-like tester located directly on the battery.  To activate the
tester, consumers press the dots on the side and bottom edge of the
battery.  A yellow thermochromic indicator measures heat resistance
in the cell and provides an easy-to-read indication of remaining
battery power.  When remaining battery power is sufficient, the
display rises into the "Good" zone on the indicator.  When
remaining battery power is insufficient, the display remains in the
"Replace" zone.  Perrin says that the launch of the PowerCheck
Batteries will be supported with new advertising and strong in-
store promotional activities.

The tester is the result of a joint venture between Duracell and
Avery Dennison Corp.  Charles D.  Miller, chairman and chief
executive officer of Avery Dennison, says this strategic alliance
was established two years ago.  Duracell licensed the original
technology from Eastman Kodak Co..  Kodak was awarded at patent for
the technology in 1991 (about the same time as Strategic Alliance)
in what was probably an error by the patent office.

In fiscal 1995, Eveready shipped almost 1.5 billion alkaline
batteries in North America alone and sold more than 6 billion
batteries in 160 countries.

Benchmarq Files
Chip Patent Suit

Semiconductor manufacturer Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc.  (2611
Westgrove Drive, Suite 109, Carrollton, TX 75006; Tel: 214/407-
9845) has filed a lawsuit against Dallas Semiconductor Corp.  (4401
S. Beltwood Parkway, Dallas, TX 75244-3292) in the Federal District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division.

In that lawsuit, Benchmarq is seeking a declaratory judgment that
certain of the company's products, including its bq2010/Battery
Management Product, bq4287/Real Time Clock Module, bq2201/Non-
Volatile Static Random Access Memory Controller Product, and
certain related products, do not infringe upon various patents held
by Dallas Semiconductor.

Derrell C.  Coker, Benchmarq's president, says the company filed
its lawsuit in response to allegations by Dallas Semiconductor that
Benchmarq's products may infringe upon various patents held by
Dallas Semiconductor.  Coker added, "In its product-development
efforts, Benchmarq has always attempted to ensure that its products
do not infringe upon the patents of any party and intends to
vigorously defend its products against this type of claim." With
this in mind, "Benchmarq felt that it had to act forcefully to
defend the integrity of its product-development effort."

Benchmarq designs, develops, and markets mixed-signal (analog and
digital) integrated circuits and electronic modules for portable
and power-sensitive electronic systems.  Benchmarq's battery
management integrated circuits and modules control fast-charging,
conditioning, and monitoring of rechargeable batteries, principally
for portable electronic systems, including personal computers,
cellular telephones, camcorders, power tools, shavers, and
electronic games.

Dueling Charging
Standards Created

Ford Motor Co.  (14310 Hamilton Ave., Highland Park, MI 48203; Tel:
313/390-2310) and Chrysler Corp.  (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland
Park, MI 48288-1899; Tel: 313/956-5657) has selected conductive
charging for their "standard" EV refueling technique.  Ford
director of Vehicle Programs John Wallace told said that,  "With EV
infrastructure, the goal is to avoid the VHS-versus-Beta problems
we saw with early videotape technology.  By choosing one standard
system of charging, automakers will assist utility companies
responsible for the installation of the EV charging network."
Unfortunately, this decision is actually a step backwards for EV
infrastructure standardization and creates precisely the kind of
VHS/Beta situation Wallace says he is trying to avoid.

This is because GM and its subsidiary Hughes (432 N. Saginaw St.,
Suite 801, Flint, MI 48502; Tel: 800-253-5328), with the support of
the Department of Energy and the public utilities' research
consortium Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), have already
picked inductive charging as an EV "standard." Conductive charging,
which is currently used by most EVs, depends on a direct conductor-
to-conductor contact between the electrical power source, the
charger's rectifier(s), and the EV's battery.  GM's charging uses
a non-conductive inductive connection between the power source and
the battery.

Which system is "better?" Conductive charging is less expensive (on
the order of $1,000 for a single vehicle system, versus on the
order of $2,000 for an inductive system).  Inductive charging is
faster (at least twice as fast, and if properly configured, much
faster).  Inductive charging is theoretically not as efficient as
conductive charging.  However, in practice, both systems are about
equally efficient.  Inductive systems (which use plastic, as
opposed to metal parts) weigh less.  Inductive systems may be safer
than conductive systems, especially if charging takes place outside
in the rain.  GM and EPRI cite this as a pivotal advantage.  Ford
says conductive systems can be made just as safe as inductive
systems.

The real answer to the Ford/Chrysler decision may be due to
marketing considerations.  The system they selected is available in
prototype form as the "home connecting device" from SCI Systems
(2101 Clinton Ave., Huntsville, AL 35805; Tel: 205/882-4800), an
established electronics and avionics design and manufacturing
company and a rival of GM's Hughes subsidiary in the aerospace and
other electronics markets.

SCI, like Hughes, is a member of the Department of Energy's EV
Infrastructure Working Council (IWC), but it was a relative
latecomer to the EV infrastructure business.  The Department of
Energy, via EPRI, has been promoting inductive charging as the best
bet for EV applications since the late 80s.  This attitude had all
but assured that GM and Hughes, which control key inductive-
charging technology, would come to dominate the EV charging
infrastructure.

It was only recently, and with a considerable amount of reluctance,
that EPRI has expanded its view to encompass the possibility of
widespread conductive EV charging.  Even if the wide use of EVs is
delayed, the decision is of more than academic interest.  Whether
it happens in five years or 20 years, the creation of an EV-
charging infrastructure will require billions of dollars of
capital.

TRP'S FINALE: 34 PROJECTS WIN $137 MILLION FOR DUAL-USE R&D

By:
Bill Loveless

   The Technology Reinvestment Project closed out 1995 by announcing its
final batch of awards -- 34 projects in dual-use technology that will
receive $137.4 million in government funding.
   The selections, whose announcement had been delayed until Congress and
the Clinton administration agreed on an appropriations bill for the
Department of Defense in FY-96, were the last for TRP as it has been known
since 1993.
   (A list of the projects is on pages 7-8.)
The program is being overhauled by Defense to respond to congressional
demands that the Pentagon pay stricter attention to military needs in
providing support for technologies with both defense and commercial
applications.
   When FY-97 begins in October, the Pentagon plans to have in place a new
name and a new office for dual-use technology (FTR, 21 Dec, 3).
   A $195 million allocation for TRP in the Pentagon's FY-96 appropriation
is sufficient only to support the program's 131 current projects, including
the most recent ones. It does not allow for any solicitations.
   DOD plans to request $300 million for the program in FY-97, when the new
Joint Dual-Use Program Office opens. The new office will be operated for a
year by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has managed TRP since
its inception, and then by the Pentagon's defense research and engineering
office.
   The latest projects, whose selections were announced Dec. 22, were among
140 proposals received last summer by ARPA and fell into six ``focus
areas,'' including affordable advanced controls, biological sensing,
digital wireless communications, microelectromechanical systems and
non-warfare technologies.
   The $137.4 million in government funding that will support the new
projects for a year is less than half the estimated total cost of the
projects, the Pentagon said.
   The largest project -- in the affordable advanced controls category --
is a $48 million effort led by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, St. Louis, to
build a vehicle-management system.
   A number of federal laboratories are participants in the projects,
including the Naval Surface Warfare Centers in Bethesda, Md., and Dahlgren,
Va.; the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.; the Air
Force's Rome Laboratory, Rome, N.Y., and Wright Laboratory, Dayton, Ohio;
the Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Fort Belvoir,
Va.; the Army Weapons Sciences Directorate RD&E Center, Redstone Arsenal,
Ala.; and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.
   With the latest TRP awards, about $686 million in Pentagon funds have
been committed to the 131 projects.
   Meanwhile, Lee Buchanan, the TRP director, said this week that the
Department of Defense's plan to move the dual-use technology program from
ARPA to the Pentagon's defense research and engineering office (DDR&E)
responds to congressional perceptions that TRP has sometimes played down
military needs in choosing projects. The Joint Dual-Use Program Office will
also assure the Air Force, Army and Navy of involvement in project
selections and encourage them to integrate dual-use technologies in their
procurement decisions, he said in response to questions from Federal
Technology Report.
   ``The fact that the office is ultimately headed for DDR&E -- out of ARPA
-- reflects the complete emphasis on injecting the notion of dual use into
service procurement,'' he said. ``If this doesn't eventually end up
changing the way the services do business, it will not have been
successful.''
   Buchanan said it was ``not clear'' whether other federal agencies will
participate in future selections of dual-use technology projects, as they
have in the past.
   ``The emphasis is on DOD expenditures benefiting the military,'' he
said. ``Where that involves other agencies, and I imagine it can more than
not, we want them at the table. But there is no room for projects that
effectively transfer DOD money to civilian agencies.''

INEL PROPOSES FACILITY TO MIMIC EARTHQUAKES, OTHER DISASTERS

By:
David Kramer

   Idaho National Engineering Laboratory is proposing a new ``user
facility'' that would test the effects of earthquakes and other natural
disasters on new structural materials.
   The planned facility, which has already been dubbed the ``Advanced
Combined Effects Test Station,'' would exploit the peculiar geology at the
INEL site in southeast Idaho to enable scientists to generate earthquakes
comparable in intensity to the tremors that occurred in Kobe, Japan, and
North Ridge, Calif., in recent years.
   According to INEL Director Barton Krawetz, the region's fractured basalt
slope plain makes it seismically quiescent, and shock waves from the
manmade quakes would not propagate beyond the INEL site.
   In a recent interview, Krawetz said the ``Astrodome''-like facility is
expected to cost about $1 billion -- not much, he maintained, when measured
against the $180 billion in damage caused by the Kobe quake alone.
   Most of the funding would be derived not from INEL's parent, the
Department of Energy, but rather from other federal jurisdictions,
including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that respond to natural
disasters. Krawetz said he hoped that the facility can become a
``presidential initiative'' -- an elevated status that would vault it over
other projects competing for scarce federal funding.
   ``New structural materials other than iron and concrete can be advanced
only after full-scale testing. We think a user facility can appear here,''
Krawetz said.
   As with other user facilities located at DOE laboratories, ACETS'
customers would include both industry and university researchers. Krawetz
said he imagined it being used by the secondary insurance industry as well
as a company like Bechtel National Inc., which ``might want to bid on
building a new city in Saudi Arabia.''
   ACETS would also have a broad international appeal, and other nations,
including Japan, could be expected to contribute to its construction, he
said.
   The facility would be big enough to test structures hundreds of square
feet in size, Krawetz said. Apart from earthquakes, it would be capable of
producing winds as high as 200 miles per hour, as well as torrential rains.
While the area is arid, plenty of water is available from the Snake River
aquifer, he said.
   The facility would also help to re-establish INEL in the minds of the
research community, he noted.
   ``Some people think of us as a dump,'' Krawetz said, referring to INEL's
role as storage site for virtually all the types of radioactive wastes
roduced by DOE. ``We want to change the word on the street about this
place.''
Fees generated by ACETS also could help defray some of the fixed costs for
maintaining INEL from DOE's Environmental Management division, which is the
lab's landlord, he noted.

ATP, OTHER NIST PROGRAMS GET HIGH GRADES IN NEUTRAL REVIEW

By:
Bill Loveless

   An independent report card on the National Institute of Standards and
Technology released last week concludes that the Advanced Technology
Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership have enhanced NIST's
traditional work in standards and measures and not detracted from them, as
some critics of ATP and MEP have maintained.
   The annual assessment of NIST by a National Research Council board
suggests that eliminating ATP or MEP, which Congress established when it
broadened the institute's mandate in 1988, or tampering with NIST's
long-established programs, would result in more harm than good.
   ``Given the current political debate on the fate of the Department of
Commerce, and proposed legislation that would significantly reorganize NIST
and its functions, the board makes two observations,'' the report said.
``First, it is not possible for the nation to maintain government-certified
standards, weights and measures without the technical activities of the
NIST laboratories.''
   The report praised the ``cadre of highly qualified scientists and
engineers at NIST'' and described their work as ``absolutely essential'' to
maintaining the leading role of the U.S. standards and measurement system.
   ``Second,'' the report added, ``rather than detracting from the
traditional functions of NIST, the expanded role and new programs NIST has
assumed since 1988 have augmented that function in a positive manner. In
particular, the board has noted a synergy between the NIST laboratories and
the Advanced Technology Program, which has stimulated appropriate new
research directions in the laboratories and helped identify emerging needs
for standards and measurement services.''
   Although NIST contracts annually with NRC for the assessment, the
institute has no control over NRC's selection of board members nor over the
conclusions, a spokesman said this week. The latest review, which covers
FY-95, was conducted by 144 U.S. scientists and engineers from academic,
industrial and other research organizations.
   The board was chaired by Wilmer Bottoms of Patricof & Co.
   Although it credited NIST with assisting in the formation of high-tech
industries, the report acknowledged that specifically assessing the
institute's industrial impact is often difficult.
   ``Merely totaling the number of [cooperative r&d agreements] or industry
fellows is not an adequate measure of the impact the laboratories have on
U.S. industries,'' the report observed. ``Those counts do represent
valuable industrial cooperation on a case-by-case basis, but such numbers
could clearly be driven to excess if used as the only measure.''
   The report urged NIST to ``identify additional ways of measuring'' the
costs and benefits to the economy of the institute's programs.
   ``This effort is especially important as NIST's basic mission -- and the
funding provided by Congress to support it -- are under review,'' the
report said.
   NIST officials have admitted that their defense of ATP in the face of
attacks from the Republican-led Congress has been hampered because most of
the projects have not been completed yet and there is no generally accepted
way to measure their impact on the economy.
   Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have vowed to kill ATP this year,
although they relented in their opposition to MEP and agreed to legislation
providing funds for the program in FY-96 (FTR, 7 Dec, 1).
   Whether the NRC report will have any impact on NIST's critics in
Congress was uncertain, although the spokesman for the institute said NIST
considers the findings ``very useful'' in managing its labs and programs.
``It certainly doesn't hurt'' to have the NRC assessment, he added.
   The report followed by several weeks a broader review of federal science
and technology policy by the National Academy of Sciences that questioned
whether ATP would fulfill its goal of advancing technologies that the
private sector considers too risky to invest in (FTR, 7 Dec, 4). NRC is the
principal operating agency of the National Academy of Sciences.
   Participants in the earlier report, led by former NAS president Frank
Press, ``to our knowledge made no inquiries'' at NIST regarding ATP, the
institute's spokesman said. Those involved in the latest report, he added,
spent a considerable amount of time at NIST.
   For copies of the report, ``An Assessment of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology Programs, Fiscal Year 1995,'' contact the National
Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave., NW, Box 285, Washington, DC 20055;

ARPA OFFERS TO ASSIST LAUNCH OF SHIPBUILDING R&D PROJECTS

By:
Neil MacDonald

   As part of its marine technology (``MARITECH'') effort to help develop a
U.S. shipbuilding sector capable of competitive commercial construction and
affordable naval shipbuilding, the Advanced Research Projects Agency is
seeking ideas from the private sector for advanced technology development
projects.
   Up to $20 million is expected to be available from ARPA for projects,
with selection taking place during the second quarter of FY-96. The
proposals must be cost-shared, with ARPA only investing a maximum of 50% of
the total project cost.
   Despite its long tradition of innovation, in recent years the U.S.
commercial shipbuilding sector has languished, tending to license designs
for new ship types from foreign yards rather than develop them itself.
Little dual-use technology transfer has been evident in the past between
America's naval ship construction programs and the commercial sector.
   MARITECH could change all of that, according to ARPA. Advanced hull
forms and innovative designs, such as high-speed catamarans, hybrid
surface-effect ships, and low-wash multihulls, often developed by
Australian and European shipyards, have been particularly evident in the
U.S. passenger ferry scene.
   Otherwise, the only real bright spots in the picture have come from
yards building vessels for riverboat casino use.
   Two technology-related thrusts embodied in the latest MARITECH
solicitation are aimed at remedying some of these woes by improving
shipyard practices in fundamental ways. For example, applying various new
technologies and processes to make their business tasks such as market
analysis, supplier relations, materiel procurement, cost estimating and
financial systems more efficient.
   ARPA sees a range of communication and electronic commerce technologies
allowing some of these tasks to be better executed and integrated.
   In addition, total process systems could be used to address the
development and demonstration of system-wide, integrated, design and
production technologies.
   ARPA is not interested in ``individual technologies for specific
processes, rather its emphasis is on ``revolutionary, enterprise-wide
systems for the shipbuilding industry that would help dramatically reduce
the total time and cost of the design and construction process in U.S.
yards.''
   Possible technologies include total process simulation/modeling,
product-to-process decomposition, material tracking, advanced CAD/CAM/CIM,
yard layout, and the integration of these with management systems
technologies.
   MARITECH proposals are expected to come from teams featuring, typically,
a technology developer(s), shipyard, supplier, and shipowner or operator,
and to include a commercialization plan for the technology.
   By the project's conclusion, the technology is required to be capable of
demonstration. The closing date for proposals is Feb. 23.
   For more information, send a fax to Robert Schaffran at (703) 696-2204.

INDUSTRY EXTOLS PASSAGE OF LAW ON MERITLESS SECURITIES SUITS

   The first congressional repudiation of a veto by President Clinton
touched off celebrations among high-tech industries.
   Just before Christmas, both the Senate and House voted to override
Clinton's veto of legislation designed to curb so-called meritless
security-fraud lawsuits (FTR, 7 Dec, 6). It was the first time that a
Clinton veto had been rejected by Congress.
   ``From a Silicon Valley perspective, we are delighted that the House and
the Senate rectified an outrageous decision to veto this legislation,''
George Sollman, vice president of the American Electronics Assn. and chief
executive of Centigram Communications Corp., said in a statement issued by
AEA Dec. 22.
   ``As people have said about Silicon Valley -- there are two types of
CEOs -- those who have been sued and those who are about to be. We hope
this legislation will put an end to this type of legalized extortion.''
According to AEA, about 53% of Silicon Valley's high-tech companies have
been sued for allegedly violating the anti-fraud provisions of the nation's
securities laws.
   The new law attempts to thwart frivolous lawsuits by giving judges power
to sanction attorneys who make such filings and by having defendants pay
settlements according to their share of guilt.

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CENTER OFFERS MINORITY TRAINING

   Minority students will learn how to move technology from the laboratory
to the marketplace under a new program at the National Technology Transfer
Center.
   The Entrepreneurial Technology Apprentice Program (ETAP) will offer
students from historically black colleges and universities hands-on
training, mentoring and other assistance through a one-year course
addressing technology management, manufacturing assistance and industrial
r&d apprenticeships, NTTC said.
   The curriculum for the program, which is scheduled to begin in June, is
being developed by Wheeling Jesuit College, the home to NTTC, and the
center's staff.
   NTTC, a federally supported organization in Wheeling, W.Va., appointed
Faye Lyons-Gary as an associate director for ETAP.
   Lyons-Gary is one of two new officials at NTTC. The center also
announced recently its appointment of Chuck Millick as director of its
Wheeling operations.
   Lyons-Gary was the director of industrial relations at Clark Atlanta
University and The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and
Minority Institutions Environmental Technology Consortium before going to
NTTC.
   Among her other previous positions, Lyons-Gary was an intern with
Lockheed Martin Energy Systems' Office of Technology Transfer at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory.
   Currently three of the nation's 117 HBCUs are involved with ETAP:
Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio; the University of Arkansas at
Pine Bluff; and West Virginia State College in Institute, W.Va. Other
institutions have expressed interest in the program, NTTC said.
   ETAP will emphasize fund-raising so that it can expand to all HBCUs,
Lyons-Gary said.
   Although supported by the Department of Commerce's Minority Business
Development Agency, the NTTC program is also ``looking into contributions
from private industry, federal grants and foundations,'' she said.
   For more information on ETAP, call Lyons-Gary at (304) 243-4347.
   Millick, who was previously with General Electric, Kimberly Clark and
BDM, will help improve NTTC's information, training and other programs.
   ``These are very challenging times because our clients are changing as
the world is changing,'' Millick said. ``We need to work with our
customers, see what they require and provide them with valuable
resources.''
Millick said he also intends to strengthen NTTC's relationships with NASA,
which supplies the center's federal funding, and other government
agencies.

BUDGET IMPASSE STYMIES RULES ON FOREIGN LICENSES, INVENTIONS

By:
Neil MacDonald

   Two Department of Commerce proposals for modifying and streamlining
regulations for acquiring and protecting foreign rights to U.S. government
inventions, and for licensing of foreign patents acquired by the federal
government, remained in regulatory limbo at the end of the year due to the
federal budget crisis.
   They are just two of several regulatory changes proposed by DOC for
promulgation during FY-96. Most of the department has remained closed since
Dec. 16 as a result of the budget impasse, but an agency official familiar
with the proposals told Federal Technology Report last week that the
timetable for introducing the changes was now essentially up in the air.
   He said that when they were being planned last year, final action on
them by October had seemed a reasonable target. In retrospect, the present
budget situation and congressional attempts to dismantle Commerce made this
time frame look ``optimistic,'' he said.
   Although their wording has yet to be published, it is understood that
one of DOC's proposals by the Technology Administration advocates changes
to provide equal treatment of domestic and foreign rights to inventions
made by federal employees.
   Most federal inventions are the subject of only U.S. patent filings
unless there is an obvious or overwhelming need to also seek foreign patent
coverage.
   The process by which such decisions are currently made is believed to be
fairly arbitrary with some agencies seeking and often securing foreign
patent rights but failing to exploit them through foreign license
agreements. In addition, obtaining foreign patent rights is both an
expensive and time-consuming task.
   According to a DOC official, the second proposed change is ``motivated
by a desire for clarification'' of existing language regarding the
licensing of foreign patents owned by the federal government, and also
reflects some recommendations made by the Clinton administration as a
result of its campaign to ``reinvent'' government as a more efficient
enterprise.
   Both proposals -- known as Rule Identification Numbers 0692-AA15 and
0692-1116 -- are characterized as having ``substantive, nonsignificant''
priority levels with no legal deadlines and having no effect on small
entities.
   Another proposal -- 0692-AA14 -- by the Technology Administration deals
with an interim rule published in August that would allow certain federal
government contractors, mostly nonprofit organizations, small businesses
and grant recipients, to file notifications of their inventions and
election of title to funding agencies using approved forms of electronic
media.
   That rule would also update some earlier patent definitions. Final
action on the rule is expected in April.

PAPER REVIEWS FEDERAL IMPACT ON SMALL, HIGH-TECH COMPANIES

   A new report from the National Academy of Engineering suggests that one
of the best ways for Washington to help small high-tech companies is to
make sure that regulations and other traditional government functions
interfere as little as possible with their operations.
   The report, ``Risk and Innovation,'' says the government should
routinely assess the impact of its regulations on innovation among small
high-tech businesses and minimize them when possible, particularly in light
of the disfavor with which the Republican Congress looks on direct federal
funding for commercial technologies.
   Given that view on Capitol Hill, the report also urged the government to
go easy on university projects in deciding where to cut federal funding for
r&d. Campus r&d, it said, offers ``rich'' potential for new start-up
companies.
   The ``extreme budget consciousness'' in Congress means that federal
initiatives on behalf of small high-tech businesses should ``focus first on
establishing mechanisms within government -- many of them off-budget --
that can improve the general environment for innovative enterprises,'' the
report, prepared by the NAE Committee on Technology, Management, and
Capital in Small High-Tech Companies, said.
   ``Because the structure and implementation of regulations affect the
character and speed of innovation (through the risks they can create or
remove for companies), regulatory approaches across a wide variety of
government functions need to be carefully considered with regard to their
impact on small high-tech companies,'' the report said.
   The committee was chaired by Henry Kressel, managing director, Warburg,
Pincus & Co.
   ``Private investment is likely to be much greater than any imaginable
level of public investment in fragmented, technically dynamic industries
with low barriers to entry and a history (or widely perceived prospect of)
successful entrepreneurship,'' the panel said.
   ``In such industries the important question is, how can government
research, development, and demonstration complement the huge private
investment (risk-taking) to the benefit of the national economy?'' the
report said. ``The challenge in program design and implementation is to
articulate and adhere to an industry-specific rationale for government
support in light of substantial private sector activity ... .''
   The NAE committee also concluded that state and local governments should
have more say in the development of federal r&d programs, technical
assistance and other national mechanisms that promote economic growth.
``Local and regional programs may have an advantage in that they are closer
to the resources that small companies need and are potentially more able to
adapt to the needs of small high-tech companies,'' the report said.
   Although the report was not intended to comment specifically on federal
programs, it noted some concerns raised by the public regarding the
Advanced Technology Program, the Technology Reinvestment Project and the
Small Business Innovative Research program during meetings conducted by the
NAE panel.
   ``Participants in several of the industry-specific workshops, software
and medical devices in particular, noted that programs such as TRP, ATP and
SBIR that could provide financing for small high-tech companies were less
useful because of the long review cycles and time delays inherent in highly
bureaucratic programs,'' the report said.
   The NAE committee also came across criticism that SBIR spawned too many
companies, called ``SBIR houses,'' whose only income was funding from the
program, and that it adhered ``too rigidly'' to the missions of the
agencies providing its cash.
   The reaction, the report said, reflected the findings of a recent
General Accounting Office report, which concluded that while the quality of
proposals submitted to SBIR ``remains high,'' multiple awards to the same
companies ``has become a problem.''

NTIA REVISES POLICY ON GRANTS WITH `SECTARIAN' IMPLICATIONS

   The National Telecommunications and Information Administration recently
modified a policy that had prohibited it from awarding grants to
organizations involved in sectarian activities.
   Under the change, the Department of Commerce unit will no longer reject
a grant application simply on the basis that an award ``might result in
some attenuated or incidental benefit to sectarian interests,'' NTIA said
in a Dec. 20 statement.
   The revised policy affects three NTIA activities: the Telecommunications
and Information Infrastructure Assistant Program, the Public
Telecommunications Facilities Program, and the National Endowment for
Childrens's Educational Television.
   As a result of the change, the government also entered into a settlement
with Fordham University under which Fordham will receive a Public
Telecommunications Facilities Program grant to install radio broadcast
services, NTIA said.
   Fordham was previously ruled ineligible for such a grant because its
radio station broadcasts a Catholic Mass each week, NTIA said.

NIST PREPARES `ULTIMATE RULER' TO GAUGE VAST ATOMIC LANDSCAPE

   Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology are
testing what they view as the ultimate molecular ruler and a potentially
valuable tool for the semiconductor industry.
   Once fine-tuned, the Molecular Measuring Machine -- or M3 -- will be
capable of locating molecule-sized features in vast expanses and of gauging
``with unprecedented accuracy'' the distances between them, according to
NIST, which held a press conference recently to report on the machine's
progress.
   The new machine's range is 250,000 times greater than that of most
scanning tunneling microscopes, which are generally used now to perform
such measurements, NIST said.
   ``For perspective,'' NIST said, ``M3's anticipated capabilities are akin
to being able to locate two widely separated grains of sand in a ...
960-square mile patch of desert and then to measure the distance between
them to within 1 millimeter.''
   In tests so far, the machine measured specimens encompassing only a
small part of its planned 50-millimeter span, NIST said. In subsequent
tests, it will measure specimens over its entire range.
   The machine is considered especially important to the semiconductor
industry, NIST noted.
   ``For the semiconductor industry to continue its decades-long trend of
crowding ever more and ever smaller devices on slivers of silicon, it will
soon require measurement methods that are accurate to within 0.0024
micrometer, or 2.5 nanometers,'' the institute said.
   M3 will be used to calibrate various measurement references that
semiconductor manufacturers can use to check the accuracy of their own
measurement equipment, NIST said.
   A number of organizations have collaborated with NIST on the machine,
including Hewlett-Packard Corp., Zygo Corp., Intelligent Automation, Inc.,
and Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Oak Ridge national laboratories.

Scale Metrology Group, (301) 975-3490; E-mail, ecteague@micf.nist.gov .

REPORT PROMPTS DOE TO APPROVE LASER FUSION UNIT AT LIVERMORE

By:
David Kramer

   Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has determined formally that the National
Ignition Facility supports U.S. nonproliferation objectives, clearing the
way for construction of the $1.1 billion laser fusion device at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory.
   The decision, announced Dec. 20, followed a lengthy public examination
of claims by environmental groups that NIF, which is designed to mimic on a
laboratory scale the fusion stage of nuclear weapons, would present
proliferation problems.
   A report prepared by the Department of Energy's arms control and
nonproliferation office concluded instead that NIF would advance U.S.
nonproliferation objectives because it would allow the nation to sign on to
a treaty outlawing nuclear testing.
   The unprecedented study was requested by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif.,
former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who had questioned
whether the facility would aid or hinder the spread of nuclear weapons.
O'Leary ordered the examination in September 1994. The report, which was
reviewed by outside experts, concluded that the technical proliferation
concerns posed by NIF would be ``manageable'' (FTR, 28 Sept, 12).
   ``I am pleased that we can now move forward to meet our goals in
stockpile stewardship,'' O'Leary said in a statement. ``The National
Ignition Facility will contribute to the ability of the United States to
maintain its nuclear stockpile without underground testing. We are
committed to operating the facility in the most open manner possible while
supporting our objective of reducing the global nuclear danger.''
   DOE considers NIF a key element of its ``science-based stockpile
stewardship program''-- its plan for ensuring the continuing reliability
and safety of remaining nuclear weapons without the need for underground
tests.
   Jackie Cabasso, executive director of the Western States Legal
Foundation, and a leading NIF opponent, said the report's ``conclusions are
not supported by its findings.'' The study, she said, ``does not change the
fact that NIF is a very serious threat to nonproliferation policy, both
through the development of innovative technologies for nuclear weapons
development and by example for a renewed commitment to nuclear weapons as
an instrument of national policy.''
   Cabasso called ``contradictory'' the U.S. position of supporting a
comprehensive test ban treaty while at the same time building new
facilities to substitute for testing. She also expressed dismay that the
final version of the report had not been made available publicly prior to
O'Leary's announcement, saying the omission ``belies DOE's real serious
commitment to public participation.''
   But Rep. Bill Baker, R-Calif., who represents the Livermore area,
commented that ``NIF will play a vital role not only in keeping America's
national defense second to none, but also in developing renewable energy
resources for our future.''
   NIF construction will bring 2,500 jobs to Livermore, while 1,000
permanent staff positions are expected to be created. The facility is
expected to be completed in 2002.

GAO QUESTIONS DOE PLAN TO MOVE SUPERCOMPUTER UNIT TO BERKELEY

By:
David Kramer

   The General Accounting Office has concluded that a Department of Energy
plan to relocate a supercomputing center from one national lab to another
will not be cost-effective, according to Rep. Bill Baker, R-Calif., who
requested the evaluation from the congressional watchdog.
   But DOE's number-two official insisted that the GAO findings were
``consistent with'' the agency's decision to move the center from Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Deputy Secretary Charles Curtis told Baker Dec. 21 that cost was only one
of six criteria considered in the relocation.
   ``We continue to believe that our decision to relocate the center to
LBNL is in the best interest of the public ... ,'' Curtis said in a letter
to Baker. The decision, he added, ``was based on a peer review process
aimed at securing the highest level of long-term performance in [DOE]
mission areas.''
Baker, who represents the Livermore area, had cited the findings of the GAO
report, which was released Dec. 19, in asking DOE to take another look at
its plan to move the National Energy Research Supercomputer Center.
   `` ... [T]his new NERSC proposal is a costly effort that would achieve
no clear scientific benefit,'' Baker said in releasing the GAO report. ``I
am very concerned by this ill-conceived and unjustified proposal, and plan
to urge the Energy Department to carefully reevaluate it.''
   The GAO report, which examined only the costs of the NERSC move, said
that relocating the facility to LBNL could cost more than the $4.4 million
estimated by LBNL. In addition, GAO calculated that maintenance of the
facility at LBNL would cost about $617,000 more annually than it would to
keep NERSC at LLNL.
   In what DOE officials had earlier acknowledged was largely a
budget-driven exercise, DOE's Office of Energy Research sought competing
bids from LLNL and LBNL last year for operation of NERSC, and instructed
the labs to assume a 15% to 20% reduction in funding from FY-95 levels. The
labs' proposals were evaluated by an outside panel of specialists, the
majority of whom recommended that the center be relocated to LBNL.
   While the two bids were nearly identical in cost terms, LBNL offered to
run the center with essentially its existing 100 staff, while LLNL proposed
to cut 14 positions. GAO noted that LBNL was able to maintain staff levels
in part by drafting nine graduate students from the adjacent University of
California at Berkeley.
   Despite its location at LLNL, NERSC is used solely for unclassified
research, mainly by programs supported by DOE's Office of Energy Research
(ER). The decision to relocate the facility to LBNL, an ER-administered
lab, raised suspicions that DOE was motivated by a wish to consolidate ER
programs in ER facilities, and possibly ``prop up'' LBNL. Both motives were
denied by DOE officials.
   In its review, GAO warned that LBNL may have underestimated the
relocation expenses. It said that while Berkeley had included the cost to
move about 220 people within the lab to accommodate the move, additional
relocations could be required. And DOE may need to incur additional costs
to convert the vacated NERSC facility at Livermore to a new use, it said.
   A DOE official said this week that LBNL has since ``scrubbed'' the
moving estimates and stands by the $4.4 million figure.
   GAO said David Nelson, the ER associate director for computational and
technology research, told its auditors that cost was only one of six
criteria that his office used in evaluating the proposals. Others included
benefits to ER; impact on ER missions through interdisciplinary internal
and external collaborations; lab management's support; and demonstrated
capability to integrate future technological advances to support ER's
computing and communications needs.
   Baker complained that many LLNL employees will experience considerable
inconvenience because of the ``unsound'' move.
   ``I am very concerned that for the sake of bureaucratic reshuffling, a
significant number of hard-working men and women are going to have to begin
prolonged commutes from Livermore to Berkeley,'' he said. ``Satisfying
Washington bureaucrats is not a good enough reason to disrupt the lives of
LLNL employees.''
   Baker also termed unsatisfactory the explanation he had received from
Curtis for the relocation, which was announced Nov. 3.
   ``Mr. Curtis said in his [Nov. 3] letter that LBNL offered `superior
long-range vision' and `improved opportunities for internal and external
collaboration.' This is obscure, bureaucratic nonsense that fails to
explain any sound basis for the proposed move,'' he said.

LIVERMORE CONFERENCE EXPLORES NEW LINKS WITH SMALL BUSINESS

   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hosted a one-day conference last
month to explore new ways for large organizations, including national labs,
to forge links with small- and medium-sized manufacturers and suppliers.
The conference was co-sponsored by the CommerceNet ``Commerce at Light
Speed'' project, an effort by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research
Projects Agency to promote business over the Internet, and by LLNL, in
support of the Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing-National
Information Infrastructure program.
   According to the LLNL Newsline, Roger Flanagan, AM-NII project
coordinator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, said the $24 million effort
was initiated in 1994 in recognition that DOE was still doing many things
``the old way.'' He said project founders realized that DOE needed to
employ new manufacturing strategies used by private industry as well as new
information technologies to streamline and strengthen relationships with
commercial suppliers.
   The program's current emphasis, Flanagan said, is on filling needs
affecting several sites managed by DOE's Defense Programs division,
outsourcing more services and completing pilot projects in key technical
areas. These areas include distributed simulation (Y-12 Plant), technical
data exchange (Kansas City Plant), security and intelligence agents (Sandia
National Laboratories), enterprise information modeling (Los Alamos
National Laboratory) and electronic commerce (LLNL).
   Mike Snow, the DP representative for AM-NII, told Newsline that DOE's
weapons complex used to have a high volume of design and production tasks
with competition between sites for assignments and plenty of time and
resources to get the job done.
   Today DOE is fielding no new nuclear weapons designs and is dedicated to
maintaining the nuclear stockpile and components. In fulfilling its new
responsibilities, he said, the department is facing a scarcity of
resources, uncertain production needs, limited testing opportunities,
declining funding, an aging work force and a shrinking knowledge base.
   To overcome these challenges, Snow told Newsline, DOE must initiate
greater teamwork among its many departments and labs and with its
industrial suppliers, limit and expedite prototypes, do more modeling and
simulation work and move to more flexible manufacturing. It must also
improve information handling to connect workers with data instead of
``moving bodies around'' from site to site.

LAB RESURRECTS CLOSED FACILITY FOR ION-IMPLANTATION RESEARCH

   With help from a shuttered fusion experiment at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, a new process for surface treating materials to improve their
wear resistance will soon go commercial.
   Scientists at Los Alamos and the University of Wisconsin have begun
working under an Advanced Technology Program-backed cooperative r&d
agreement with an 11-company consortium that includes General Motors Corp.
Harley-Davidson Inc. and A.O. Smith Corp., to further scale up the
technique of implanting ions on the surfaces of materials. The implantation
process alters the structure of the material in such a way as to harden
it.
   According to Don Rej, a LANL technical staff member who was the first
principal investigator on the project, the CRADA partners are using a
UW-developed process known as Plasma Surface Ion Implantation and
equipment, facilities and computer modeling capabilities at LANL. The first
two commercial systems for PSII are being built by North Star Research
Corp., Albuquerque, N.M.
   One of the North Star-built units is to be placed in commercial
wear-hardening service at Empire Hard Chrome Inc., Chicago. It is expected
to be used for large-scale automotive and other industrial applications.
The other unit will be shipped to a research facility in Finland.
   Prior to perfecting the plasma technique of implantation, the PSII
process was considered too expensive, slow and complicated for widespread
commercial use. But, according to the fall issue of ``USCAR Dateline
2000,'' a comprehensive cost analysis, including amortized capital
equipment, personnel and consumables, predict large-scale treatment costs
of less than half a penny per square centimeter.
   According to Rej, the primary advantage to the PSII process over the
better-known beamline ion implantation method, is the former's ability to
harden material faces which are not in the ``line of sight'' of a beam. In
PSII, the part is immersed in the plasma in which the ions are produced.
Beamlines are produced by accelerators, and if more than one surface area
is to be treated, the part must be manipulated to expose the particular
surfaces.
   GM and LANL recently completed work in PSSI under a CRADA that began in
1991. According to Rej, the lab is now proposing to continue that work
under auspices of the threatened Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, the consortium of several government agencies and the Big Three
automakers.
   According to a summary of the three-year, $15.5 million ATP project,
automakers are interested in the process because it could be used to treat
the surfaces of lightweight aluminum or magnesium alloys so they can
withstand the high wear and other demanding environmental conditions
characteristic of engines. Substituting these materials for steel and iron
could result in a 10% decrease in the cost of making automobile
powertrains.
   ATP is administered by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
   PSII also could be used to treat the surfaces of dies and tools,
resulting in an expected 10-fold increase in performance life.
   The ATP project will aim to develop and demonstrate prototype
technologies for high-volume applications of PSII. The technology has never
been applied in treatment chambers larger than 1 cubic meter. Unknowns
include the behavior of plasmas in large systems and the uniformity of
treatment achieved on irregularly shaped parts.
   Rej said LANL's primary contribution has been scaling up the technology,
which was developed by UW with support from the National Science
Foundation. The university had only a small table-top unit, while Los
Alamos had a much larger device left over when DOE canceled its alternative
concepts fusion program. The lab also had high voltage technology from its
nuclear physics and Strategic Defense Initiative programs, and computer
modeling capabilities from its nuclear weapons program.
   Other members of the ATP consortium are ABB High Power Semiconductors,
Pittsburgh; Diversified Technologies Inc., Bedford, Mass.; Empire Hard
Chrome; IONEX, Bellaire, Mich.; Kwikset Corp., Anaheim, Calif.; Litton
Electronic Devices, San Carlos, Calif.; NANO Instruments Inc., Oak Ridge,
Tenn.; and PVI, Oxnard, Calif.

DOE'S BARTLESVILLE LAB EXTENDS $100,000 FOR OIL-RECOVERY R&D

   The Department of Energy's National Institute for Petroleum and Energy
Research, Bartlesville, Okla., will provide $100,000 to James E. Russell
Petroleum Inc. to improve a new process to clean water used in oil field
operations.
   The ``air flotation process'' emerged from an earlier DOE co-sponsored
project with Russell Petroleum and the University of Kansas. Russell
Petroleum, Abilene, Texas, will contribute $102,000 of its own to continue
research on the project.
   According to DOE, water produced with oil is often reinjected into the
reservoir to increase the efficiency of the oil recovery operation. But
impurities in the water can plug the tiny pores in the reservoir rock,
often blocking the water from reaching the target zones.
   In the air flotation process, air is bubbled through a flotation column.
Waste impurities cling to the air bubbles and are removed from the water.
The technique, a modification of a process originally developed to clean
coal and other minerals, has been used in some offshore oil operations. It
was unclear, however, whether the process would be cost-effective for
onshore oil fields, particularly those operated by smaller, independent
producers, DOE said.
   According to DOE, the original Russell Petroleum project showed that the
air flotation device may make economic sense for many independent
producers. The company credits the technology with contributing to the
recovery of some 300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would have been left
in the ground.
   Under the second phase of the project, which will last 18 months,
Russell Petroleum will develop screening criteria to help other producers
determine where and when the process can be applied; develop optimum design
and operating guidelines for the technology; determine the cost of
implementing critical design improvements; and communicate the correct
method of applying the technology and its benefits to other operators.
   The original project was funded under DOE's Reservoir Class Field
Demonstration Program, which is aimed at demonstrating ways that oil
producers can avoid prematurely abandoning their wells.
   The Russell Petroleum follow-on project is the result of a solicitation
DOE issued to the 33 participants in the ``near-term'' category of the
program. The department has recently requested proposals for follow-on
projects from participants in ``mid-term'' and other categories of the
program.

ELECTROCHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL

   Los Alamos National Laboratory is testing a simple treatment method that
may help small businesses eliminate hazardous wastes from their production
lines. The system may also greatly reduce the volume of inorganic mixed
wastes in storage at Department of Energy facilities like Los Alamos.
   The electrochemical process works at room temperature and low pressure
and runs on familiar direct-current electricity, the lab said. It does not
produce toxic fumes or secondary waste.
   Heavy metals are removed and recovered. Cyanides and toxic organic
compounds are broken into harmless carbon dioxide and nitrogen. And all the
work is done by electrons flowing through the solution.
   The system may prove to be a boon to hospitals and industries that
produce small volumes of hazardous waste, the lab said. Developing separate
treatment methods for each kind of waste is prohibitively expensive. The
electrochemical process, in contrast, can treat many substances cheaply and
safely.
   In December, Los Alamos began expanding the treatment system from a
bench-top experiment that handled less than 2 gallons per day to a pilot
project capable of treating the contents of a 55-gallon drum per day. Jacek
Dziewinski, who leads the project, estimated about 90% of the inorganic
mixed wastes at Los Alamos could be treated using this method.
   Los Alamos is developing the treatment system in partnership with
Faraday Technology Inc., Dayton, Ohio. The company is optimizing the
process for industrial waste streams, especially those with heavy metals,
while Los Alamos is working on mixed waste containing radioactive
materials.
   The original work that led to the concepts developed by Faraday
Technology Inc. was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the
Department of Defense. The Los Alamos research is sponsored by the
Laboratory's Environmental Management Programs.
   For more information, contact Dziewinski at (505) 667-9792.

PARTNERS FOR BIOFUEL PROJECT

   Companies interested in forming partnerships for the development of
commercial equipment for a unique biomass pretreatment technology are being
sought by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Described by NREL as an
``important step in an overall process for producing ethanol and
potentially other commodity chemicals from cellulose biomass,'' the
technology is part of a major project within a biofuels program that NREL
manages for the Department of Energy.
   The project involves the conversion of a wide range of cellulosic
biomass items, such as agricultural and forestry residues, wastepaper,
municipal solid waste, underutilized wood, waste from paper and pulp
production, herbaceous energy crops, and woody energy crops, into ethanol
as a transportation fuel.
   Currently NREL is operating a process development unit (PDU) from which
it is gathering essential data for scaling up the pilot plant to a size
able to commercialize the conversion of biomass to ethanol. Potential
corporate partners would be encouraged to use the PDU infrastructure to
evaluate pilot-scale or prototype equipment designs, the lab said.
   With ethanol production from corn already providing over 1 billion
gallons a year for fuel blending purposes, NREL feels that ``significant
opportunities to further penetrate'' the oxygenate market in the short
term, as well as supply of large amounts of near-pure ethanol for use as a
gasoline substitute, could exist if the costs of ethanol production from
cellulosic biomass could be lowered.
   At this stage, NREL is only seeking ``expressions of interest'' from
potential partners and sees several possible collaborative mechanisms,
including cooperative r&d agreements, cost-shared subcontracts, and
researcher exchanges.
   For more information, contact Ray Prazak at (303) 384-6876 or Scott
Montgomery at (303) 275-3193.

Formulation of
Flexible Firestops

A flexible, fire retardant material intended for use as firestops
in deterring the spread of fire, smoke and fumes during fires in
buildings has been formulated by researchers at 3M (St. Paul, MN
55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110).  Walton W. Welna reports that the
product includes an intumescent material, a stabilizing agent and
an elastomeric organic binder throughout which the intumescent
material and stabilizing agent are dispersed.

Fire, smoke and fumes in confined spaces, such as multifloor
buildings, can be life threatening.  Frequently fire originating in
the space between a floor and ceiling of such a structure will
spread, along with the resultant smoke and fumes, to other open
spaces in the building, especially to open spaces above the point
of origin of the fire.  The spaces between conduits and piping and
the floors and ceilings through which they pass, or through
penetrations, must be protected by fire resistant materials.  A
through penetration offers an area of low resistance to fire, smoke
and fumes and may serve as a chimney for heat, flame and fumes.
Through penetrations may be filled with commercially available fire
retardant and intumescent putties, caulks, wraps, sheets or mats,
or firestops.

Many commercially available firestop products can reduce or
eliminate the chimney effect for through penetrations and pass the
rigorous ASTM E-814 fire endurance test.  After intumescing and
charring, the material is not easily blown out of penetrations when
subjected to water hose pressure typical of fire fighting
conditions.  Essential characteristics of a firestop material
include the ability to expand and to char, and the charred material
must have enough strength to withstand the test conditions.
Although adequate firestops exist, the goal of 3M researchers was
to formulate a product which retains its expansion, low compression
set, and flexibility after long-term exposure to oxidative
environments.

3M says that the new firestops are an improvement over existing
products because they have superior aging properties, i.e., they
are more resistant to degradation due to ozone and/or oxygen.  They
also have low compression set in the unexpanded state, and superior
char strength in the expanded state.  Finally, the firestops use
ingredients which are believed to be less toxic than those in
conventional compositions.

The intumescent material in the 3M product is a granular hydrated
alkali metal silicate with an average particle size of 0.2-2.0
millimeters (mm).  About 95% by weight of the particles are greater
than 0.2 mm in size.  The alkali metal silicates which work best
are granulated sodium silicates with a moisture content of 5-30% by
weight and a silicon dioxide (SiO2) to sodium oxide (Na2O) ratio in
the 2.0:1.0 to about 3.75:1.0 range.  The elastomeric binder is at
least partially crosslinked, and the stabilizing agent has a
melting point of 105-125(C.  Enough of the stabilizing agent must
be used to keep the composite expansion and compression set
properties stable, even after prolonged exposure to oxidative
conditions.  The 3M product is described in U.S. Patent 5,476,891.

Additives Can Further
Improve Properties

It may be possible to find effective intumescent flame retardant
additives to further reduce the ignitability, heat release rate and
smoke generation of even the best flame retardant plastics,
composites, adhesives, and fabrics, says a scientist at Polytechnic
University (Six Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201; Tel: 718/260-
3715).  Edward D. Weil reports that in some cases there are
empirical guidelines, and in other cases theory points our
promising directions.

Shifting the degradation pathway away from volatile fuel release to
crosslinking and/or the generation of vapors with low fuel values
may represent the likely basis for the highly effective phosphorus-
based flame retardant systems in cellulose.  The degradation is
shifted from volatile levoglucosan to the formation of crosslinked
char.  Enhanced water release is undoubtedly another important
factor.  A quantitative study of the thermal effects of flame
retarding cellulose by alkali showed that the reduction of the fuel
content of the volatiles counteracted the enhanced rate of
degradation and enhanced volatile generation.

Crosslinking, char enhancement and water release are probably the
main modes of action of phosphorus flame retardants in certain
other systems, i.e., in rigid urethane systems, reports Weil.
Phosphorus flame retardants have several other distinct modes of
action, including endothermic, radical scavenging and coating
effects.

Work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
has provided quantum chemical support for the concept that
crosslinking should help flame retardancy.  The initial formation
of thermally stable crosslinks begins the process of char formation
and retards the formation of volatile fuels.  For instance, the
dechloranes, together with certain metal oxides, are high
temperature vulcanizing agents for polyolefin elastomers.  When
they are used as flame retardants, the result is greatly increased
char yield.

This concept also works with a fairly wide range of thermoplastics
where there is a functional group that can be exploited for
purposes of crosslinking.  Acid catalysts flame retard polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA), apparently by causing anhydride links to form.
In some cases, they cause crosslinks to form.

Various other polymer-specific catalytic systems have been found.
One is the action of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) as a catalyst for the
trimerization of the nitrile group in styrene-acrylonitrile
copolymers, with resultant char enhancement.  Sulfonate salt flame
retardants, which work at very low levels in polycarbonates, are
catalysts for the formation of an intumescent char, although
increased carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution may also have an effect.

Another polymer-specific additive that is almost surely catalytic
is platinum used at low levels in peroxide-cured silica-filled
silicone rubbers.  The details of the catalytic effect of platinum
are not clear, although it may somehow inhibit depolymerizaton of
the siloxane structure.  This is one of the most effective flame
retardants known, and it has a detectable effect at parts per
million (ppm) levels.  It provides reason to hope that other such
highly efficient catalyst systems may be found.

Dow Corning's New
Resin Modifiers

A new family of resin modifiers in solid silicone powder form is
being marketed by Dow Corning Corp. (Midland, MI 48686).  Marketed
under the somewhat confusing name "Si Powder Resin Modifiers," the
product is a free flowing, 100% active silicone powder intended to
enhance the physical properties of highly filled flame retardant
thermoplastics, modify thermoplastic burning characteristics, and
improve processing efficiency.

Dow Corning developed the additives to meet the needs of
compounders and injection molders, who want the benefits of a
silicone additive.  The second goal was to improve some of the fire
performance characteristics of plastics without negatively
affecting processing and molding properties.  The Dow Corning
contact is Thomas Vassallo (Tel: 517/496-6289), Additives Industry
Manager.

Si Powder additives are believed to be compatible with halogenated,
halogen-free and phosphorus-based flame retardant additives in a
wide variety of thermoplastic powders.  They are easy to compound
and can be premixed with thermoplastic pellets or powders.  The
additives significantly reduce the rate of heat release and the
evolution of smoke and carbon monoxide of burning plastics such as
polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene and polycarbonate.

Loading levels of 0.1-1.0% permit the resin modifiers to reduce
extruder torque and power consumption and improve the surface gloss
of the final product, but loadings of 1.0-8.0% are required to
modify the burning characteristics of thermoplastics.

Loadings of 3.0-5.0% can restore the impact resistance that flame
retardant additives tend to produce, and levels in the 15% range
may actually improve impact strength.  Such loadings can also
reduce the required loadings of the primary flame retardant
additives.  The new modifiers are available in several grades with
different organic reactivity.

The type of organic reactivity determines compatibility and
performance in particular applications.  The powders are available
in 5-pound samples, 100-pound fiber packs or in bulk.  Dow Corning
is testing Si Powder additives for use in polyolefins, styrenics,
vinyl resins, engineering thermoplastics, and thermoplastic
elastomers.

Phosphorus-Based
Masterbatches Debut

Albright & Wilson Americas (Box 26229, Richmond, VA 23260) has
introduced its trademarked Amgard CPC 400 Series of red phosphorus-
based flame retardant masterbatches.  Mark Huggard says that the
Amgard CPC 400 products include 50% red phosphorus in various
carriers.  The nonhalogenated products do not require synergists to
achieve maximum flame retardant performance.  All of the new
products are solid pellets and are intended for use in nylon 6,
nylon 6,6, polyamide and glass-filled polyamide resins.  End use
applications include wire and cable jacketing, extruded products,
and injection molding resins.

Advantages of the Amgard CPC 400 products include minimum loss of
physical properties in compounded products, excellent thermal
stability and chemical inertness.  They facilitate nonblooming in
final products and have minimal impact on the electrical properties
of base polymers.

Composite Walls
Keep Prisons Secure

A composite security wall system with high impact performance and
compliant with certain fire codes has been built by engineers at GE
Plastics (One Plastics Ave., Pittsfield, MA 01201; 800/845-0600 or
413/448-7110).  Bruce M. Torrey reports that the security wall can
be employed in wall systems in institutions such as minimum
security prisons, detention areas, hospitals, asylums and
psychiatric facilities.

The GE composite, more fully described in U.S. Patent 5,477,652,
includes a thermoplastic polycarbonate sheet and a gypsum board dry
wall product laminated together with an adhesive.  The easy to
install composite is then fastened to wall studs with the
thermoplastic sheet on the inside, i.e., in contact with the wall
studs.

Providing the building and construction industry with an easy to
install, high impact and penetration resistant security wall system
has proven difficult.  Current designs call for the installation of
metal mesh with gypsum board or concrete or masonry wall products,
which are heavy and costly to install.  Other gypsum type products
that are double walled would add considerably to overall
construction costs.  Since such security wall products require
double installation or expensive masonry or concrete products, a
single composite security wall system would significantly reduce
overall costs by being easy to install.

One product on the market today that has been successfully used in
security wall systems is a material with a gypsum core and
densified gypsum outer layers.  While this product provides higher
impact than standard gypsum, it must be double walled to provide
enough security for institutional use.  Its impact resistance, 100
foot pounds (ft. lbs.) or less, is not sufficient to meet the
requirements of many applications.

Other systems that have been used to provide impact performance and
to meet building code requirements for fire resistance consist of
masonry products or several (more than two) layers of gypsum board.
Still other approaches call for the use of metal mesh welded to
metal studs with gypsum board fastened over the metal mesh.  The
gypsum board in this system would actually be fastened to the metal
wall studs.

The polycarbonate sheet used in the GE system is normally about
0.080 inch thick and does not exceed 0.125 inch.  Such a system can
withstand an impact of well in excess of 650 ft. lbs. on the dry
wall side.  In fact, the impact could not actually be measured,
since the metal studs collapsed without the composite cracking or
breaking.  Other materials tested for impact failed at 100-200 ft.
lbs. of impact.

In addition to impact resistance, the composite also meets the
requirement of the National Fire Protection Assn. (NFPA) Life
Safety Code 101 as "Limited Combustible" under NFPA Standard 295.
This standard also requires the product to meet strict flame spread
(ASTM E84) and BTU per lb. limits not exceeding 3500 BTU per lb. of
sample, as outlined in NFPA Standard 259.  A test sample of the new
composite that included a 0.81 inch thick polycarbonate sheet,
contact adhesive and gypsum wallboard 0.75 inch thick, when
subjected to the NFPA 259 and NFPA 101 Limited Combustibles tests,
had a total BTU content of 1746 BTU's per lb. of content.

Foam Fills Holes in
Structural Components

Engineers at BASF Corp. (3000 Continental Dr., Mt. Olive, NJ 07828-
1234; Tel: 201/426-2600) have formulated flame retardant rigid
polyurethane/polyisocyanurate foams containing paraffinic based
oils intended for use in filling water-containing cavities in
structural components.  Agus Sampara reports that BASF formulated
a rigid polyurethane foam to which a base stock lubricating oil
made of at least 55% by weight of paraffinic carbons and less than
10% by weight aromatic carbons was added.

The hydrophobic agent protects the polyurethane foam from reacting
with environmental moisture.  The foam is intended for deposit in
railroad spike holes or any structural member with a cavity in
which moisture would otherwise react with the isocyanate to produce
an uncontrollable foaming mass.

Considerable attention is being directed toward repairing rather
than replacing structural components, such as railroad ties, as a
more efficient and cost effective means for extending the use of
the whole structure.  When a section of rail must be replaced, or
during routine railroad maintenance, the rail is detached from the
ties by removing the spikes and tie plates, leaving behind railroad
ties having spike holes.  Before these railroad ties can be reused,
the spike holes must be plugged to provide the tie with structural
integrity and prevent water from accumulating within the hole and
rotting the wood.

Various methods to plug spike holes have been proposed, including
driving wooden dowels or metal inserts through the hole.  These
methods  are labor intensive and often leave gaps between the
insert and tie through. The gaps can be a place for water to
accumulate.

An alternative approach is to plug the spike holes with a high
density rigid polyurethane foam.  The problem is that environmental
water or moisture in the holes causes the injected polyurethane
composition to foam uncontrollably, resulting in an undesirable low
density foamed mass with low strength.  A proposed solution is a
hydrophobic urethane employing a coal tar or a coal tar pitch
additive.

The coal tar repels environmental water present and prevents water
from reacting with the foam ingredients.  Unfortunately, coal tar
pitch is predominately composed of polynuclear aromatic compounds
including volatile components carcinogenic to humans such as
anthracene, phenanthrene, and acridine.  Coal tar is also a known
carcinogen and contains numerous aromatic volatiles toxic by
inhalation.

Consequently, the BASF engineers set out to find an alternative to
coal tar based rigid polyurethane foam products which would prevent
the urethane composition from reacting with environmental water or
moisture, while reducing the carcinogenic health risks associated
with the aromatic compounds in coal tar.

The BASF rigid polyurethane/polyisocyanurate is produced by
reacting an organic polyisocyanate with a polyol compound having at
least two isocyanate reaction hydrogens, a lubricating oil with a
base stock having at least 55% by weight carbon atoms in paraffinic
form and no more than 10% by weight carbon atoms in aromatic form,
a foaming agent and a urethane promoting catalyst.  Crosslinkers,
surfactants, emulsifiers and/or a trimerization catalyst to promote
the formation of the isocyanurate structure may also be used.  The
paraffinic based oil is a mixture of paraffinic and naphthenic
hydrocarbons and contains only trace amounts of aromatic
hydrocarbons.

Among the flame retardants which may be used are pentabromodiphenyl
oxide, dibromopropanol, tris(b-chloropropyl)phosphate, 2,2-bis(-
bromoethyl) 1,3-propanediol, tetrakis(2-chloroethyl) ethyl
diphosphate, bis-(2-chloroethyl) 2-chloroethylphosphonate,
molybdenum trioxide, ammonium molybdate, ammonium phosphate,
pentabromodiphenyl oxide, tricresylphosphate,
hexabromocyclododecane and dibromoethyl dibromocyclohexane.  These
flame retardant additives are used in concentrations of 1-25 parts
per 100 parts of polyol mixture.  U.S. Patent 5,476,681 protects
the BASF product.

New Product for
Cable Insulation

A nonhalogenated flame retardant insulation with high oxygen index
has been prepared by researchers at Champlain Cable Corp. (Hercules
Dr., Colchester, VT 05446; Tel: 802/655-2121, Fax: 802/655-2025).
Howard F. McRae reports that the new product features a synergistic
combination of chemistry and irradiation for fabricating wire and
cable insulation and heat shrinkable tubing.  Other advantages are
believed to include improved tensile strength and elongation.

Superior insulating construction materials such as tiles and wall
boards can be produced by a polycondensation process in which
carboxyl groups of an olefinic base are linked with the silanol
groups of a silicone material.  The silanol groups are linked with
hydroxyl groups contained in a hydrated fire retardant filler to
provide an insulation that tolerates high loadings of the flame
retardant.  Although crosslinking in these formulations allow the
inclusion of large amounts of fire retardant filler materials in
the insulation, they cannot be processed into wire insulation of
commercial quality.

One of the drawbacks is that they cannot be easily extruded.
Another difficulty is their characteristically substandard tensile
strength, elongation and flexibility.  The increased crosslinking
of these formulations, while improving the fire retardancy through
higher flame retardant loadings, binds the polymer chains to the
extent that flexibility and elongation are impaired.  Such
overbinding, while useful in tiles and wall construction materials
which are not commercially affected by the reduced flexibility and
elongation, hinders performance in wire and cable insulation.

The Champlain Cable product reflects the discovery that commercial
grade insulation for wire and cable, particularly plenum wire and
cable and heat shrinkable tubing, can be fabricated by reducing the
crosslinking of the components of the polycondensation process.
Conventional insulation chemistry utilizes olefinic base materials
containing 6% carboxyl groups by weight, too high a percentage for
fabricating commercial grades of wire insulation.  Champlain
reduced the range of carboxyl groups to about 1% by weight of the
base material.

Champlain subjected the new formulations to electron beam
irradiation to improve the tensile strength, and to allow generally
higher loadings of the flame retardant additive.  Normally, when
greater amounts of filler materials are employed, the tensile
strength and elongation decrease.  Irradiation often improves
tensile strength, but had never been found to increase the
elongation.

It was shown that without the silanol groupings, the resultant
formulation does not demonstrate an increase in elongation after
irradiation. On the other hand, there is a synergy between the
chemistry of the Champlain product and the irradiation, in which
the combination of the two processes provides an increase in both
tensile strength, to 1,000-2,000 psi, and elongation, to 370-450%.

The hydroxyl-containing fire retardant filler used in the
insulation is normally magnesium hydroxide, but alumina trihydrate
may also be employed.  The formulation, which permits flame
retardant additive loadings three times as high as those in
conventional insulation, has greatly improved flame retardancy.
Oxygen indices of 42-72 have been achieved.  U.S. Patent RE35127,
a reissue of U.S. Patent 5,063,266, details the new Champlain Cable
work.

Ceramic Composite
Shaped for Furnaces

A new shaped ceramic composite material produced at 3M (St. Paul,
MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110) is intended for use in
applications requiring good heat resistance and mechanical
properties, such as gas fired radiant burner tubes, gas burner
nozzle liners, heat exchangers, thermowells, core busters or flame
dispersers and other gas fired furnace components.  Robert G. Smith
reports that the composite includes ceramic oxide fibers, a coating
of a carbonaceous matrix which includes boron nitride particles,
and a silicon carbide coating.

Radiant burner tubes are used in high temperature, corrosive
environments such as are found in industrial heat treating furnaces
and aluminum melting furnaces.  The three most common types of
commercially available radiant burner tubes are metal alloy, e.g.,
nickel-based superalloy, tubes; ceramic, e.g., silicon carbide,
monolith tubes; and ceramic composite, e.g., ceramic fibers and
ceramic cloth in a ceramic matrix, tubes.  The upper use
temperature of such tubes is typically 900-1260(C.

Although monolithic silicon carbide radiant burner tubes with an
upper use a temperature limit of about 1260(C are available, they
are generally brittle and prone to fail.  This is a common problem
of conventional shaped ceramic monoliths.  While it is possible to
select a conventional ceramic composite from which to prepare a
radiant burner tube which meets most of the requirements for use in
high temperature, chemically corrosive environments, it is only
possible by taking great care in the selection of materials and by
making some compromises in properties.

The carbon matrix or coating uses amorphous carbon and has a
thickness of up to one micrometer on an individual fiber.  The 3M
product includes 20-50% by weight ceramic oxide fibers, 0.2-20.0%
by weight carbonaceous matrix, 0.2-15.0% by weight boron nitride,
and 50-75% by weight silicon carbide.  U.S. Patent 5,476,684 was
assigned for this invention.

Zirconium Lowers
Smoke Generation

Flame retarded wool fibers with a zirconium-based finish are the
choice of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group (Pacific Highway S.,
Seattle, WA 98188; Tel: 206/394-3111) for use in decorative
applications in commercial aircraft, says the company's Sally A.
Hasselbrack.  Although the company is continuing to perfect these
materials, the zirconium materials have shown an outstanding
acceptance of dyestuffs, inherent resistance to burning, ease of
flame retardance, and great capacity to tolerate the wear and tear
of service in aircraft.

Hasselbrack credits the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
Regulation (FAR) 25, Appendix F, Part II with facilitating the new
flammability testing that will save many lives in post-crash fires.
The regulation uses a more realistic ignition source to initiate
combustion during simulations of post-crash fires.  It also
mandates retroactive coverage for the entire U.S. commercial air
fleet.  The Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft were the first to include
design guidelines stipulating the incorporation of materials with
limited smoke and toxic gas emission whenever possible.

Early technology for decorative fibers in aircraft interiors
incorporated the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fibers in the warp
and a phosphorus-based flame retardant finish on the wool filling
yarns.  Research performed at the Ilkley, West Yorkshire, U.K.-
based International Wool Secretariat (IWC) then led to a zirconium
and titanium compound-based Zirpro flame retarding finish for wool
fibers.

Requirements for textile products applied to vertical surfaces,
e.g., wall tapestries, are covered by FAR 25 amendments.  To meet
these requirements, tetrabromophthalic acid (TBPA) is used in
combination with the Zirpro treatment.  The success of this system
is due to the synergism between the zirconium finish, which works
in the solid phase, and the organobromine acid, which works in the
vapor phase.  The IWC, newly renamed Wools of New Zealand (WNZ),
recommends two forms of the TBPA compound: an emulsified paste with
a 40% bromine content, and a liquid form of disodium salt of
tetrabromophthalic anhydride with a 15% bromine content.

The utilization of TBPA is an essential part of Boeing's washable
wool program, the company's latest area of interest for flame
retarded wool.  When flame retardant washable wool first became
available, about 10 years ago, shrinkage after the first laundering
was 5-7%.  Shrinkage with subsequent launderings was minimal.
Since a strong correlation exists between dimensional stability and
abrasion, or wear resistance, Boeing did not initially use the
product.  As more Boeing 737s were sold to developing nations, the
company received an increasing number of requests for a washable
flame retardant product that would meet the shrinkage and
appearance requirements of the airline industry.  A new effort was
initiated to reduce shrinkage to 2% over 15 launderings.

The WNZ says that any type of shrink resistant process must be
compatible with the Zirpro process, because the Zirpro process is
the only existing flame retardant process for wool durable to
washing.  The organization's suggested techniques for the shrink
treatment of wool include a chlorine-based treatment applied to the
fiber in its worsted tops form, and to the woven, dyed fabric by a
padding process.  WNZ recommends that the weight of the fabric
should not fall below 11 ounces per square yard (oz/yd2) and that
only 100% wool fabrics should be used.  Both shrinkage and
appearance retention are improved by using a tightly woven fabric.
At 14 oz/yd2 the materials can withstand 19-20 launderings.

Lowering the Rate
of Heat Release

Helping furniture manufacturers produce upholstered furniture with
low rates of heat release is the intent of researchers at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg,
MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab (BFRL).  Thomas
Ohlemiller (Tel: 301/975-6481) of BFRL's Fire Science Div. finds
that the flammability of upholstered furniture continues to be a
substantial problem in both residential and public occupancies.

Both smoldering and flaming ignition problems exist.  The
smoldering problem, existing primarily in residences, is being
addressed through a voluntary industry program and by the
consideration of regulations covering cigarette ignition
propensity.  The flaming ignition problem and its consequences in
terms of heat release are being addressed in differing manners,
depending on the type of occupancy in the building in which the
furniture is used.  California Technical Bulletin 133 requires that
public occupancy furniture respond to an arson-like 18 kilowatt
(kW) igniter with a peak heat release rate of 80 kW.

This severe test has encouraged the development of barrier
technology, which involves a protective fabric layer in upholstery
between the foam and the outer layer of fabric.  Such technology is
believed to be cost effective since it is not meeting strong
industry resistance.  On the other hand, there are so many
variables in furniture design that only very large companies are
able to perform the large number of empirical tests needed to
ensure compliance across their product line.  This, coupled with
the technical attractiveness of barriers for controlling heat
release in any upholstered furniture, has prompted BFRL's ongoing
efforts to develop a quantitative understanding of the various
factors that control the heat release curve using mockups
containing various barrier fabrics.

In the study, BFRL will characterize the relationships between
small scale test data and full scale mockup behavior.  The focus is
on mockups containing a barrier fabric.  The results of related
work by the Association for Contract Textiles and the European
Community will also be considered.  After completing the barrier
effects of several fabrics in  a fixed mockup geometry, BFRL will
systematically vary the geometry.  This calls for a series of
mockups involving a very limited material selection, but wide
variations in seat, seatback and arm cushion dimensions.

Curable Printed
Circuit Boards

Curable flame retardant resins intended for use as the basic
material in printed circuit boards has been prepared by Gurit-Essex
(Papiermuhlestrasse 155, CH 3063 Ittigen-Bern, Switzerland; Tel: 31
580388) scientists.  Herbert Schriber, Gunter Burkart, and Bruno
Knaus report that the new formulation includes a thermally curable
1-oxa-3-aza tetraline group-containing compound, a curable epoxy
compound, and a flame retardant.  The flame retardant additive may
be aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, elemental red
phosphorus, oxygen acids of phosphorus, inorganic salts of oxygen
acids of phosphorus, polyphosphates, boric acid, or salts of boric
acid.

Although bromine-based flame retardant additives impart the
required flame retardance to resins used in the manufacture of
printed circuit boards, they can generate poisonous and/or
corrosive gases when exposed to fire.  As a result the Gurit-Essex
researchers sought a nonhalogenated alternative to flame retard the
resins.  U.S. Patent 5,443,911 explains the Gurit-Essex work in
detail.

Formulation Doesn't
Corrode Machinery

A new transparent, flame retardant, aromatic, polycarbonate resin
formulated by scientists at Teijin, Ltd. (1-11 Minamihonmachi,
Higashi-Ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6/268 2132, Fax: 6/266 1481)
does not corrode the molding machinery used to process the resin
into plastic components.  Masahiro Miyouga and Shinichi Souda
report that the new resin is highly transparent and includes 100
parts by weight of an aromatic polycarbonate resin, 0.01-1.00 part
by weight of a perfluoroalkane-sulfonic acid alkali salt and 0.02-
2.00 parts by weight of a halogenated triaryl phosphate flame
retardant in which at least one halogen atom is substituted on the
ring-forming carbon of each aromatic hydrocarbon group.

Aromatic polycarbonate resins have many excellent properties which
facilitate their widespread use, but they are also quite
combustible and require high loadings of flame retardant additives
when used in applications where flame retardancy is required.
Several conventional methods for imparting this flame retardancy
are used.

One is the incorporation of an organic halogen compound.  For
example, a polycarbonate oligomer obtained from tetrabromobisphenol
A as a dihydroxy component is often used in amounts that make the
bromine concentration in the final resin 5-15% by weight.  In
another instance, a carbonate copolymer obtained from
tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol A as dihydroxy components is
used in amounts to make the bromine concentration 5-9% by weight.
The problem is that when an aromatic polycarbonate resin containing
such a bromine-based flame retardant is molded or processed, the
machinery will most likely corrode.

Increasing the bromine concentration increases the corrosion.  The
goal of the Teijin researchers was to develop an aromatic
polycarbonate resin that would reduce corrosive tendencies, while
maintaining excellent flame retardancy.

One approach is the use of formulations that include 100 parts by
weight of a halogen-free conventional polycarbonate resin with a
molecular weight of 10,000-30,000, 5-60 parts by weight of a
halogen-free ultrahigh molecular-weight polycarbonate resin with a
molecular weight of 100,000-250,000 and 5-20% by weight of a flame
retardant.  The use of ultrahigh molecular weight resins is
expensive, though, and handling such materials is difficult.  In
addition, the resulting compositions have low transparency, and
their molding and processing characteristics are only mediocre.

Bromine-free flame retardants may also be used in conventional
molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate resins.  For example,
potassium perfluoroalkanesulfonate decreases the production of
corrosive gas, but, when used in high enough loadings to impart
sufficient flame retardancy, it decreases the heat stability of the
resin.

The Teijin breakthrough was the discovery that when potassium
perfluoroalkanesulfonate is combined with a small amount of
halogenated triaryl phosphate and incorporated into an aromatic
polycarbonate resin, the resin maintains its flame retardancy and
transparency can be retained, but corrosive tendencies are
decreased.  The perfluoroalkane-sulfonic acid alkali salt contains
an alkyl group with 1-8 carbon atoms, and the hydrogen atoms of the
alkyl group are replaced by fluorine atoms.  The alkali metal in
the salt is potassium or sodium.

Other examples of usable salts include potassium
perfluorobutanesulfonate and sodium perfluorooctanesulfonate. The
halogenated triaryl phosphate flame retardant must be free of
impurities such as salts and phosphate ester halides.  These
impurities cause turbidity and decreased transparency in the final
resin.  The Teijin work is more fully described in U.S. Patent
5,478,874.

New Encapsulant for
Semiconductor Devices

A new flame retardant epoxy molding compound, formulated by
researchers at Dexter Corp. (Franklin St., Olean, NY 14760; Tel:
716/372-6300, Fax: 716/372-6864), is intended for use in the
encapsulation of semiconductor devices.  Anthony A. Gallo reports
that epoxy resin compounds have often been used for encapsulation
of semiconductor devices such as integrated circuits (IC), large
scale integrated circuits (LSI), transistors, and diodes and other
electronic components.  Such encapsulants generally comprise an
epoxy, a hardener, a catalyst, a mold release agent, a filler, a
colorant, a coupling agent and a flame retardant system.

Conventional flame retardant epoxy molding compounds use systems
that can include halogenated compounds, transition metal oxides and
hydrated alumina.  The problem is that at high temperatures, these
flame retardant additives detract from the compatibility of the
encapsulant with semiconductor devices.  Other applicable flame
retardant systems include an organic phosphine compound and
antimony oxide; and antimony trioxide or antimony tetraoxide and
halogenated compounds.

Although these conventional flame retardant combinations provide
reasonable flame retardance and satisfactory compatibility on
electronic devices, the Dexter researchers believed that there was
a need for products with improved high temperature compatibility
and performance, and lower cost and toxicity.

The new Dexter formulation, detailed in U.S. Patent 5,476,716,
includes an epoxy, a novolac or anhydride type hardener, a
catalyst, a mold release agent, a filler, a colorant and a coupling
agent.  The flame retardant system includes a halogen-containing
organic compound, and either antimony pentoxide or magnesium oxide.
The halogen-containing organic compound may include either chlorine
or bromine.  Examples include polyglycidyl ether of
bromophenolformaldehyde novolac, halogenated bisphenol A and its
derivatives such as tetrabromobisphenol A, and glycidyl ethers of
halogenated resins such as the diglycidyl ether of
tetrabromobisphenol A.

3M Continues Quest
of Halon Alternatives

Omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ether compounds can be used as chemical fire
extinguishing agents in streaming applications, total flooding and
explosion suppression and inertion, report scientists at 3M (St.
Paul, MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110).  These chemicals are under
consideration as replacements in fire extinguishing applications
wherein applications where chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) or halons have been used.

Because of a steady flow of bad news about the damaged
stratospheric ozone layer, the deadlines for the end to
industrialized countries' production of CFCs and other ozone
depleting chemicals were accelerated by countries who are parties
to the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone
Layer.  Research has been initiated to replace all CFCs and halons,
such as CCl2F2, CCl3F, CF3Br and CCl2FCClF2, with substitute or
alternative compounds and technologies.

A number of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), e.g., CH2FCF3, or HFC-134a,
are being used or have been proposed as CFC substitutes.  HFC-134a
is more ozone friendly.  HCFCs, such as CH3CCl2F, or HCFC-141b, are
CFC substitutes, but although they are not nearly as damaging,
these substitutes do carry ozone depleting chlorine into the
stratosphere.  Another proposed substitute is the simple omega-
hydrodifluoromethyl perfluoromethyl ether (CF3OCF2H).

Omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ethers formulated by 3M are hydrophobic and
less oleophobic than the perfluoroalkyl ether analogs, chemically
inert, thermally stable, water insoluble and normally liquid at
20(C.  They can be produced in high yield and high purity and with
a wide range of molecular weights.  The covalent bond between the
omega-hydrogen and terminal carbon, i.e., the carbon-hydrogen bond,
is generally degradable by atmospheric photooxidation, making the
omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ethers environmentally acceptable.

3M's George G.I. Moore discloses that these normally liquid, omega-
hydrofluoroalkyl ether compounds (and some their mixtures) have a
saturated perfluoroaliphatic chain of carbon atoms interrupted by
one or more ether oxygen atoms.  The compounds can be prepared by
the decarboxylation of the corresponding fluoroalkyl ether
carboxylic acids.  U.S. Patent 5,476,974 details the 3M omega-
hydrofluoroalkyl ethers.

Testing the Limits
of Replacements

The lean flammability limit of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacement
refrigerants will be ascertained by a team of researchers at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg,
MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab (BFRL).  Carole
Womeldorf (Tel: 301/975-4415) of BFRL's Fire Science Div. reports
that hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-32 and a mixture of HFC-32 and HFC-125
are the refrigerants under study.  These materials are being
considered as replacements for ozone depleting CFCs.

A critical element in the risk analysis of alternative refrigerants
is the lean flammability limit.  Variations in the flammability
limit can occur, depending on the initial conditions chosen for
conducting the test.  There is a need to eliminate these variations
and to establish invariant, fundamental lean flammability limits
which can be attributed to refrigerant mixtures in a manner similar
to fundamental thermodynamic properties like enthalpy of formation
and adiabatic flame temperature.

BFRL will modify an existing burner facility to operate in a
symmetrical, adiabatic mode with independent control of the gaseous
refrigerant and air flows.  The burner will be calibrated using
methane to ensure that the facility is capable of reproducing the
published values of the lean flammability limit.  Stoichiometric
flames of HFC-32 and air will be examined.  The flow velocity will
be varied to establish the extinction strain rate and to identify
the dynamic range of the burner using a less flammable fuel.  The
fuel/air equivalence ratio will be varied about the stoichiometric
point, and the strain rate will be adjusted to identify the most
robust mixture (normally slightly rich for hydrocarbon flames).

The lean flammability limit of HFC-32 can be found using the zero
strain rate extrapolation method.  The critical flammability ratio
can be found by slowly increasing the fraction of HFC-125 in the
HFC/air mixture while maintaining the overall equivalence ratio and
strain rate, or by fixing the concentrations of all constituents
and slowly increasing the strain rate by reducing the spacing
between the upper and lower burners.

M.A. Hanna to
Acquire CIMCO

M.A. Hanna Co. (200 Public Square, Cleveland, OH 44114; Tel:
216/589-4000) has a preliminary agreement to acquire all of the
outstanding capital stock of CIMCO, Inc. (Briggs Ave., Costa Mesa,
CA 92626; Tel: 714/546-4460), a producer of thermoplastic compounds
and plastic components.  M.A. Hanna manufactures flame retardant
plastics, rubber and color and additive concentrates and
distributes plastic resins and engineered components.

The company, in a move that it says is "consistent with its
strategy of being an intermediary between the polymer producer and
end product manufacturer," intends to sell CIMCO's plastic
components business and retain the plastics compounding operations.
T. Russell Gilbert, president and CEO of CIMCO and CIMCO's largest
shareholder, says M.A. Hanna, will buy the molded components
business as a going concern shortly after completing the
acquisition of CIMCO is completed.  Gilbert owns 615,984 shares, or
21%, of the CIMCO shares outstanding.

CIMCO's plastics compounding businesses, which operate as
Compounding Technology, Inc. (CTI), are located in Singapore;
Corona, CA; and Charlotte, NC.  "The acquisition of CTI helps us on
three fronts to have a more balanced market profile," says Martin
D. Walker, M.A. Hanna chairman and CEO.  "First we will grow our
international business."  CTI provides M.A. Hanna with an excellent
basis for growth in Asia.

In fact, the operation in Singapore is CTI's largest.  CTI is also
in the process of expanding its production capabilities into
Europe.  Second, CTI's strong engineering plastics business will
add breadth to our specialty compounding portfolio throughout the
world.  Finally, we are able to build a stronger position in the
electrical, electronics and business machines markets."

States Adopt NFPA
Life Safety Code

Continuing their ongoing commitment to keeping citizens safer from
fire, officials in Alabama, Delaware, Maine, Maryland and Tennessee
have adopted the 1994 edition of the National Fire Protection Assn.
(NFPA, One Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269-9101) trademarked
Life Safety Code.  The Life Safety code, which provides basic
requirements for safety in buildings during emergencies, includes
provisions for building design, construction, operation and
maintenance to protect occupants from fire, smoke and toxic gases.

The latest edition of the code ensures that public safety
requirements are current and continue to be met.  NFPA works with
local authorities to help them implement code requirements and
encourages officials to adopt updated versions of its codes and
standards.

In the U.S., all health care facilities that receive Medicare or
Medicaid funding must comply with the Life Safety Code, according
to federal requirements.  To date, 33 states have adopted and
enforce the code, which requires that new and existing buildings
allow for "prompt escape" or that a means to provide people with a
reasonable degree of safety is considered.  Key provisions include
requirements that locks and hardware on doors must be installed to
permit free escape, exits must be marked by readily visible signs,
any door in a means of egress must be capable of swinging to the
open position to allow for the full use of the opening, and
evacuation signals must be audible and visible.

"Adoption and enforcement of state-of-the-art codes and standards
is a proven method for reducing fire loss," says NFPA president
George D. Miller.  "In some way virtually every building, process,
service, design and installation is affected by the codes and
standards developed through NFPA's open consensus codes- and
standards-making system."

Fire and Nonfire
Signals Differ

A better way to differentiate the patterns of fire and nonfire
signals using multiple sensors is the subject of a project at the
University of Maryland (College Park, MD 20742; Tel: 301/405-1000).
Thomas J. McAvoy reports that incorporating intelligence into a
fire detector so that it can recognize signature patterns is
intended to permit prompt fire detection, while allowing the
detector to discriminate between signatures from fire and nonfire
sources.  The primary purpose of this initial University of
Maryland work was to investigate the patterns of signatures
associated fire and environmental sources using small scale
experiments.

The scientists generated products from a wide range of conditions,
from flaming or pyrolyzing samples to heated samples and those
obtained with an atomizer.  They also measured gas concentrations,
light obscuration and temperature to characterize the products.  In
analyzing the data, they were able to identify trends from which an
elementary expert system can be built to identify the source of
airborne products.

McAvoy, writing in Fire and Technology, 31(2), reports that several
patterns were evident.  The maximum carbon dioxide (CO2)
concentrations achieved during experiments with flaming fires are
significantly greater than the maximum CO2 concentrations achieved
during experiments with nonflaming fires (pyrolyzing fires, heated
liquids and environmental odors).  The nonflaming sources can be
identified based on the carbon monoxide (CO) and metal oxide sensor
peak measurements.  Except for three experiments using pyrolyzing
solids, the peak CO concentration is greater--though the detector
response is less--for nonflaming fires than for environmental
sources.

The researchers built and tested an elementary neural network which
properly classified all fires except for one pyrolyzing event.
Based on this preliminary work, commercial fire detection systems
based on the analysis of airborne products appears feasible.
Additional research is needed to identify the optimum types and
number of sensors that should be coupled to provide prompt
detection between various sources.

Smoke and Dust
Particles Sensed

A smoke detector capable of sensing both smoke and fine particles
such as dust has been constructed by engineers at Hochiki Corp. (2-
10-43 Kamiosaki, Shinagawa-Ku, Tokyo, Japan; Tel: 3/444 4111, Fax:
3/447 1388).  Conventional  photoelectric analog smoke sensors
include a light emitting chamber and a light receiving chamber.
The light receiving chamber is placed in a position where it does
not directly receive light from the light emitting chamber.

Diffused light caused by smoke is detected in the light receiving
chamber, and a signal corresponding to the smoke density is
obtained.  A drive circuit for light emitting elements such as
light emitting diodes (LEDs) is located in the light emitting
chamber, and a light receiving signal amplifying circuit with an
element, such as a photodiode, is located in the light receiving
chamber.  When diffused light caused by smoke is detected by the
light receiving element, a signal at a level corresponding to the
smoke density is photoelectrically converted by the photodiode and
then amplified.  In this way, a conventional smoke detector obtains
the analog signal having output characteristics required by an
automatic fire notification system.

The problem is that in such an analog sensor, the integrated amount
of diffused light is detected.  As a result, only a small amount of
light is present in the area where the volume of fine particles
caused by a fire is small.  It is, therefore, not possible to
detect a very small amount of smoke generated in the initial period
of a fire.  Since fine particles such as dust cannot be detected by
the these sensors, it is not possible to distinguish dust and water
vapor from smoke, nor to distinguish environmental abnormalities
such as the contamination of the inside of the chamber at the same
time smoke is detected.

Atsushi Manmoto and Yukio Yamauchi report that the Hochiki detector
makes use of a light emitting device that projects a light beam
onto a monitor area.  A light receiving device is arranged so that
instead of receiving the light beam directly, it receives diffused
light caused by fine particles, i.e., dust or smoke, entering the
monitor area.  The output from the light receiving device is
amplified and counted and its average value per unit of time is
computed.  The result is that the signals caused by environmental
dust and smoke from fires can be differentiated, leading to a more
reliable instrument.  U.S. Patent 5,477,218 fully describes the
Hochiki work.

Checking Accuracy
of Fire Models

Researchers at Clemson University (Dept. of Mathematical Sciences,
Clemson, SC 29634-1907; Tel: 803/656-2616) have completed a
prototype sensitivity analysis capability for a fire model computer
program.  Their intent, reports Michael M. Kostreva, professor of
Mathematical Sciences, was to analyze the approach of the existing
HAZARD I fire model and to evaluate and demonstrate newly obtained
results on the mathematical foundations of fire models.

While HAZARD I is an established computer tool for modeling fires
in residential buildings, it lacks sensitivity analysis
capabilities.  Such a feature would allow users to better
understand the influence of certain input data on the computational
results.  This understanding could be translated into better use of
resources for gathering data and generally enhanced credibility of
the modeling results.  HAZARD I has successfully incorporated a
succession of increasingly complex fire models, including FAST,
CFAST and CONRAD 2.  A corresponding set of models equipped with
sensitivity analysis capabilities are needed.

Earlier approaches to fire model sensitivity analysis made use of
the simple ASET model.  The Clemson approach involved the ASET,
FAST, CFAST and CONRAD 2 models.  These include local methods of
finite difference type, along with the direct methods which use
some additional differential equations.  Global methods, which
involve averaging over a collection of preselected scenarios, were
not considered.

The results, relevant sets of input parameters and model outputs,
were accumulated in tabular form.  Examples of presently available
zone fire models have been assembled, along with the relevant
parameters for fires involving up to four rooms.  Kostreva found
that a limited sensitivity analysis, considering a carefully
selected subset of input parameters, is feasible, even for the more
complex models.  The graphical presentation of the results
facilitate a good quantitative understanding of the underlying
relationships.

MIT Simulates
Fire Plumes

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, Dept. of Mechanical
Engineering, Cambridge, MA 02139) scientists are building a
computationally-based large fire plume model in which buoyant fluid
mechanics, combustion, radiative transport and their mutual
interactions are all fundamentally represented using physically
sound approximations.  Ahmed F. Ghoniem (Tel: 617/253-2295) reports
that the approximations will be well resolved, both spatially and
temporally.  The model's computational efficiency, achieved by
simulating each of the processes, will allow the performance of
practical simulations on an advanced engineering workstation.

The simulation of fire plumes yielding burning rates, pollutant
formation rates and the radiation field is necessary as a tool for
the assessment of the environmental impact of large fires.
Computational modeling of these fires is complicated by the
presence of several complex physical processes, including
turbulence, transport and chemistry.  The wide range of physical
scales in these processes complicates their numerical modeling even
further.  The overall dynamics of the process is essentially
unsteady, and conventional numerical approaches could be very
expensive, since the domains of these fires are often extremely
large.

To overcome these difficulties, the MIT investigators are preparing
a computational model of fire plumes based on a simulation of all
of the significant physical processes involved.  They are employing
the vortex method to obtain solutions of some of the equations
involved, including the buoyancy and baroclinic terms, using
computational elements distributed along the layer separating the
plume (fuel and products) and the surrounding air and products in
the turbulent regime.

Mixing and combustion processes are simulated using the transport
element method in which only species concentration and temperature
gradients are computed, and only where vortex elements exist.  Fast
chemistry assumption is used in the computation of the burning
rate, temperature and major species distribution.  The
concentration of the computational elements within the narrow zone
of plume boundaries provides this approach with the necessary
efficiency.

An extensive validation study of both the isothermal plume and the
reacting plume models has been performed.  For the isothermal
plume, the relationship between the puffing frequency and the pool
diameter has been established and the results compared with
experimental data.  For the reacting case, they repeated the same
study and obtained good agreement with experimental data.

In both cases, they concluded that puffing is a buoyancy
instability formed at the base of the plume near the pool due to
the tendency of the rising plume to accelerate upward, thereby
reducing the plume diameter below that of the pool.  The conical
interface is subject to gravitational instability which leads to
the roll-up of the material interface and the concomitant puffing.
This puffing is responsible for the strong entrainment field into
the fire plume and the high upward penetration of the flames.

Ghoniem's team will next incorporate a soot formation model and a
liquid-gas interface boundary condition at the pool surface.  The
soot formation model is necessary for the computation of the
radiative transport fluxes, which contribute significantly to the
fuel evaporation and pyrolysis.  The liquid-gas interface condition
is intended to establish a physical basis for determining the
vaporization rate of the fuel.  A radiative-based transport
algorithm will also be constructed and incorporated.

Occupant and Fuel
Load Determined

A project at the University of Maryland (College Park, MD 20742;
Tel: 301/405-1000) is intended to provide a method for determining
the occupant load in a wide variety of both open plan and
compartmented office buildings for use in fire safety planning.
James A. Milke reports that the work will also determine how to
collect fuel load data for office spaces.  The problem is that
questions have been raised concerning the accuracy of currently
accepted occupant and fuel loads.  The subject arose after
preliminary studies were conducted in open plan and compartmented
office buildings.

The researchers first reviewed current occupant load survey
procedures and data collection forms.  In an occupant load
analysis, two parameters are needed: the number of building
occupants at any given time and the area of floor space.  The
approach is to count building occupants present during a survey
along with unoccupied workstations which appear to be occupied
under normal conditions.  Counting individuals not actually at
their workstations is an obvious source of inaccuracy.  In
addition, an improved methodology would account for guests or
visitors in a given building, along with people involved with
maintenance and custodial work and building contractors.  Most of
these individuals may be readily identified due to their different
working attire.

A preliminary version of a revised data collection form and
procedure was then prepared which reduces the obvious inaccuracies
in the conventional approach.  The new approach was then
successfully used to conduct occupant load surveys in public and
private sector office spaces in the metropolitan Washington, DC,
area.  The research team is now preparing their approach for
evaluating the fuel load evaluation which involves surveying office
spaces prepared for moving.  It is said to significantly simplify
the current procedure which includes weighing or estimating the
weight of the materials in office spaces.

(NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab
(BFRL).  Jeffrey Gilman (Tel: 301/975-6573) and Takashi Kashiwagi
(Tel: 301/975-6699), both of BFRL's Fire Science Div., will
determine the chemical structure of polymer residues generated
under well defined fire conditions for the purpose of determining
the links between original polymer structure, nonhalogenated
additives, char characteristics and flammability properties of
polymeric materials.

Two trends starting to significantly affect the U.S. plastics
industry are polymer recycling and a demand for nonhalogenated
flame retardant treatments.  The degradation products of polymers
flame retarded with halogenated additives are corrosive, and some
may be toxic.  One alternative approach to flame retarding polymers
is to form a char during burning.  This approach is ideal in that
carbon atoms retained in the condensed phase, as char, lessen the
available fuel for flaming combustion even as they help to insulate
the polymer from the heat of the flame.  Presently, though, there
is very little quantitative information about the relationship
between polymer structure, char properties, the effect of
nonhalogenated additives and realistic flammability properties.

BFRL will evaluate polymer/additive systems using its cone
calorimeter to find those with improved flammability behavior.
Preceramic polymer/organic polymer blends will be prepared and
evaluated.  The solid state decomposition chemistry of the
promising candidates will then be characterized, and samples at
intermediate stages of composition will be generated from the
preceramic/organic polymer blends in an inert flow pyrolysis
apparatus at many different temperatures.  Char yield,
aromatic/aliphatic ratio and crosslink density will be measured.

For higher heating rate conditions, the samples will be evaluated
under fire-like, nonoxidizing conditions in a gasification
apparatus which exposes large compression molded 100 gram disk
samples to a radiant heat source of 25-40 kilowatts per square
meter in a gaseous nitrogen atmosphere.  Gaseous degradation
products for the selected polymer samples.

BOOKS

International
Perspective

Fire Standards in the International Marketplace, published by the
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), offers a new
view of fire standards from an international perspective.  Leading
researchers in the field from France, England, and the U.S. have
presented material in three areas of concern.

First, the Test Method Development section covers the cone
calorimeter, including its development, standardization, and
future; three smoke test method evaluations; and a review and
comparison of ASTM and international fire standards.  The second
part of the book, International Aspects of Fire Standards, deals
with worldwide developments in fire safety engineering and
Eurocodes for structural fire designs.  Fire Performance in the
Real World, the volume's third section, covers fire resistance
testing controversies and the history, development, and future of
fire resistive joints.

The book, reports ASTM, is aimed at individuals and companies
concerned with the sale and flammability of products in the
international marketplace, researchers and testing personnel in the
fire standards professions, and fire regulatory officials.  Fire
Standards in the International Marketplace is available from the
ASTM (100 Barr Harbor Dr., W. Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959; Tel:
610/832-9585, Fax: 610/832-9555, email: service@local.astm.org).

STRATEGIES FOR COMPATIBILIZATION OF POLYMER BLENDS
[960101]

This (University of Texas) paper deals with strategies
for making polymer blends compatible.  The blending of
polymers offers attractive opportunities for achieving
unique property combinations and for improving
mechanical toughness, but it requires knowing how to
control interactions to achieve miscibility or phase-
separated blends with proper interfacial coupling.
Without controlled interactions, blends do not perform
as desired and some strategy for compatibilization is
necessary.  In order to obtain useful mechanical
properties, preformed block or graft copolymers may be
added to act as interfacial agents, or they may be
formed in situ by reaction of suitably chosen
functionalized polymeric components for control of
phase morphology and the interface between the phases.
(This 1991 conference paper was recently made available
as a reprint.)

BLENDING OF THERMOTROPIC LIQUID CRYSTALLINE POLYMERS
WITH THERMOPLASTICS [960102]

This work (by Virginia Polytechnic Institute) concerns
the optimization of the reinforcing effect provided by
liquid crystalline polymers (LCP) when combined with
thermoplastics.  The first phase of the research is
concerned with the generation of in situ composites
where the LCP fibrils are directly generated during
processing.  Because the formation of in situ
composites requires extensional deformation, the
fibrils are highly oriented in one direction, leading
to materials having highly anisotropic mechanical
properties.  Methods for reducing the mechanical
anisotropy of in situ composites are also studied.  The
desire to reduce the mechanical anisotropy leads to
pregeneration of LCP fibrils using a novel dual
extrusion technique.  The materials containing the
pregenerated microfibrils, referred to as
microcomposites, are then processed at temperatures
where the LCP fibrils are not melted, and the
mechanical   anisotropy of injection-molded
microcomposites is reduced.  The report covers research
concerned with the in situ composites, the process for
generating the microcomposites, and the results of the
processing studies.

FERROCENE POLYMERS HAVING POLYANILINE BACKBONES
[960103]

This (University of Pennsylvania) paper deals with
ferrocene polymers having polyaniline backbones.
Adding either aniline or m-phenylenediamine to one of
the cyclopentadienyl rings of ferrocene permits polymer
film formation by oxidative electropolymerization of
these side groups in acetonitrile solution.  The
monomers are prepared by reacting
N, N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene methiodide and the
appropriate amine in refluxing water.  A variety of
substituted aniline compounds have been synthesized to
demonstrate that polymer film formation most likely
occurs by a head-to-tail coupling of the aniline
moieties.  The electrochemistry of the
polymer-film-coated electrode in supporting electrolyte
only displays well-defined responses for the ferrocene
portion of the polymer, and is not complicated by
voltammetric responses of the supposed polyaniline
backbone.  These films are stable, with continuous
potential cycling showing less than 5% diminution in
the oxidative and reductive currents over 50 repetitive
scans.  (This 1991 journal paper was recently made
available as a reprint.)

STATUS OF RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND APPLICATIONS OF
BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS AND PLASTICS IN JAPAN [960104]

This (Loyola College) report concerns a fact-finding
team of American scientists and engineers that visited
Japan to assess the status of research and development
and applications involving biodegradable polymers.  The
team met with representatives of 31 universities,
government ministries and institutes, companies, and
associations.  Japan's national program on
biodegradable polymers and plastics evaluates new
technologies, testing methods, and potential markets
for biodegradables.  The program is coordinated by the
Biodegradable Plastics Society of Japan, which seeks to
achieve world leadership in biodegradable polymer
technology and identify commercial opportunities for
exploiting this technology.

The team saw no major new technology breakthroughs.
Japanese scientists and engineers are focusing on:
natural polymers from renewable resources; synthetic
polymers; and bacterially-produced polymers such as
polyhydroxyalkanoates, poly(amino acids), and
polysaccharides.  The major polymers receiving
attention are: the Zeneca PHBV copolymers; Biopol(tm);
poly(lactic acid) from several sources;
polycaprolactone; and the new synthetic polyester,
Bionolle(tm) from Showa High Polymer.  In their present
state of development, these polymers all have major
deficiencies that inhibit their acceptance for
large-scale applications.

THE KINETICS OF SOL-GEL SiO2 SYNTHESIS REACTIONS:
RECENT PROGRESS [960105]

This (University of Minnesota) paper deals with recent
progress in the study of the kinetics of sol-gel SiO2
synthesis reactions.  Sol-gel ceramic synthesis has
drawn much interest in recent years.  In production,
1-5 organometallic molecules, usually metal alkoxides,
are polymerized in an alcohol/water solution with
dissolved acids or bases to form a ceramic or glass
material having exquisite chemical and microstructural
control.  Since the chemistry and microstructure of the
solid determine its properties, this technology can be
used to design materials having specified mechanical,
optical, electronic, and physicochemical properties.
These  materials  may  be monoliths, films, fibers, or
powders.  Sol-gel synthesis offers a degree of control
of composition and structure at the molecular level
that is unachievable with traditional sintering or
precipitation methods.  It also offers an economical
alternative to layered vapor deposition manufacture of
coatings and fibers.  Owing to their controlled
chemistry and microstructure, sol-gel ceramics can be
densified at much lower temperatures than conventional
sintering temperatures, thereby saving energy and
protecting delicate structures in the material itself
or in its substrates.  The microstructure can also be
controlled to produce optical films, catalyst supports,
monolithic ceramic bodies, etc.  Since the precursor
molecules are pure and dissolved, atomic placement and
bonding can be controlled in order to `tune' the
mechanical/optical properties.

GELCASTING OF SINTERED REACTION-BONDED SILICON NITRIDE
[960106]

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) paper deals with
gelcasting of silicon metal for the production of
sintered reaction-bonded silicon nitride (SRBSN), which
is investigated in order to identify associated
advantages over conventional forming techniques (i.e.,
die and isostatic pressing).  Compacts are formed from
identical powder mixtures by both gelcasting and
pressing, and are nitrided and sintered to produce
SRBSN ceramics.  The characterization of the samples
include measurement of: green density; green and
nitrided pore structure; weight gain during
nitridation; final density; microstructure; toughness;
and flexural strength.  It is found that a more uniform
pore structure exists in the green gelcast samples, and
it is believed that this pore configuration aids in
nitridation and manifests itself in a more uniform
final microstructure.  In addition, improved mechanical
properties are achieved in the gelcast samples.  These
improvements are attributed to green microstructure
homogeneity.

BILATERAL U.S./RUSSIAN WORKSHOP ON SELF-PROPAGATING
HIGH-TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS PROCESSES [960107]

This (New York State College of Ceramics) report
summarizes the Bilateral US/Russian Workshop on
Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis
(Nov. 6-7, 1993, Honolulu, Hawaii).  The workshop
focused on both fundamental and applied aspects of the
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS)
process.  The goal was to identify and suggest
approaches to remedy the generally acknowledged gaps
that exist in our detailed quantitative understanding
of the essential chemistry and physics of the SHS
process.  The applied topics focussed on the rather
more practical aspects of the SHS process, in order to
help prioritize the fundamental studies in such a way
that our enhanced understanding leads to improved
SHS-based advanced materials fabrication methods.  The
two topic areas are, of course, interrelated:
fundamental studies can enhance commercialization
potential, and technological market-driven needs can
suggest important fundamental  science-driven studies.
The workshop allowed many of the world's key, presently
active, SHS researchers to discuss the state-of-the-art
and remaining work of SHS research, and to initiate
meaningful collaborative research projects between U.S.
and Russian scientists.

ORGANIC-INORGANIC COMPOSITES [960108]

One of the most important recent advances in the
ceramics area is the introduction of preparative
techniques heavily based on chemical reactions, for
example the generation of ceramic-type materials by the
hydrolysis of an organometallic compound.  A typical,
and important reaction of this type is the acid- or
base-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS): Si(OC2H5)4 + 2H2O ---> SiO2 + 4C2H5OH.  The
formed gel is dried to remove unreacted TEOS, ethanol,
water, and catalyst (which is generally chosen to be
volatile).  It is then fired into a porous ceramic,
which may then be densified into the final ceramic
object.

There are numerous advantages for generating ceramics
in this way, including: increased purity; lower
processing temperatures (permitting survival of organic
guest molecules); control of ultrastructure (at the
nanometer level); the possibility of adding a new
material to the pores prior to densification; and the
relative ease in preparing ceramic alloys.  This
(University of Cincinnati) paper present a review of
organic-inorganic composites, consisting in large part
of descriptions of how some of these ideas can be
extended using concepts from the area of polymer
chemistry.  The modifications are generally carried out
by having the polymer chains terminated with functional
groups that can participate in the ceramic-generating
reaction.  This permits intimate bonding between the
inorganic (ceramic) phase and the organic (polymer)
phase, in a way that is most likely to give novel
mechanical properties.

EVOLUTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS AND MODELS
[960110]

Risk, the all-encompassing four-letter word, became a
widely used household cliche and an institutional
mantra in the nineties.  Risk analysis models have made
a number of sharp paradigm shifts to evolve itself as a
decision-making tool from individual risk perception to
societal risk-based regulatory media.  Risk always
coexists with benefit and is arbitrated by costs.
Risk-benefit analysis has been in use in business and
industry in economic ventures for a long time.  Only
recently, risk management in its current state of
development evolved as a regulatory tool for
controlling large technological systems that have
potential impacts on the health and safety of the
public and on the sustainability of the ecology and the
environment.

This (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) paper
summarizes the evolution of risk management concepts
and models in industry and the regulatory agencies in
the U.S. over the last three decades.  It also
discusses the benefits and limitations of this evolving
discipline as it is applied to high-risk technologies,
from the nuclear power plant and petrochemical
industry, etc., to nuclear weapons technology.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO ELEMENTAL IMAGING IN 3-DIMENSIONS
[960113]

This (Sandia National Laboratories) report concerns the
feasibility of a radically different method of using
x-ray excited x-ray fluorescence to perform two- and
three-dimensional elemental imaging at the
micrometer-size scale.  The proposed new approach is
investigated using both laboratory and synchrotron
x-ray sources.   Investigations center around the use
of two different types of monochromators and a CCD
detector, to allow the imaging of characteristic
excited x-radiation in two dimensions, one element at a
time.  The goal of this approach is to be able to
obtain three-dimensional images in a similar way as is
now possible using x-ray tomographic microscopy
methods.  Unfortunately, after considerable research it
was not possible to obtain sufficient signal using
either x-ray source, and the project was terminated.
However, it is possible that the advent of more intense
synchrotron x-ray sources could allow this technique to
be used for certain restricted applications.  The
results obtained here indicate that, without some
further breakthrough, it is unlikely that a practical
instrument could result from this approach.

ANALYSIS OF PARTICLE FILTRATION USING THE METHOD OF
VOLUME AVERAGING [960114]

This (University of California) report presents and
discusses analysis of the process of filtration of
non-charged submicron particles, using the method of
volume averaging.  The particle continuity equation is
represented in terms of the first correction to the
Smoluchowski equation that takes into account particle
inertia effects for small Stokes numbers.  This leads
to a cellular efficiency that contains a minimum in the
efficiency as a function of the particle size, and this
allows identification of the most penetrating particle
size.  Comparison of the theory with results from
Brownian dynamics indicates that the first correction
to the Smoluchowski equation gives reasonable results
in terms of both the cellular efficiency and the most
penetrating particle size.  However, the results for
larger particles clearly indicate the need to extend
the Smoluchowski equation to include higher order
corrections.  Comparison of the theory with laboratory
experiments, in the absence of adjustable parameters,
provides interesting agreement for particle diameters
that are equal to or less than the diameter of the most
penetrating particle.

BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSING OF GEOTHERMAL BRINES AND SLUDGES
[960115]

Development of cost-efficient biochemical processes for
the treatment of geothermal brines and sludges has led
to the identification of several options that allow the
conversion of geothermal wastes into useful products.
A laboratory-scale pilot plant operating in a batch
mode has been constructed and used to extract and
recover toxic and valuable metals and metal salts from
geothermal residues.  Metal extraction and recovery
efficiencies of better than 80% per 5-25 hour treatment
cycles are achieved.  The new technology is versatile
and can be applied to brines and sludges derived from
hypersaline as well as low salinity resources.  The
biochemical processes: can be integrated with existing
facilities; allow recycling options; and yield revenue
generating feedstocks and waste volume reduction.
Selected versions of this technology are now being
readied for field trials.  This paper (from Brookhaven
National Laboratory) presents and discusses recent
advances and the current status of this emerging new
technology.

NANOSCALE METALLIC MULTILAYERS [960122]

This (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) paper
concerns the development of nanoscale multilayer
structures, which is being driven by a wide range of
commercial applications that require enhanced material
behaviors.  Innovations in physical vapor deposition
technologies, in particular magnetron sputtering, have
enabled the synthesis of metallic-based structures
having nanoscaled layer dimensions as small as
one-to-two monolayers.  The parameters used in the
deposition process are paramount to the formation of
these small layer dimensions and the stability of the
structure.  Therefore, optimization of the desired
material properties must be related to assessment of
the actual microstructure.  Characterization techniques
such as x-ray diffraction and high resolution
microscopy are useful to reveal the interface and layer
structure, whether ordered or disordered, crystalline,
amorphous, compostionally abrupt or graded, and/or
lattice strained.  The paper emphasizes experimental
studies of mechanical properties, and reviews
techniques for synthesis of metallic multilayers having
subnanometric layers, with applications based on
enhancing such material behaviors as reflectivity and
magnetic anisotropy.

PROCESSES FOR MAKING HIGH-RESOLUTION LARGE-SCALE
MEASUREMENTS [960124]

This (Wright Laboratory) report deals with
high-resolution large-scale measurements.  As spatial
resolution of any measurement process increases, the
amount of data per unit area (or volume) increases.
This leads to huge amounts of data and/or long
measurement times when attempting to map small spatial
variations in material properties over large spatial
dimensions.  It is, therefore, desirable to develop
techniques so that high-resolution information can be
obtained while maintaining the ability to cover large
areas without being overwhelmed by measurement time or
data.  The report discusses the issues involved, and
seeks to formulate and advocate strategies that could
guide such endeavors.

surfaces, and is generally regarded to be
nondestructive to most inorganic materials although the
electrical properties of the sample are usually
altered.  This (Vanderbilt University) paper discusses
recently developed scattering techniques, using
time-of-flight particle detection, that work well with
ions whose energies are at least an order of magnitude
lower than those required for conventional analyses.
This reduction in the ion beam energy makes possible
novel measurements, such as characterization of thin
films on polymer substrates, and enhanced capabilities
such as improved sensitivity for trace element
detection.  The energy resolution of the time of flight
detector has made possible thin film thickness
measurements on semiconductors and optical devices.

OPTIMAL CONTROL OF MOLECULAR MOTION USING TAILOR-MADE
OPTICAL FIELDS [960127]

The overall objective of this (Princeton University)
research is to establish the physical principles for
achieving control over molecular motion through the
introduction of tailor-made optical fields.  The effort
involves basic theoretical developments as well as
selected applications.  Emphasis is given to
establishing the robustness of laser field designs to
various inevitable uncertainties and errors that may
arise.  An entirely new algorithm, based on quantum
mechanical tracking, is introduced as a basis for a
comprehensive treatment for molecular control, as well
as the inversion of controlled dynamics to learn about
the underlying Hamiltonians.  A fundamental
controllability algorithm is established that can
assess whether it is feasible to reach acceptable
degrees of control in any particular molecule.

USING LASERS IN MICROELECTRONIC AND MICROMECHANIC
FABRICATION [960128]

This (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) report
concerns the application of lasers to microelectronic
and micromechanic fabrication.  Over the last few
years, vigorous research activity has been directed to
laser processing for microfabrication.  The new
techniques that have emerged are motivated by
possibilities ranging from achievement of a 0.15 micron
optical lithography, to development of entirely
nonlithographic laser direct writing methods for
circuit prototyping and postfabrication (final step)
processing.  The technology is poised as a simpler,
faster, and less expensive alternative to x-ray,
electron, or ion-beam lithography for fabricating next
generation VLSI.  It would make methods available for
interactive circuit design, multichip modules, and 3-D
micromechanics.

A NOVEL NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION TECHNIQUE USING
PULSED ULTRASOUND AND NEURAL NETWORKS [960132]

A novel nondestructive evaluation technique that uses
the spectral signature of a pulsed ultrasound signal to
identify metals had recently been abandoned because of
the difficulty in interpreting the results.
Traditional analysis was inconvenient to apply to this
type of problem because of the complicated, noisy, and
incomplete nature of the data.  This (Army Armament
Research, Development, and Engineering Center) report
details the application of neural networks to the
technique, to provide a radically different approach to
computation.  These massively parallel neural network
systems provide a mechanism to extract pertinent
information from input data while maintaining a high
degree of fault tolerance.  The report discusses the
design of a neural network system capable of accepting
data from nondestructive test equipment and producing
output relative to the quality of the sample being
tested.

SCANNING X-RAY DIFFRACTION: A TECHNIQUE FOR STUDYING
PHASE FORMATION IN CO-DEPOSITED THIN FILMS [960134]

Investigating the formation of new metastable phases in
alloy thin films requires ways of quickly determining
the crystalline structure of samples having different
compositions.  This (Argonne National Laboratory) paper
presents a novel technique for acquiring structural
information from films intentionally grown with a
composition gradient.  Binary metal alloy films are
deposited using a phase-spread sputtering method.
Using a narrow incident x-ray beam and a translating
sample stage, combined with a position-sensitive x-ray
detector technique, detailed information on the
metastable phase diagram is rapidly obtained.  Results
from studies of phase formation in Zr-Ta alloys are
presented, and extensions of the analysis technique to
ternary systems are discussed.

THE DEFORMATION OF THIN LUBRICANT FILMS [960135]

This (Georgia Institute of Technology) report concerns
boundary lubrication, elastohydrodynamic lubrication,
and the dependency of the friction coefficient upon
load and sliding velocity.  The coefficient of friction
in concentrated contact is often dealt with as a
disposable parameter in numerical analyses.  Boundary
and elastohydrodynamic lubrication have been recognized
as separate regimes of concentrated contact lubrication
since the EHD solution of Ertel-Grubin.  Delineation of
these regimes is nearly always based on the magnitude
of the film thickness relative to surface roughness,
rather than a transition in friction.

ADVANCED POLYMER-MATRIX COMPOSITES: CHARACTERIZATION OF
NONLINEAR BEHAVIOR [960136]

Due to the presence of curing stresses and oriented
crystalline structures in the matrix of polymer-matrix
fiber composites, the in situ nonlinear properties of
the matrix are expected to be different from those of
the bulk resin.  This (NASA) report discusses a plane
stress micromechanical model to retrieve the in situ
elastic-plastic properties of (Narmco 5260 and Amoco
8320) matrices from the measured elastic-plastic
properties of (IM7/5260 and IM7/8320) advance
composites.  In the micromechanical model, the fiber is
assumed to be orthotropically elastic and the matrix to
be orthotropic in elastic and plastic properties.

LIGHTWEIGHT TITANIUM-BASE ALLOYS [960138]

This (McDonnell Douglas Research Laboratories) report
concerns the development of new titanium alloys having
10% lower density, 50% higher elastic moduli, and 50%
higher strength than Ti-6Al-4V, and a 150 C increase in
service temperature above that of Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo.
The feasibility of adding significant amounts of Be,
Li, and Mg to Ti-base alloys to effect these
improvements is discussed.  Rapid solidification
processing is employed to obtain extended solid
solutions of Be concentrations far exceeding the limits
indicated by the equilibrium phase diagram.  Master
alloys of Ti-Al-Be and Ti-V-Al-Be are produced by
melting pieces of Lockalloy (60 wt% Be-40 wt% Al) and
elemental additions, in a BeO-wash-coated alumina
crucible, and casting at 1450 C into a chilled mold.
Powder is produced by melting the master alloys in an
uncoated graphite crucible, initiating metal flow at
1300 C, and dispersing the stream by centrifugal
atomization.  (This 1989 report was only recently
released for public use.)

WELCOME TO YOUR FIRST ISSUE OF INSIDE NIST!  

     We believe you will find INSIDE NIST an indispensable tool and an
important resource as you do business with this exciting agency. While
NIST is undergoing some budget challenges, its core programs remain as
vital as ever.  Rep. Robert Walker (R-Pa.), a major budget player who
oversees NIST funds in the House of Representatives, has made a
commitment to the continued growth of the core programs.  While it is
still too early to tell definitively, it also looks as though the
Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Malcolm Baldrige Award will
move forward and grow.  Questions still remain about the fate of the
Advanced Technology Program, however, and INSIDE NIST will keep you
posted on all new developments.
     Our mission with INSIDE NIST is to provide you with the inside
track on how to win more contracts from NIST's programs, and on how to
profit from its ongoing standards development.  We want you to use
INSIDE NIST as your "inside source" for the activities of this dynamic
agency.  
     Now, here's the news:

ATP FUNDS ZEROED OUT OF FISCAL 1996 HOUSE MONEY BILL

     NIST's Advanced Technology Program (ATP) will not receive federal
funding beginning Oct. 1, according to legislation approved by the
House Appropriations Commerce Subcommittee.  ATP funding had ramped up
to $340 million in the current fiscal year.  In attempting to kill the
program, the subcommittee said such funds should more appropriately
come from private industry. 
     Zeroing out ATP accounted for most of the reduction in funds NIST
will suffer in fiscal 1996 if the House bill is approved.  Funds would
be slashed from $763.8 million to $404 million.  Every other NIST
initiative, including the core programs (known as the Scientific and
Technical Research Services or STRS), the Manufacturing Extension
Partnership (MEP) and the Malcolm Baldrige Award, apparently will
advance.                                                              
     NIST continues to promote ATP to industry, even though NIST
officials know that ATP funding could be eliminated.  (See related
story, p. 5.)  A revised ATP competition has a solicitation deadline
of Sept. 12, less than three weeks before all ATP funds are set to
expire.  A NIST official told us the Congres-sional budget process is
of long duration and that ATP funds could yet be reinstated. 
     ATP funds amounting to $187 million that were not used in fiscal
1994 may be used to help close out ATP initiatives begun before Oct.
1, 1994.  ATP programs begun after that date may not receive any
additional funds.  
     Commerce Secretary Ron Brown reacted angrily to the news of ATP's
demise in the bill by noting that the elimination of ATP "is
unacceptable."  Brown also expressed unhappiness about "deep
reductions" in NIST funding, although a House Appropriations
Subcommittee staff member said funding would be about the same in
fiscal 1996 as in fiscal 1995.  A NIST official said his understanding
was that the mark would be reduced from $90.6 million to about $81
million.
     There was no mention of Baldrige Award funding in the
appropriations bill but NIST officials are confident it will be
included as part of STRS.  If that is the case, the NIST breakout in
fiscal 1996 is as follows: $263 million (NIST Labs including
Baldrige), $81 million for MEP and $60.1 million for construc-
tion/renovation of NIST research facilities.

CRIPPLING RESCISSION BILL NOW EXPECTED TO BECOME LAW   

     A rescission bill that knocks back NIST funds in a variety of
areas in the current fiscal year now is expected to be signed into law
by President Clinton in the near future.  Clinton earlier had vetoed
the measure for reasons unrelated to NIST program funding.
     The cutbacks include $17 million for NIST's Scientific and
Technical Research Services (STRS), $15.7 million for the
Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and $30 million for the
construction/renovation program.
     The cutbacks would detrimentally impact a NIST solicitation
issued June 8 for non-profit agencies to submit proposals for new MEP
centers.  NIST had promised $41 million for such proposals.  The
number of centers and funding will now be cut back as the result of
the rescission, according to NIST spokesman Mike Newman.     
     "[This legislation] hurts our move to make the labs self-funded,
not to be as dependent on outside funding," according to Newman.  In
the past, a good portion of funding has come from other federal
agencies. 
     "We want to take the lead in technical emphasis on activities at
our lab," concurred NIST spokesman Mat Heyman.  Such outside emphasis
"skews your operation," continued Heyman.  "The [other funding agency]
does what it wants with [the results]."
     Funding for the construction program would almost be halved, from
$64 million to $34 million.  "Priorities are going to have to be
shifted quite a bit," the spokesman said.  "It's pretty drastic."
     The House already has passed the revised rescission measure but
the Senate has yet to act.  However, the Senate is expected to approve
the bill after it returns from the July 4 congressional recess.
     The Appropriations Subcommittee markup actually represents a
reprieve for MEP.  The House Science Committee approved legislation
that does not include ATP or MEP.  An amendment to that legislation,
which was approved by the full committee last week, would not preclude
funds for ATP and MEP.  (While actual funds come through the
appropriations process, the new Republican Congress is attempting to
address authorizing bill concerns in that process.)

  ...Morella Guards Core Programs at Expense of ATP and MEP

     Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.), whose district includes NIST-
Gaithersburg, authorized legislation June 15 that would allow $273
million to go to STRS and Baldrige.  She rightly indicated at that
time that the appropriators may add funds for MEP.  It is interesting
to note that the programs Morella did not include funding for were
those that would have the least impact on jobs in her own district.
     In fact, the agency thinks it can make the cuts without loss of
jobs, according to Newman, although he acknowledged that staff
cutbacks do constitute "one possibility."  One unwanted but necessary
remedy may be furloughs to keep costs down and jobs intact.      
     Morella claimed that her hands were tied as the result of a
budget resolution.  In order for the authorizing committee to have any
impact on the appropriations committee mark-up, it would have to fall
within those caps, she told the subcommittee. 
     "If it were possible, I think you all know that my preference
would be to fully fund every NIST function," Morella said.  "However,
given our commitment to balance the budget, that simply cannot be the
reality."
     "We do not have the budget to fund ATP and MEP, in addition to
the core scientific work being done at the NIST laboratories," Morella
intoned.  "NIST core programs must be a priority." 
     Associated with saving STRS is continuation of a strong lab
construction and renovation program, according to Morella.  "Without
the necessary renovation and construction of facilities, NIST will
simply not be able to adequately fulfill its basic mission in the
future," she said. 
     Democrats on the Science Subcommittee bitterly fought the
legislation.  Rep. John Tanner (D-Tenn.), ranking minority member,
offered an amendment that would have increased funds to $754.2
million.  That was defeated by a vote breaking down along party lines. 
Tanner's amendment would have approved $330 million for ATP and
bolstered funding for MEP to $130.6 million. 
     The Appropriations Subcommittee did not have specific breakouts
by NIST labs, according to a staffer there.  Morella's authorizing
subcommittee included the following figures: 

     *  Electronics and Electrical Engineering Lab ($39.6 million); 
     *  Manufacturing Engineering ($19.6 million); 
     *  Chemical Science and Technology ($28.1 million); 
     *  Physics ($28.1 million); 
     *  Material Science and Engineering ($54.3 million); 
     *  Building and Fire Research ($13.5 million); 
     *  Computer Systems ($30.7 million); 
     *  Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing ($11 million); 
     *  Technical Assistance ($19.1 million); and 
     *  Research Support ($28.2 million).     

     The Morella legislation also would allow for the expansion of
NIST's Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT) from 9 to 15
members; authorize a NIST metro shuttle; increase the cap on the NIST
postdoctoral fellows program; give excess scientific equipment to
secondary schools; raise the cap on the 
number of winners of the Baldrige quality awards from two to four; and
allow NIST to extend its Personnel Demonstration Project.
     The full House Appropriations Committee is expected to meet July
11, followed by a full House vote.  The process then begins in the
Senate, followed by conferencing the two bills.
     NIST officials believe there will be more of a fight in the
Senate to restore some funds for ATP.  Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.)
has said he will fight for both ATP and MEP.  No Republican senator is
yet on record as supporting either program, however, a NIST official
acknowledged.
     ATP was originally slated for elimination in the Republican
Party's Contract with America.  Rep. Robert Walker (R-Pa.), chairman
of the House Science Committee and vice-chairman of the House Budget
Committee, has threatened to kill ATP from the beginning of the
congressional term.

  ...Unfavorable GAO Report Further Hurts ATP's Efforts

     These efforts were further boosted by a General Accounting Office
(GAO) report originally commissioned and released June 15 by former
House Science Committee Chairman Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.) which
says that attempts to measure the success of ATP are not accurately
stated.  NIST officials have attempted to show that ATP is already
paying dividends for the American taxpayer as an argument to continue
the program.   
     GAO charged that NIST incorrectly overstated the results.  In
four instances, it found, results were overstated or lacked adequate
support.  Walker charged that "one can open up nearly any page of the
GAO report and find evidence that Advanced Technology Program is
exactly the wrong way to advance U.S. competitiveness." 
     The action on ATP comes following efforts to rally support for
the program among involved industries.  Brown has actively called for
business--particularly the small business community--to lobby for the
program.

BOULDER GIVEN BACK-OF-THE-BUS STATUS ON CONSTRUCTION/RENOVATION PLANS

     The original construction and renovation plans for NIST talked of
equally helping the Gaithersburg, Md., and Boulder, Colo., campuses,
but as money becomes more of an issue it is clear that the
Gaithersburg headquarters, which is in Rep. Connie Morella's (D-Md.)
home district, is first among equals.
     "One hundred percent of our efforts are going to Gaithersburg in
fiscal years 1995 and 1996," NIST Associate Director Samuel Kramer
said at a recent briefing on the plans, which falls under the rubric
Capital Improvements Facilities Program (CIFP).  
     That is despite the fact that Boulder labs are as old or in some
cases older than the Gaithersburg facilities.  Like Gaithersburg,
Boulder is slated to have a state-of-the-art Advanced Technology Lab
(ATL) built on its campus.
     Despite the similarity of the ATL name to NIST's Advanced
Technology Program (ATP), Kramer attempted to distance the new lab
from the technology program, whose funding is now being threatened. 
     "They are two different things," Kramer said.  "The ATL is an
intramural research program which will address the core activities of
the Lab."  In contrast, the ATP "is an extramural program which has a
separate mission."
     The Gaithersburg ATL, costing from $115 million-$130 million,
will be "the world's most advanced technology lab," Kramer said.  "We
have looked at labs throughout the world, and this facility will be
the best," he told the briefing.
     The new Gaithersburg ATL will be over 31,000 gross square meters. 
The facility will be only one story high.  The metrology labs will
exist underground.  Due to budget considerations, NIST had to adjust
its original estimate for the program downward from more than $1
billion to $540 million.  "We had to cut the budget request to address
early technical obsolescence," Kramer said.

  ...Disruption To Be a Key Concern

     There will be disruption as the result of the construction at the
NIST Gaithersburg campus, and the agency already has made plans to
rent nearby space, known as "NIST North," to accommodate displaced
employees.  Jorge Urrutia, NIST director of administration, told us
there are plans for as many as 540 displacements, but noted that it is
unclear exactly how many will be impacted.
     For example, the Physics Lab, where sensitive experiments are
undertaken, is located next to a major construction area.  "We are
asking [the construction crew] not to do certain things at certain
times--such as drive piles or use earth-moving equipment--but there is
no doubt there will be a loss of productivity in these areas," Urrutia
said.
     At a facility where subatomic particles are measured, it is
unclear how well clean rooms will be able to operate during
construction.  Vibration will also no doubt constitute a major
problem.
     An Advanced Chemical Sciences Lab (ACSL) also is being
constructed as part of the program.  Construction is set to begin in
June 1996, with occupancy expected in May 1998.  With regard to ATL,
construction also is expected to begin next June, with occupancy by
October 1999.  Both schedules may be impacted by budget reductions.
     The existing chemistry lab, which Kramer said has deteriorated
faster than other campus facilities, will be renovated at some point,
although Kramer said it is not a priority item.
     NIST now is building a materials processing lab, largely to
recycle material, at a cost of approximately $1 million.

FAILING ATP CIME PROGRAM REEMERGES AS TIMA

   A former NIST ATP focus program that yielded only one award in
response to its first solicitation has been recast and rebid. 
Technologies for the Integration of Manufacturing Applications (TIMA)
has replaced Computer-Integrated Manufacturing for Electronics (CIME).
     A Proposer's Conference on TIMA held June 20 at NIST-
Gaithersburg's Green Auditorium stated the new technical goal is
"creating a cost-effective, plug-&-play real-time manufacturing
execution software environment for discrete manufacturing."  Sought-
after characteristics include integratability, configurability,
adaptability, extensibility and reliability.
     NIST officials say that a particular emphasis will be on
Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), which bridge the gap between
high-level management systems and factory-floor-control systems.  MES
applications link business and manufacturing systems, tracking a job
on the shop floor in near-real time.
     A total of $18 million in current-year funding is available to
fund the first TIMA awards, according to NIST officials.  Full project
proposals are due Sept. 12.
     A variety of flaws were cited among the proposals that originally
were submitted to receive CIME funding, according to a paper released
last month by NIST's Amy Knutilla (knutilla+cme.nist.gov).  Of the
original 15 proposals, representatives from six proposals were invited
to NIST for oral review.  Those boiled down to only one award.
     "There were no major trends in strengths or weaknesses of the
proposals," said Knutilla.  Were the results consistent with other ATP
proposals, the failure would have come in the original
conceptualization of the idea or in the too-harsh evaluation of the
proposals, one source observed.
     However, Knutilla also found that "most of the proposals made
only a high-level, cursory attempt to address some of the ATP
criteria, with some proposals completely neglecting some criteria." 
Other damning features included "excessive use of industry buzzwords,"
"low technical risk," the naming of partners without commitments from
those partners, providing "an unclear discussion on the potential
technical leverage of [the] proposal," lack of a management plan, and 
little experience with CIME. (For more information, contact Barbara
Goldstein at 301/975-2304 or e-mail to goldstein+eeel.nist.gov)

NIST SPOKESMAN: CLASSIFIED AREAS FEW 

   NIST officials denied pervasive rumors that the agency still
derives a significant amount of its budget to perform classified
activity.
     There is almost nothing being done in the classified area,
according to NIST Public Affairs Director Mat Heyman.
     "There are probably a few, but there are probably only a very few
[classified activities]," qualified NIST spokesman Mike Newman.  He
would not go further.
     Both reacted with some anger to a report that linked NIST Deputy
Director Ray Kammer to a large classified program undertaken with the
National Security Agency (NSA).  While Heyman acknowledged that NIST
was involved with classified parts of Clipper Chip, an NSA program, he
said the overall impact when compared to other NIST activities is
"very tiny."
     When asked if "a fair amount" of activities at NIST are
classified, Newman responded, "That's garbage.  There may be some
projects that we are doing with the military that may have some
classified elements, but most of the research area is unclassified."

UNDERSTANDING METALLIC DENDRITES STIMULATES NIST RESEARCHERS

   NIST metallurgists housed on the first floor of the Materials
Building in Gaithersburg are gaining insight into dendrites, literally
"tree-like" forms created when metals become solidified. 
     Dr. William Boettinger showed INSIDE NIST editor C. David Chaffee
some of the metallic formations under microscope at his lab recently. 
Such studies are serving as the building blocks of metallic alloys
that can have any number of extreme properties.  One is an engine
turbine that only will melt at about 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
     Boettinger observes that dendrites also are common in snowflakes
and in ceramics.  They have a freezing or solidification point well
above that of water and often do not have a liquid phase.  Thus, they
can remain in "frozen" form to thousands of degrees Fahrenheit.  "When
people think of something in freezing terms, they think of water,"
Boettinger tells us.  "The metallurgist does not think of freezing in
those terms."
     When asked what eventual practical applications the understanding
of these patterns will have, Boettinger notes, "At this point, it's
like trying to tell a skier that patterns on each of the snowflakes on
his lift are important." However, skiers do understand that snow can
come in different forms, such as light powders and heavy, wet snow. 
     Boettinger has joined with James Warren, a NIST physicist, to
study the transition of these metals from vapor or liquid to solid. 
Controlling this solidification is a fundamental goal of the
metallurgist.  The two men are working to further describe this
simulation using computer equipment.
     The alloy that Boettinger demonstrated under the microscope had
white spots that he said are regions of high concentration of
impurities.  These white spots are brittle particles that can lead to
premature failure of the casting.
     Specifically, Warren and Boettinger developed a comprehensive
phase-field model for solving heat and solute diffusion equations
during solidification that avoids tracking the liquid-solid interface. 
Their work has been written up in Nature and Computational Science &
Engineering.   

     More Inside The Corridors items:
     Appropriate for the Fourth of July, NIST's Gaithersburg library
was displaying how NIST scientists helped to preserve and restore the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  The original
documents had been deteriorating before they were able to turn things
around.  The library now sports a "Welcome to the Virtual NIST
Library" computer screen to entrants, upon which a widescreen home
page of the NIST virtual library is displayed.

     Much of last month's Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology
(VCAT) meeting in Boulder had to do with the recently completed
Delivering Results, a testimonial from industry on NIST programs.  A
meeting discussion point was how NIST is tracking the effectiveness of
its programs.  Now chaired by Bob Hermann of United Technologies, VCAT
represented a "routine review of what we are doing," according to NIST
Public Affairs Director Mat Heyman.  Most of NIST Director Arati
Prabhakar's presentation dealt with the budget situation.  Biotech
Professor George Whitesides of Harvard University made a presentation
and NIST officials tried to see what similarities are ongoing between
his program and that of NIST.  A tour of NIST-Boulder's physics lab
was included.

STATE PROGRAMS BLAMED FOR DIMINISHED BALDRIGE INTEREST

    The Malcolm Baldrige Award program is receiving a lower number of
applications than it has in the past in part because it is now
"competing with state, local and regional programs that have sprung up
[which are] based on the Baldrige Award," according to NIST spokesman
Mike Newman.  "People are competing for [the state] awards first
before they go to Baldrige," he added.
     Companies are also more likely now to be preoccupied with other
things--such as satisfying International Standards Organization
standards and competing abroad.  "They are still interested in
improving their quality, but they are not specifically looking to
apply for the Baldrige Award," Newman said.
     The spokesman observed that the agency continues to mail hundreds
of thousands of criteria for the Baldrige Award.
     Approximately 30 states have established state quality awards
programs, most of which are modeled after the Baldrige Award.

  ...Program May Be Expanded to Include Four Categories

     NIST proponents are pushing to increase the number of categories
in which NIST awards are made annually from two to four.  The new
categories would include health care and education.
     Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.) has included such a provision in
legislation approved by the House Science Committee.  NIST has
received applications from 65 health care and educational
organizations supporting such a move.
     Curt Reimann, director of the Baldrige Award program at NIST,
said the new programs could help the organizations improve
performance, facilitate communication and foster partnerships.

NIST SEES ITSELF PLAYING KEY ROLE IN INFOBAHN    

    NIST officials see the agency as playing a two-part role in the
development of the National Information Infrastructure (NII).  In one
role, it is a "facilitator, keeper and conformance tester" for the
NII, according to information NIST has released. 
     This is buoyed by "funding high-risk industrial ventures,
performing laboratory research, helping smaller manufacturers apply
new technologies, and participating in policy and standards formation
to be sure the technologies are available for real-life applications
of the NII."
     In addition, NIST Director Arati Prabhakar participates in the
Department of Commerce's Information Infrastructure Task Force as
chairwoman of the Committee on Applications and Technology.  The
second part is more of an individual activity as opposed to a NIST
activity per se, the spokesman said.   
     At a recent meeting, directed by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, a
live video hook-up connected people in the auditorium with a submarine
off the coast of California, students in the Midwest and a classroom
in North Carolina.

CONGRESS TO REVIEW BELL ATLANTIC-TCI DEAL,
ADMINISTRATION POSITION UNCLEAR

The antitrust implications of Bell Atlantic Corp.'s proposed
acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. and Liberty Media
Corp. will be scrutinized by House and Senate Committees in
the near future. What remains unclear is what posture the
Clinton administration's Justice Department, the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) or the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) will take with regard to the vertical integration of
network and programming interests represented by the merger
of the telephone and cable giants.

The merger, which ranks among the largest in U.S. history,
presents a potential dilemma for the administration, which has
made a point of emphasizing the private sector's leading role in
the development and financing of a national information
infrastructure.  The reliance on the private sector to hasten
bringing the benefits of an interactive infrastructure to the
nation may run smack into the long-standing Democratic
dedication to tough enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws.

Vice President Al Gore, the administration's point man on the
"information superhighway", issued a cautious statement.  "The
Administration believes that rapid deployment of the
information infrastructure will create jobs, increase our standard
of living, and provide a wide range of services in areas such as
education, health care, and entertainment," he said.

The merger "demonstrates the intense private-sector interest in
the information infrastructure.  The Administration supports any
development in the communications marketplace that is pro-
competitive and fosters the development of an open, interactive
information infrastructure.  Subsequent formal reviews will
determine whether this proposal meets those goals," Gore said.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) said the proposed merger will speed
up the information superhighway, but at the same time, the
chairman of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee said
he was concerned that access to that kind of technology would
only be available to the rich.  The merger proposal leaves many
questions unanswered and "raises all kinds of bells and whistles,"
Markey told ITP in an interview.  "Will it (access to the
information superhighway) happen for everyone, or only the
well-to-do?" he asked.  Markey added that he did not want the
nation to become divided into "the information rich and the
information poor."

It is the government's role to set the policy for the national
communications infrastructure with the private sector taking the
lead in building that system, he said.  "But in setting that policy
we must make certain that everyone participates in the future,"
Markey added.  The real challenge will be to see "who gets what
and when," he said. Those questions were not answered in the
Oct. 13 press conference announcing the proposed merger,
Markey said.

Markey said his panel will hold a series of hearings to examine
the many issues surrounding the merger, including the antitrust
implications.  At the same time, he asked the FCC to start a
formal inquiry to "assess the potential technological and market
bottlenecks created by mergers, acquisitions, and alliances
among cable, telephone, and computer companies."

In an Oct. 13 letter to acting FCC Chairman James Quello,
Markey said the Bell Atlantic-TCI announcement is "just the
latest tremor signalling the shifting nature of the
communications marketplace."  Specifically, Markey said the
FCC inquiry should address:

whether any recently proposed industry mergers, acquisitions, or
alliances creates an organization or alliance that controls
sufficient market dominance to "choke competition and stunt
innovation" in any area of the new video marketplace.

how the merging of regional Bell Operating Companies and
cable companies affects the competition in the current video
market and in the future broad communications market.

whether there should be continued restrictions on telephone
companies owning or operating cable systems within their service
territory.

whether the government should take additional steps to ensure
open systems in the communications marketplace, paying
particular attention to potential bottlenecks in video software
and set-top boxes and in encryption and compression
technologies for satellite distribution of video programming, and,

whether the recently adopted vertical and horizontal limits on
concentration in the cable industry are adequate to protect
consumers and/or competitors.

Markey told ITP there is "no question" more mergers and
alliances between telecommunications companies would be
announced in the future. This is not necessarily good or bad, he
added, but urged quick completion of the inquiry, which he told
Quello was needed "to ensure that the emerging marketplace
remains open and accessible to all and that some of the deals
now being made or contemplated do not result in either closed
systems or anti-competitive practices."

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX) said
"the question for consumers and competitors is whether such a
combination will open up new markets or technologies or simply
foreclose markets to current and potential entrants." Reserving
judgement on the competitive implication of the merger, Brooks
said that responsibility now rests with Assistant Attorney
General Anne Bingaman and her antitrust division.  Brooks said
he will monitor development "very closely" and consider the
implication of such mergers as he proceeds with his own
telecommunications legislation.

"Perhaps such integration is now a fact of life needed to deliver
the most innovative products to consumers.  But if that also
results in driving out creative small and mid-sized competitors,
we may all be the ultimate losers," Brooks said.

Reaction from Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-OH), chairman
of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, was not so measured.  He
"condemned" the proposed merger and called for hearings and
said he will urge Justice and the FTC to intervene.  "The TCI-
Bell Atlantic merger is a double whammy for consumers--they
could face overcharges for both cable TV and local phone
service," the statement said.  "Instead of lower prices from fierce
head-to-head competition between the phone and cable
companies, consumers are facing a mega-monster."

He warned of grave consequences if the merger is allowed to
continue.  "The more you concentrate programming and
economic power, the more you hurt consumers.  TCI, already a
giant in cable and programming, set its sights on expanding its
empire to the Home Shopping Network and now Paramount," he
said.  "Other industry giants like Viacom are also rejecting
competition in favor of combination.  The phone companies
promised us robust competition, but instead of trying to beat the
cable giants, they want to join them and consumers will be the
losers," Metzenbaum said.

Don Elder, a Federal Trade Commission spokesman, would
neither confirm nor deny the FTC is investigating the merger,
but noted that neither company is on its "early termination" list
of mergers and acquisitions given de facto approval.  The "early
termination" list is a daily report of business agreements the
FTC believes raise no antitrust issues.

By ITP's news deadline, neither Justice nor the FCC had a
reaction to the merger.  But some state regulators did.In Bell
Atlantic's home state of Pennsylvania, Vice Chairman of the
Public Utility Commission Joseph Rhodes Jr. viewed the
proposed merger with skepticism.  "In my opinion, Bell Atlantic
must prove to this commission that they can accomplish this
merger without divesting themselves of Bell of Pennsylvania," he
said.

"We have fought for years to determine if Bell of Pennsylvania
customers are unfairly subsidizing, for example, Bell Atlantic's
efforts at diversification such as its recently announced plans to
invest $1 billion in Mexico," he said.  "Bell Atlantic has fought
this audit at every juncture.  Imagine the difficulty we would
have to audit a merged Bell Atlantic-TCI.  Bell Atlantic
shareholders, not Bell of Pennsylvania ratepayers, should bear
the risk of this merger."

NIST SEEKS INDUSTRY VIEWS ON REVAMPING
ATP PROJECT-SELECTION PROCESS

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will
host a meeting Oct. 19 to solicit industry views on selecting
projects and establishing major program areas under the
Advance Technology Program (ATP). NIST Director Arati
Prabahkar and ATP Director George Uriano will be the
featured speakers at the meeting, which will be held at NIST
headquarters in Gaithersburg, Md.

With increased funding proposed in fiscal 1994 and the years
following, ATP will move from a pilot program to a full-fledged
civilian technology program.  The government is asking all
interested parties for their ideas for new program areas that
should be included in the ATP.  Since 1990, 60 projects have
been funded through ATP.  This does not include the projects
that will be funded this year with remaining monies for fiscal
1993, which ended Sept. 30.  That announcement, which could
include up to 30 projects, is likely before the end of the month,
a NIST official said.  ATP funding for FY-93 was $67.9 million.

At ITP's news deadline, House and Senate negotiators were
close to approving a budget for FY-94 that aides say will
probably reflect the $199.5 million proposed by the Clinton
administration.  The House earlier had cut the president's
request to $129 million (ITP, June 28, p. 1).  The
administration's intention is to ramp up the program by 275
percent until it reaches $750 million by FY-97.

The meeting with industry is the best avenue on getting ideas for
the best return on tax dollars, said a NIST spokesman.  "The
idea is to explain our intention to establish areas for more tightly
focused research and what the criteria shall be for selecting what
those program areas are," the spokesman said.  Program areas
would encompass a group of projects with a common feature
that works toward a specific technology or a business goal, he
explained.  Project proposals would still have to compete under
previously determined criteria published in the Federal Register
as part of the ATP project solicitation.  Ideas for program areas
will be accepted at any time, while proposals for specific projects
under the ATP could only be accepted in response to an ATP
solicitation, which last occurred in February.

Selection criteria for the program areas will also be discussed at
the meeting. In a notice for the meeting, NIST said it intends
the program areas to have "well-defined technology and
economic goals, and generally will require development of an
ensemble of complementary technologies."  The shift to focused
competitions centered around specific programs "will allow the
ATP to achieve greater benefits for the nation by concentrating
support on suites of interrelated technologies and reaping the
benefits of scale and synergism," according to the agency.

To register for the meeting, or to receive documents distributed
at the meeting after Oct. 19, contact the ATP office at 1-800-
micf.nist.gov, or by
facsimile at (301) 926-9524.

HOUSE SCIENCE PANEL READYING NEW MEASURE
TO SPUR DEVELOPMENT OF `GREEN' TECHNOLOGIES

The House Science Committee's proposed legislation on "green"
technology should be finalized and ready for introduction within
the next few weeks, according to committee sources.  And while
a previously circulated one-page outline of the proposal has been
rendered "obsolete," many key initiatives still remain on the
drawing board as the committee aims to craft legislation that
would encourage the development and adoption of green
technologies by the government and private sector.

Environmental, or "green" technologies include both the
traditional technologies for "pollution control and clean-up, as
well as `other' products and processes that provide significant
environmental and economic benefits," said Rep. Tim Valentine
(D-NC) chairman of the subcommittee on technology,
environment and aviation at an Oct. 5 hearing.  "It is this latter
group of technologies that has the potential for widespread
impact across many industries," Valentine said.

But now, with a renewed emphasis on the environment led by
top officials in the Clinton administration including Vice
President Al Gore, both government officials and representatives
of the private sector are calling for incentives for government-
public partnerships, financial incentives to develop new
technologies and relief from too stringent regulatory
requirements.  "Flexible, performance-based regulation that
stimulates innovation for both environmental and economic
benefits will have to be a collaborative exercise," said Pete
Howard, vice president of environmental affairs for Georgia-
Pacific Corp.

DETAILS OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION

At ITP's news deadline, committee members were still reviewing
each section of the proposed legislation, suggesting additions and
fine tuning other areas.  The "framework is still being cleaned
up," said one committee aide involved in drafting the legislation.
Also, the legislative language is being modified for consistency.
For example, this would eliminate any confusion over the terms
"green technology" and "environmental technology," the aide
said.

The proposed legislation is originating in the panel's
subcommittee on technology, environment and aviation.  The
legislation is expected to address:

Greater coordination among government agencies involved in
the development and adoption of green technologies;
establishing an Environment and Technology Clearinghouse; and
enhancing the capability for life cycle assessments of material
flows.

Greater emphasis on green technologies in existing programs;
establishing an Innovative Environmental Technologies Awards
Program; promoting the development of Environmental
Remediation and Monitoring Technology; establishing an
Industrial Integration Demonstration Project; and creating a
President's Total Environmental Quality Award.

Encouraging green technology projects in Small Business
Innovation Research grants; promoting the government as a
market to accelerate the development of green technologies;
evaluating the impact of regulatory practices on the contribution
of innovation to pollution prevention, control and remediation.

Promoting industry education and outreach; integrating
environmental sustainability issues into engineering education;
enhancing public knowledge of sustainable development through
the National Science Foundation.

Improving technical standards of environmental performance
and efficacy; providing guidelines for consumer claims.

Improving international assistance promoting green technologies;
establishing an International Environmental Technology Center;
enhancing export financing (steps the Clinton administration has
already begun); improving benchmarking; and clarifying the
potential for international green markets.

Partnerships between government and the private sector that
include risk sharing should be encouraged, said government and
private sector representatives at another recent congressional
hearing.  Representatives from both sides also called for
financial incentives and regulatory relief.

"We have started a dialogue with American companies who want
to collaborate to share the risks of technology development with
(the Environmental Protection Agency) and other federal
agencies," senior EPA official Walter Kovalick said in testimony
Sept. 30 before a Senate environment subcommittee.

As far as specific provisions in the proposed House legislation,
financial incentives remain under consideration, but committee
sources say the proposal most likely will call for a study to
determine what incentives would be the most viable. There are
so many tax incentives now available to companies that it doesn't
make sense to impose a specific standard, said one source.

HOUSE JUDICIARY PANEL HEARS SOFTWARE
INDUSTRY LEADERS DISCUSS COMPETITION, TRADE
PRACTICES

Against the background of a possible Justice Department
investigation into alleged anticompetitive trade practices by
industry leader Microsoft Corp., executives from some of the
nation's leading computer software firms went before a House
Judiciary subcommittee last week to discuss competition in the
computer industry.  Chief among the concerns of the industry
officials was competition from overseas computer firms, software
piracy and trade restrictions that hamper the ability of U.S. firms
to effectively compete with their foreign counterparts.

Outdated, "unrealistic, unilateral controls that effectively prohibit
exports of software with encryption capabilities" imposed by the
United States must be lifted, said William Neukom, vice
president of law and corporate affairs for Microsoft.  Neukom
argued that these trade barriers threaten the industry's future
international sales.  The Clinton administration has proposed
liberalizing export restrictions on computers but not encryption
software.  That position has been criticized by the Software
Publishers' Association (ITP, Sept. 6, p. 12).  He also said that
software piracy, which is rampant in many areas, costs U.S.
companies approximately $10 billion annually in foreign
revenues.

Innovation must continue to be encouraged, Neukom said.  "The
benefits of continuous software innovation permeate the
economy" as software innovation improves the competitiveness
of other U.S. industries that utilize software products, he said.
Neukom also noted that the competitiveness of the computer
industry means that "not all companies that exist today will be as
successful or even in existence five years from now."
Competition will increase overall, he said, as firms vie "to
develop more advanced operating systems that take advantage of
the explosive technological growth in hardware."

David Bradford, general counsel of Novell, Inc. told the
lawmakers that congressional efforts to clarify the treatment of
joint ventures under the antitrust laws and to eliminate any
unnecessary obstacles to their formation was a boost to the
industry's ability to compete internationally.

But one area that still needs improvement is the patent system,
according to Jerry Rogers, president and chief executive officer
of Cyrix Corp.  "America must address its antiquated patent
system so that it may encourage innovation rather than hinder
it," Rogers said.  The Cyrix official claims that "under the
present system patents are issued that reflect marginal advances
in technology or a similar implementation of existing
manufacturing process or product" which in turn advances large
corporations while intimidating smaller companies.

In general, the witnesses side-stepped discussing the alleged
trade practice violations by Microsoft. However, Paul Johnson, a
vice president of First Boston, testified that the government must
"make sure that the current dominant market leaders do not
abuse their natural economies of scale."

Johnson said, "In other words, Microsoft clearly dominates the
market for PC operating systems and applications.  No one can
deny it, and I doubt anything could be done to change it.
However, Microsoft should not be allowed to abuse this market
position in terms of pricing leverage or `anti-competitive'
activities," he said.  Justice is reviewing files compiled by the
Federal Trade Commission to determine if Microsoft has
engaged in anticompetitive practices (ITP, Aug. 9, p. 12).

While noting that the computer industry is "fast-moving and
complex," Subcommittee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Texas) said
that does not mean "it is immune from antitrust and other
competition-related problems."

At the same time, Brooks pointed out that such characteristics
do not mean "that the market would necessarily be served by the
replacement of one dominant industry monolith with a number
of smaller companies able to unfairly exert control over
particular key segments of the computer industry."  Brooks also
stressed that as long as federal agencies are investigating charges
of unfair competitive practices within the industry, his committee
did not intend "to invade upon that process."

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES PILOT PROGRAM
FOR NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE

The House Telecommunications Subcommittee approved
legislation Oct. 14 to fund pilot projects that promote the
development of a national information superhighway.  The
Telecommunications Infrastructure and Facilities Assistance Act
of 1993, H.R. 2639, authorizes grant money for communities or
organizations that develop innovative uses for nationwide
computer networks.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee and
key sponsor of the proposal, said the measure "reflects the
commitment of the government to make certain that health care
institutions, schools, libraries and local governments share in the
communications future."

To fund the pilot projects, the bill will have the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
establish and maintain a Telecommunications and Information
Infrastructure Development Program that will promote the
widespread availability of advanced telecommunications to health
care providers, educational institutions and state and local
governments.

Markey said the program "is designed to support the formation
of a nationwide, high-speed, interactive infrastructure made up
of a variety of technologies through the interconnection and
improvement of existing facilities and the deployment of new
facilities."  The bill authorizes an additional $151 million in
Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996 for NTIA to award grants for 50
percent of construction costs.

SPACE STATION BECOMES FOREIGN POLICY VEHICLE;
JOINT VENTURE WITH RUSSIA PROPOSED

Dr. John H. Gibbons, director of the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), announced Oct. 6 that
the United States will incorporate the Russian Mir space station
into the newly redesigned and recently renamed space station
Alpha project, formerly called space station Freedom.

The new space station option grew out of a meeting held Sept. 1
and 2 between Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime
Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.  Under the terms of the
agreement reached between Gore and Chernomyrdin, the
United States will pay $400 million over four years for the use of
Mir and the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.  In return,
the U.S. will receive assurances from Russia that it will abide by
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the agreement to
limit the spread of rockets and related technologies.  China and
Brazil have been accused of breaking the MTCR, and many fear
that cash-strapped Russia might find it unable to resist selling
banned technology.

Marcia S. Smith, a specialist in science and technology policy for
the Congressional Research Service, emphasized that the Mir
option is only one of three choices emerging from the confusion
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA)
efforts to redesign and trim costs for the space station.  The
three designs are the "American option"; using a Lockheed Corp.
"bus" for guidance navigation and control; the
"American/Russian" option, using a Salyut tug for the same
functions; and the "Russian/American" option developed during
the Gore/Chernomyrdin discussions.

The latest announcement comes on the heels of a rocky year for
the project, which is criticized for being over budget and a waste
of precious federal science funds at a time of record budget
shortfalls.  In a packed hearing room before the subcommittee
on space of the House Committee of Science, Space and
Technology, Gibbons defended the option to employ Mir as a
means of cutting both deployment time and expenses.  Members
of the panel voiced skepticism about the uncertainty raised by
issues such as the attempted coup quashed by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, sovereignity and control, and technical difficulties
in linking the two programs.

The new modular design, a composite of two out of three plans
submitted by NASA in June after the Clinton administration
demanded a less expensive station, would include Mir as a
component of a larger station.  Gibbons stated that Mir would
provide the U.S. with a quick boost in knowledge while
providing Russians with needed capital to help that country's
economic development.  "We now have the historic opportunity
to combine our efforts in space across a spectrum of programs,"
Gibbons testified.  "Not in the context of an adversarial
relationship, but rather, one that is based on cooperation and
partnership.  We believe that the steps taken during the
Gore/Chernomyrdin meeting will set us on a course that will
allow us to work together on space activities to minimize costs,
maximize research potential and reduce the time needed to do
projects."

COLLABORATION WOULD OCCUR IN THREE PHASES


The Russian/American collaboration would occur in three-
phases.  The first phase would give the U.S. the right to fly long-
term missions on Mir to develop skills needed for future space
station operations.  Phase two would begin shuttle service to a
Mir module as an "interim human-tended science facility."  The
third phase would be full-scale integration of the Russian space
program into the international space-station consortium currently
led by the U.S.  Other members of the consortium include
Canada, European countries and Japan.  Gibbons said details
will be made available Nov. 1.

Gibbons fended off a series of questions, on the one hand
assuring Rep. Jim Bacchus (D-FL) that the space station
program would continue to be based at Cape Canaveral (in
Bacchus' district), while assuring others on the committee that
neither extra money would be appropriated for the proposed
joint venture nor any American jobs put at risk.

"No one should confuse the course we are charting as
relinquishing control of the Space Station or exporting jobs out
of the U.S.," Gibbons said.  "In developing this cooperative
program, we are focusing on areas that will not negatively impact
the U.S. aerospace sector.  In some areas, such as dynamic solar
power and closed life support systems, we believe that the net
gain of new technologies from the Russians could stimulate jobs
in the U.S."

The most contentious issues, however, were the most technical.
Integration of the two space station projects reveals fundamental
technical differences between the programs that may make
joining them difficult.  The Russian/American space station
program would use a 51.6 degrees orbit, as opposed to the space
shuttle, which has always used a 28 degrees orbit.  Adopting to
the new orbit would reduce the launch window from Florida to
six minutes every day while simultaneously increasing the need
for thrust or reducing the size of payloads.

Responding to a question from Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner
(R-WI), Gibbons said the orbital degrees can range from 42 to
52 degrees, but that Russia could not lower itself to our orbit
without risking dropping its spent rockets on China.

Increasing the thrust of the space shuttle probably would require
the continuation of another controversial NASA project, the
advanced solid rocket motor (ASRM).  Ironically, on the
morning of the hearing, the House voted not to consider a rule
change that would have allowed appropriations for ASRM to
continue despite being voted down.  Other options, according to
Gibbons, are to let the Europeans or Russians "do the heavy
lifting."

All of this could become moot, according to Gibbons.  "What we
have is a space station called Alpha that is destined to go
forward with or without Russia," he said.  The proposed $400
million investment will buy "access to the great reservoir of
experience from the Mir," he said.

At a subsequent hearing Oct. 14, NASA Administrator Daniel
Goldin dismissed concerns by some panel members that Russian
technology might be uniformly inferior.  Goldin noted that in
recent years, Russia has made more launches and had fewer
failures than the U.S. space program.  Collaborating with the
Russians will allow the launch of the laboratory module by July
1997, with completion of a new space station by April 2001 at a
savings of $3.5 billion over what it wold cost the U.S. to
complete the project without Russian assistance.  If collaboration
does not occur, Goldin said the laboratory module launch would
be delayed until April 1998 and the space station until Sept.
2003.

OMB OFFICIAL CALLS FOR NEW GOVERNMENT
EFFORT TO USE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

The state of information technology within the government when
the Clinton administration took office was "appalling," according
to Sally Katzen, administrator of the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget.
Testifying Oct. 7 before the House Space, Science and
Technology Committee, Katzen said an essential component of
the National Performance Review (NPR) will require
overhauling the way the government uses, manages and
disseminates its vast store of information.  Noting that the
government has spent staggering sums yearly on information
systems without providing decent service or significantly
improving information infrastructure, Katzen said the two
programs must be integrated to ensure that the goals of either
program are achievable.

According to the NPR report "From Red Tape to Results"
released Sept. 7, more efficient use of information technology is
one of the administration's highest priorities both for improving
government services and reducing costs. The review projects a
savings of up to $5.4 billion over five years by bringing the way
government distributes data into the information age, while at
the same time improving citizen- access to information.  Efforts
to improve information technologies in the past have been
hampered by bad management and programs lacking central
goals or leadership, according to Katzen.

"The federal government's track record in integrating
[information technology] into systems supporting its operations
has produced some successes--and some costly failures," Katzen
testified.  "Despite spending $25 billion in fiscal year 1993 on
information technology, the federal government lacked the
strong and effective leadership required to assure that it makes
the most of these resources."  Without leadership, Katzen
continued, systems developed to deal with small and specific
problems actually aggravate dissemination problems because
separate departments create information fiefdoms--databases
that duplicate those of other agencies and departments.  This,
Katzen said, exacerbates the perception of government as a poor
service-provider and drives up government costs in general.

"In the past, the oversight community--OMB, the General
Services Administration, Congressional committees and the
Inspectors General--has often aggravated the situation by
overemphasizing specific costs such as the acquisition cost of
individual information technology projects, rather than assessing
their effect on program delivery," she said.

THREE STEPS TO INTEGRATION

Katzen proposed a three-step process to integrate the goals of
the National Information Infrastructure (NII) and the National
Performance Review.  Beginning immediately, her office will
evaluate and publicize successful government information
technology ventures across departments and agencies.  This will
aid other departments in determining what programs are
available and effective.

The second phase, which will cover the next 12 to 18 months, is
to "achieve measurable performance gains through fundamental
changes in information management practices."  Katzen
described a possible program, allowing the Department of
Veteran Affairs access to Department of Defense personnel data
on the assumption that there is significant overlap between the
departments.  This would not only save the departments the cost
of having to input the same information twice, but would save
military personnel the aggravation of having to supply it several
times.

The third step would be "to tie the short- and long-term efforts
together" by determining what laws and regulations should be
established, changed or abolished to make the best use of
information gained during the first two steps.

More efficient use of information will also make it easier for the
government to encourage the development of a national
information infrastructure.  The federal government, being the
largest information provider in the country, will provide
significant traffic on any "information highway" that develops.
Moving public information to the network, as outlined in the
reinventing government report, will provide a flood of traffic on
the network.  This will encourage public use and, in turn, will
build the network.

Katzen testified that among the services likely to be more
efficient using NII would be an "integrated electronic benefit
transfer" (EBT) system.  This system would move entitlement
payments from the check- and paper-based systems used today
to an automated teller machine, bank-wire network and plastic
access system.  "In the Food Stamp program alone, there are
over 26 million monthly recipients and the government spends
$400 million annually just to print, distribute and ultimately
destroy stamps," Katzen said.  "EBT adopts commercial
electronic payment practices for the delivery of government
assistance services, enabling benefits to be transferred
automatically."

Other links between the NII and NPR would include heightening
public access to government services through the creation of
information kiosks for retirees so they can access social security
or other information; a national network to link federal state
and local law enforcement and public safety agencies to increase
coordination and reaction times; a national environmental
database that would combine the information gathered by the
Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection
Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the
Department of Commerce and others; and a government-wide e-
mail system.

Katzen said that, as part of NPR, agencies should be encouraged
to work more closely with the information industry and be
provided with incentives to innovate.  Among her suggestion
were:

permit agencies to retain a portion of any savings that their
innovations create, instead of the current system in which
agencies that do not expend their full appropriations find their
budgets reduced the following fiscal year;

promote performance-based contracting, instead of narrowly
defined, low-risk procurement, allowing agencies to leverage the
expertise of the contractor with award fees, performance
incentives and value engineering;

use multi-year funding, which would free information managers
from year-to-year appropriations battles; and

establish a government-wide venture capital fund to promote
partnership between government and industry to develop new
technologies.

Finally, Katzen said the most important aspect of making the
NII and NPR work together would be rigorous and constant
retraining of government workers to keep abreast of new
technologies.  "Many members of the federal workforce lack
sufficient training and background to use new technologies
effectively, and many managers fail to realize the importance
of...training,"  she said.  "Even though the government spends
billions of dollars each year on information technology, contracts
and acquisitions do not include training provisions in the initial
design stages."

U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE
IS AT THE CENTER OF ECONOMY

Under Bruce A. Lehman, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
will be on a "quest for quality and customer service" during the
next several years.  Lehman was sworn in as assistant secretary
of commerce and commissioner of the Patent Office on Sept. 15.
He intends to continue a multi-year automation plan for systems
serving the agency's main activities--patent and trademark
processing, information dissemination and administration.  The
slow pace of patent processing in the past has prompted
congressional criticism, but Lehman believes that "automation
may open the way for truly international patent searching--
maybe even to a world patent."

Many still regard patents and other intellectual property rights as
esoteric subjects.  But this view is not held by corporations,
universities, government research centers and others who
increasingly seek patents here and overseas for their new
products or processes.  Governments have also realized the
importance patents play in the technology competitiveness race,
and many have begun to modernize their national patent offices
to meet demand and to benefit from new information-handling
and storage technologies.  In addition, patent office directors are
being urged to charge "user fees" that reflect the real costs of
providing services to inventors and patent attorneys.
Automation may offer an economic solution that serves well
both government agencies and patent applicants.

In existence since 1790, the Patent and Trademark Office
expects to deal with about 188,000 patents and 142,000
trademark applications this year, and estimates that it will collect
fees of about $486 million.  From its offices in Arlington, Va., a
staff of 4,893 receive, examine and process America's
technological hopes for the future.  As a link to the health of
technology-based industries, Lehman said his office "stands at
the very [center] of a technology-based economy."  It is
surprising that the Patent Office does not come under the aegis
of the Commerce Department's newly empowered Technology
Administration, as do the National Institute of Standards and
Technology and the National Technical Information Service.

Nevertheless, Lehman sees new opportunities for his agency.
For example, through the recently announced Information
Infrastructure Task Force, he will lead an Intellectual Property
Working Group looking into policies that will encourage use of
the new infrastructure.  His group will investigate ways of
ensuring "copyright integrity" for creators of information and
entertainment products, as well as investigate the relationship of
"standards" and "open systems" to copyright law and "fair use"
principles in the context of electronic superhighways.

As part of the new U.S.-Japan trade-framework agreement, the
Patent Office will be leading the U.S. government side on all
intellectual property issues in these negotiations.  "Few
assignments given to the Commissioner of the Patent Office
have been more important that this one," Lehman said.

NO LONGER A DICKENSIAN BACKWATER

Once a Dickensian backwater of information-handling with dusty
shelves of dog-eared papers, shoe-box filing systems, primitive
copying machines and constant vulnerability to fire and rodent
damage, today's Patent Office is being equipped with automation
systems so its operations can run with fewer staff yet achieve
faster response times.  These computerized systems include
workstations with state-of-the-art graphic interfaces for
examiners and networks of databases with foreign patent
organizations.  Increasingly, CD-ROM formats are used for
storing and searching current and past patent records.

Lehman recognizes that automation alone doesn't immediately
improve the quality or efficiency of its services.  "I believe that
[quality] is closely linked in any organization with morale," he
said.  To increase morale, Lehman will review the Patent
Office's structure and in particular the patent examining corps
and its support functions.  Lehman hopes to identify changes
which will give improved support for examiners and create a
better sense of teamwork and customer service in all employees.
Furthermore, examiners may be offered new career development
opportunities--such as being detailed to other federal agencies--
to broaden their experience and perspective.

Concern has been voiced by Patent Office insiders and
intellectual property lawyers about efforts to reduce patent
pendency (the time it takes for a patent to be issued or an
application to be rejected), and whether this is being achieved
partly at the expense of the quality of examination.  Lehman
said the basis for this concern is that the patent examining corps'
performance criteria emphasize production rather than "quality"
in the examination process.  Ongoing quality audits by the
agency's in-house patent quality review unit suggests that quality
is improving; however, Lehman said the criteria used to judge
examiners needs a closer look to see if changes could provide
incentives for quality equal to those encouraging production.

In a new mission statement for the Patent Office, Commerce
Secretary Ronald H. Brown recently defined its role as:

Administering the laws relating to patents and trademarks so as
to promote U.S. industrial and technological progress and
strengthen the national economy;

Developing and advising the secretary and the administration on
intellectual property policy, including copyright matters; and

 Advising the secretary and other U.S. government agencies,
such as the U.S. trade representative, on trade-related aspects of
intellectual property in cooperation with the International Trade
Administration.

One of Lehman's urgent tasks will be to consider the possible
adoption of the first-to-file patent system as a prelude to the
Patent Harmonization Treaty.  Presently the United States uses
a first-to-invent approach but is the only developed country using
it.  First-to-file and other changes recommended by an Advisory
Commission on Patent Law Reform in September 1992, would
permit integration of the United States into an international
patent system.  A consensus initially appeared to support
adopting them but has since deteriorated and Lehman will hold
public hearings and solicit new comments on the matter.  A
recent General Accounting Office report found that 66 percent
of the companies it surveyed were in favor of the change.

Despite his background in intellectual property, Lehman seems
unlikely to be a prisoner of the system.  Addressing American
Bar Association members in New York recently, he said "It's my
desire to develop a better mechanism for making and exercising
the office's obligation to make policy in a variety of areas
involving patent, trademark and copyright systems.  All too often
[the Patent Office] had been a passive bystander as technology,
the courts or Congress have forced it into reacting to a limited
number of policy choices.  Many historic decisions as to
patentability of a new art have been made in a `Star Chamber'
proceeding in the commissioner's office with only a few insiders
present and nothing more to go on than the information
supplied by one patent applicant.  I intend to reverse this
process."  Lehman is drawing up a list of areas of "turmoil" and
will hold public hearings on the policy options involved.  Topics
likely to be examined are computer-related inventions,
particularly software, and biotechnology inventions.  Perhaps in a
few more years, Lehman speculated, the ability to examine
patents using a desk-top personal computer may lead us to
question whether we even need a centralized patent office any
longer.

DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY ENLISTED
IN WAR AGAINST BREAST CANCER

The Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory and Fischer Imaging Corp. of Denver signed a
cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) last
week to create a new mammography system that will allow
earlier detection of breast cancer.

The three-year, $3.28 million agreement will utilize an imaging
technology previously developed for weapons applications.
Fischer is funding 73 percent of the project.  While both DOE
and Fischer will contribute "nearly equally" in the initial r&d
phase, according to DOE, Fischer will support the clinical trials
and the approval process before the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

After devoting three years to solving technical problems, it is
expected to take another two years to prove the system works in
clinical tests and to obtain FDA approval.  The research phase is
estimated to cost less that $2 million, with the clinical trials and
approval process costing another $1.5 million.

Specifically, the CRADA is aimed at "developing a new imaging
system that will produce clearer images using less radiation, thus
enabling earlier and more accurate detection of breast cancer
and the saving of lives," according to DOE.  The CRADA
partners will develop a device that eliminates the use of X-ray
film, and instead uses sophisticated detectors to directly record
the X-ray image in digital form.  The detector array employs
charge coupled devices (CCDs) to record 20 million individual
pixels, each 30 times smaller than the period at the end of a
sentence.  Since the image is digital, a computer can be used to
enhance the image.

At the signing ceremony held in Washington on Oct. 6, Energy
Secretary Hazel O'Leary said "Health care is technology
intensive and the battle for better, safer and cheaper health care
demands that we use every weapon at our disposal.  The
national laboratories are a vital element in our technology
arsenal, and this agreement shows that we are using the
laboratories to help wage the battle for improved health care."
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said the agreement "is a
breakthrough in the area of defense conversion and a
breakthrough in the fight against an epidemic."

Also, the technology commercialized under this agreement is
expected to hasten the widespread use of "telemedicine" insofar
as it will allow transmission of images over information
highways, facilitating communication between radiologists.  Dr.
Faina Shtern, head of the Diagnostic Imaging Research Branch
of the National Cancer Institute, praised the project and said,
"While digital mammography is still under development, its
potential to improve breast cancer management warrants further
research."

CANADIAN BELL SCIENTIST CLAIMS TO CRACK
DES ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM; NIST CONSIDERING
REVIEW

A Canadian computer scientist claims to have designed a
machine to crack the federal government's Data Encryption
Standard (DES), merely by searching random numbers at high-
speeds for a few hours.  Michael J. Wiener, a scientist with Bell-
Northern Research in Ottawa, presented the paper at a
conference in August.  A spokeswoman for the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, whose scientists originally
designed the DES algorithm in 1981, said they first saw the
document Oct. 13 and have not yet evaluated Weiner's blueprint.
DES is used widely in computer communications.

The heart of the machine is a special chip that Weiner said can
test the keys "at the impressive rate of 50 million per second," by
eliminating the need to feed data in and out of the chip while it
is running. Wiener undertook designing the chip and explaining
how it works in a 47-page document "for the purpose of
assessing the resistance of DES to an exhaustive attack," he said.
By using this attack, "DES keys can be found one to two orders
of magnitude faster than other recently proposed designs."
Wiener said his design shows how to build a machine for $1
million that will break DES in about 3.5 hours.

"The chip can be comfortably clocked at 50 MHz," slower than
the chips which run a 486 computer, "and would cost $10.50 to
manufacture," Wiener said.  In the machine, ten key search chips
are controlled by a "microcontroller" which searches for codes.
The machine uses 12 groups of 10 chips, controlled by a master
microcontroller to form a "shelf."  "Four shelves are contained to
form a frame which is controlled by a PC.  A frame costs
$100,000 and contains 5760 key search chips," the document said.

DES CRACKED `ALARMINGLY QUICKLY'

"USING the design described here, DES keys can be found
alarmingly quickly," Weiner wrote.  Given that a key search chip
tests 50 million keys per second and a frame costs $100,000 and
contains 5760 chips, he computed the following approximate
search-time-to-cost ratios:  A $100,000 machine would take 35
hours to crack the code; a $1 million machine would take 3.5
hours; and a $10 million machine would take only 21 minutes.
He said a machine could be built in ten months by three people.
With labor, support and manufacturing, Weiner estimated a
simple machine would cost a total of $500,000 to build.

DES may be replaced by the new Clipper Chip data encryption
algorithm called "skipjack," an allegedly impenetrable encryption
algorithm introduced by the Clinton administration in April.  In
an independent review of the Clipper Chip, Georgetown
University Computer Science Professor Dorothy Denning said it
would be 36 years before the cost of breaking skipjack by
exhaustive search will be equal to the cost of breaking the Data
Encryption Standard today.  "Thus, there is no significant risk
that Skipjack will be broken by exhaustive search in the next 30
to 40 years," Denning said (ITP, Aug. 9, p. 13).

Wiener told ITP that his research was intended as an exercise to
help DES users asses the strength of the encryption.  He
emphasized that he has not built a machine, but only provided
the blueprints for a chip, and that NIST has not commented on
his work.  He added that cracking DES did not imply that the
same key search techniques could be used to crack the Clipper
Chip "skipjack" algorithm.  "Certainly all encryption systems are
more or less vulnerable.  It depends on the size of the keys."
Noting that skipjack used very large keys, he said it would not be
practical to attack with random key searches.

David Banisar, a policy analyst for Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, a public interest organization that monitors
encryption policy, said the code-breaking chip is significant
because it creates in practice what has previously been proposed
only in theory.  "He's actually gone through with a computer-
aided design program and designed the chip, which nobody had
done before," Banisar said.  Weiner noted that DES could still
remain foolproof if its algorithm was tripled in each use.  If used
in this way, the encryption code in effect becomes numerically
"larger than the national debt spread around the earth and moon
in orbit," Banisar added.

MEMBER STATES' WORRIES SLOW
EC PROGRESS ON R&D FRAMEWORK PLAN

BRUSSELS--Work is proceeding slowly on the European
Commission's proposal for a new EC framework program for
r&d.  EC research ministers discussed this proposal, which is the
fourth in a series of four-year programs, for EC funding last
June and they were scheduled to do so again Oct. 11.

All 12 member states have expressed serious reservations about
the commission's proposal.  The difficulties mainly concern the
proposed budget of 13 billion ECUs (1 ECU = $1.17) from 1994
to 1998.  But selection criteria for r&d program support also are
controversial.  The budget figures put forward by EC member
states vary from 6.5 billion to 14 billion ECUs.  Generally, it is
expected that member states will try to narrow this range to
some figure below 13 billion ECUs.  That sentiment concerns
the commission, whose staff believes a budget of 13 billion
ECUs is the minimum necessary for the EC to support r&d.

Most member states still disagree with the commission's
distribution of funds within research categories, but it seems
clear that they agree on reducing funding for communications
and information technology.  The commission and member
states want to give their final approval to this framework
program in December.  This goal is ambitious.  The problems
cited above are substantial.

INTELSAT GROUP TO STUDY PRIVATIZATION
IN RESPONSE TO REQUEST BY U.S. OFFICIALS

A special Intelsat working party has agreed to a U.S. proposal to
include the privatization of the global satellite consortium on the
group's agenda of strategic issues for further study.

Representatives of the U.S. government and the U.S. signatory,
Comsat Corp., proposed that the working party include on its
agenda a study of the implications of converting Intelsat from
"an international, intergovernmental organization into a private
multinational corporation," an informed source told ITP.  The
working party met in Washington last month following the
conclusion of the Intelsat Board of Governors meeting Sept. 9 to
15.  The meeting was convened to establish an agenda of key
issues for Intelsat's future that need near-term study.

An Intelsat spokesman confirmed that "the issue of privatization
is on the agenda" of the working group but noted that the group
was charged by Intelsat's Assembly of Parties last November
with studying a host of strategic issues.  "It would almost be
remiss if they didn't consider privatization," he said, "but it is not
a foregone conclusion.  We're not looking at it to happen
tomorrow or two years from now, but there's obviously a
possibility it could happen over the long term."

The working group originally had been formed to consider
responses to calls by the United States and some other member
nations for a loosening of requirements under Article XIV(d) of
the Intelsat Agreement for consultations with Intelsat before
member nations permit the use of separate satellite systems for
international services.

The U.S. proposal to look at a privatization of Intelsat reflected
a view by U.S. government policy-makers that Intelsat needs the
greatest possible flexibility to meet growing international satellite
service competition, sources said.  "Increasingly, it's a strain for
the U.S. government to try and mediate battles between Intelsat
and its competitors, when we believe Intelsat needs greater
flexibility, and its competitors say it shouldn't have that flexibility
while it retains the treaty privileges and immunities," one U.S.
government source said.  "So, it seems to make sense to consider
this--the option of privatization and the pros and cons."

In their presentations to the Intelsat working party, U.S.
government and Comsat representatives reportedly made it clear
that the United States is committed to Intelsat remaining
economically competitive and that it recognizes "the universal
service principles inherent in the Intelsat agreements" and the
fact that Intelsat remains the only provider of satellite services
with global reach.

TOUGH CHOICES FACE U.S. MANUFACTURING
JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE TOLD

The U.S. government should adopt an "industrial development
policy" to provide guidance to small and medium-sized
manufacturing companies, said Philip Braverman, senior vice
president and chief economist of DKB Securities Corp, Oct. 5 at
a Joint Economic Committee hearing chaired by Rep. Lee
Hamilton (D-IN).

Braverman said such businesses were "likely to benefit most
from a stream of information and suggestions on where their
investment dollars might be most expeditiously placed and which
are the most likely avenues for productive research."  He also
suggested holding regional, industry-wide meetings attended by
top people in various fields to "plan collectively" for the future.

"Recognized experts in various high-technology disciplines could
be invited to take `dollar-a-year' government positions to foster
progress in their fields," Braverman said.  Pilot projects, modeled
after the recently announced government and industry
partnership to develop an environmentally correct car, should be
encouraged.

Braverman was one of three witnesses before the committee--all
of whom agreed that difficult choices confront U.S.
manufacturing in its efforts to deal with declining jobs,
intensified foreign competition and sluggish adoption of new
technologies.  The hearing examined recent statistics of
manufacturing job losses and the prospects for halting or slowing
this trend through stimulating U.S. manufacturing growth,
possibly using new technologies.

Hamilton expressed concern over the latest unemployment
figures, saying they showed that each month the equivalent of
one-and-a-half Fortune 500 company's employees lost their jobs
in the nation's manufacturing sector and this posed serious
questions about the future of America's manufacturing
capabilities for domestic as well as export markets.

Hamilton's remarks were put into national perspective by Julie
Fox Gorte, senior associate at the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment (OTA).  She said that more than 18
million Americans, or 15 percent of the U.S. workforce, were
employed in manufacturing.

Generally these were "jobs with better pay and superior benefits
than the average for production and nonsupervisory workers,"
Gorte said "[so] people who lose manufacturing jobs typically
find replacements only with either lower pay, fewer benefits or
both.  For that reason alone, dwindling manufacturing
employment is a concern."

Gorte referred to several OTA studies which identified possible
policy options to reduce the impact of foreign competitiveness
on U.S. industry.  But she said "An issue [currently] facing many
smaller manufacturers in particular is lack of access to bank
financing; even though the recession is officially over, many
(especially smaller enterprises) are having a tough time getting
loans.  This situation developed after OTA's work on
competitiveness was delivered, so our reports suggest no options
to remedy it; however, the issue needs addressing."

TECHNOLOGY MOVES TOO FAST FOR SMALL
COMPANIES

Commenting on possible measures to increase technology
diffusion, Gorte said the pace of technological change was "often
faster than enterprise managers can cope with" at small- and
medium-sized companies who also have trouble "learning about
and understanding new production machinery and techniques, or
soft production technologies such as continuous improvement
and statistical process controls."

She observed that Japan and Germany both have "well-
developed networks to inform small manufacturers of what
technological improvements (both hard and soft) they could
make," and noted that extensive public subsidies for loans to
enable small enterprises to adopt new technologies existed in
Japan, Korea and several other nations.

In the United States, Gorte characterized such systems of
technological extension and information service as "much more
rudimentary, particularly at the federal level."  Although a few
states have well-developed manufacturing extension services,
they are "typically much smaller than the potential demand for
their services," Gorte noted.  Learning from and expanding on
the most promising of the new technology extension efforts,
including parts of the recently authorized Technology
Reinvestment Program, over the next several years was
recommended.

Gorte singled out as an example of a small yet meritorious
public cost-sharing program in civilian technology development,
the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  "In the few years
of its operation [ATP] has gained a reputation for sensible
management and promising investment," Gorte said.  "Early
evaluations show that it continues to look promising."

BRIEFS

The Commerce Department this week will announce the winner
or winners of the 1993 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality
Award.  This year, 76 companies applied for the award, which
recognizes overall quality strategy and management.  That field
was narrowed to 13 in August and teams from the award's board
of examiners visited the companies in September.  The finalists
included  four manufacturers, five service companies and four
small businesses.  The Baldrige award has been given since 1988.
Last year's winners included AT&T Network Systems
Group/Transmission Systems Business Unit, Texas Instruments
Inc. Defense Systems & Electronics Group, AT&T Universal
Card Services, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel co. and Granite Rock Co.

The Department of Energy's Office of Defense Programs has
approved its first technology transfer projects for Fiscal Year
1994.  The awards, totalling $8.4 million, will be funded through
DOE's national laboratories.  The projects approved range in
scope from electron beam processing of manufacturing waste to
intelligent control systems for combustion engines, according to
a DOE official.  The Y-12 facility operated by Martin Marietta
received $900,000 for one project; Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory received $900,000 for three projects; Los Alamos
National Laboratory received $1.4 million for three projects and
Sandia National Laboratory received $5.2 million to fund nine
projects.

The Clinton administration has agreed to establish a defense
conversion clearinghouse in the Commerce Department.  The
proposal was introduced by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) as an
amendment to the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Department
Authorization bill (ITP, Sept. 20, p.18).  The Office of Economic
Conversion Information would provide information on federal,
state and local defense conversion programs for companies,
workers and localities hurt by military downsizing and base
closures.

The Superconducting Super Collider's (SSC) fate may be
determined when the House considers this week the $22 billion
Fiscal Year 1994 spending bill for energy and water projects.
House opponents were furious last week when House and
Senate conferees agreed to include $640 million in funds for the
SSC in the bill despite the House having voted to kill the project
by a vote of 280-150 in June.  The Senate had voted 57-42 to
continue the project.  So far, the federal government has spent
$1.6 billion in the SSC, which will cost an estimated $11 billion
to complete.  Opponents have charged that in tight fiscal times,
the money could be either saved or better spent on more
practical technology endeavors.

Faulty kidney transplant data render patients 'dead'+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Health and Welfare Ministry is investigating irregularities
in data in a national computerized network on kidney transplant
patients which has led to some being wrongly classified as deceased,
ministry officials said Monday.
     The officials said the ministry has ordered an overhaul of the
data bank which was set up in April this year.
     The network collects information on a national scale about
patients and matches them with an organ when one becomes available
to ensure a fair and equitable system for the transplants.
     The irregularities apparently originated when inaccurate data
under the old system, collected mainly by a national hospital in
Sakura in Chiba Prefecture, were fed into the new network, the
officials said.
     One male patient in Niigata Prefecture on the central Sea of
Japan coast was denied a request for a transplant after he was
classified as dead.  He is still undergoing artificial dialysis.
     Another patient in the same prefecture, who had received a
transplant, was also classified as dead.
     Faulty computer software also caused one patient in the Kinki
region around Osaka and Kobe to be removed from the priority list for
transplant.
     The error was discovered when the patient's doctor made
inquiries about the change, and the patient's chances for a
transplant were not affected.
     Some 20,000 people are listed on the system and till late
November, 112 transplant operations had been carried out under it.

Child born after sperm cultivated from sterile father+

NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Japanese woman succeeded in delivering a child this month
using a method in which sperm cultivated directly from testicular
tissue of the sterile father was injected into her egg cells,
doctors at Nagoya University's medical department said Monday.
     The medical department's group, headed by Nobuhiko Suganuma, an
assistant professor of obstetrics, said it was the second successful
birth using the method in Japan following another such case in the
southern Japanese region of Kyushu.
     Suganuma's team cultivated a tiny bit of tissue taken from the
man's testicles until they yielded four mature sperm cells, which
they injected into four of the wife's ova in a microscopic
fertilization technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection
(ICSI).
     One fertilized egg cell was returned to the woman's womb, and
she was confirmed pregnant two weeks later, the doctors said.
     The woman, who is in her 20s and living in Aichi Prefecture,
central Japan, gave birth to a little girl 49.5 centimeters tall and
weighing 2,715 grams, through Caesarean section early this month,
they said.
     The father, who is in his 40s, had been completely unable to
produce sperm on his own.
     A total of nine women out of 31 who have tried the ICSI
fertilization method, but not the sperm cultivation method, have
become pregnant since the medical team started in 1992, they said.

Boy likely to get second liver transplant+

KYOTO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The ethics committee of Kyoto University's medical department
is moving toward giving the go-ahead for a live liver transplant for
an 8-year-old boy after an earlier transplant from a brain-dead
donor failed, university officials said Monday.
     In the operation, a part of the liver of the boy's mother, 34,
would be transplanted to the child.  Pending formal approval by the
panel's subcommittee on liver transplants, the surgery might be
conducted in early January, they said.
     According to the university, it would be the first time in Japan
that a live liver transplantation has been conducted on a patient who
has received a liver from a brain-dead donor in an earlier operation.
     The boy received his first liver transplant in an operation in
Australia in December 1988, when live liver transplants were still a
taboo in Japan.
     However, the boy continued to suffer from bleeding after the
first operation, prompting doctors to advocate another try with a
live transplant from his mother.
     Two other patients received live liver transplants at the
university, but they both died some time afterward.

Women urged to watch vitamin A intake during pregnancy+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Women should carefully watch their vitamin A intake directly
before and during pregnancy because overdosage can cause birth
defects, the Health and Welfare Ministry said Tuesday.
     The ministry cites an epidemiological study of more than 20,000
women in the United States, which showed that women whose daily
vitamin A intake was more than 15,000 international units (IU) were
3.5 times more likely to give birth to a deformed child than women
who had less than 5,000 IU a day.
     ''There is no reason to be overly concerned as long as one keeps
to a normal diet, but in the initial stages of pregnancy women must
avoid supplementing their dietary intake with massive doses of
vitamin A preparations or vitamin cocktails containing it,'' the
ministry said.
     Among those women who supplemented their dietary vitamin A
intake with 10,000 IU from vitamin pills or vitamin mixtures, one in
57 women delivered a child with a deformity such as hare lip or
hydrocephalus.
     In addition to refraining from taking vitamin pills and other
food supplements containing vitamin A, pregnant women should also
avoid vitamin A rich foods.
     Such foods are, for instance, dried lamprey eel which contains
some 150,000 IU of the vitamin per 100 grams, chicken liver with
47,000 IU and pork liver with 43,000 IU, according to the ministry.
     Some medications also contain the potentially harmful vitamin.
Depending on age and other physical parameters doctors recommend a
daily dietary allowance of at least 1,800 IU.
     The average daily intake in Japan stands at 2,600 IU, far below
a dosage that could be harmful, ministry officials said.
     In a bid to prevent people from taking an overdosage the
ministry is, nonetheless, considering issuing special nutritional
guidelines, ministry officials said.

UTILITY WORKS TO CHANGE NDE CRITERIA FOR
GENERATOR TUBES

In the coming months, Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)
plans to spend $3-4 million to help develop new
nondestructive examination criteria for cracked steam
generator tubing in nuclear reactors.  If approved by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the new criteria
would, for the first time, allow some circumferentially
cracked tubes to remain in service.

ComEd's action is prompted by the discovery in November
of about 2,000 indications of circumferential cracking in the
steam generator tubes of the utility's Byron-1 nuclear reactor.
Because of the extensive cracking, the utility has proposed to
pull 10 tubes from Byron-1 -- one of the largest tube pulls in
the U.S. to date.  The tubes will be used to validate NDE
crack detection and sizing techniques as well as estimate leak
rate and burst data.

ComEd will be working with the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI), which is leading the nuclear industry's
efforts to develop new plugging criteria for cracked steam
generator tubes.  Circumferentially cracked tubes traditionally
have been plugged upon discovery.  However, with
extensive cracking being found in several plants around the
country, large-scale plugging is threatening the economic
viability of some reactors.

EPRI's project to develop alternate plugging criteria is being
carried out by three contractors -- Westinghouse, Zetec, and
Aptech -- which are developing NDE techniques and stress
corrosion cracking samples for inspector qualification testing.

EPRI recently ironed out an agreement among all major
nuclear vendors on the NDE parameters for sizing
circumferential cracking in non-sleeved tubes.  The agreement
should help to yield a consistent set of inspection data when
reactors around the country undergo their next outages.

The inspection data collected during the outages, and from
laboratory testing, will be used to develop approximate flaw
growth rates for cracking tubes.  Being able to accurately
predict how fast cracks will grow is essential for reducing the
chance of a tube rupture.

The means to assess crack growth rates took on even more
importance in November when EPRI submitted a proposal to
the NRC to allow known circumferential cracks to remain in
service so that their growth rates can be tracked.  EPRI
proposed that a cracked tube could be boxed in by plugging
all the surrounding tubes so that, if a rupture occurred,
damage to nearby tubes would be minimized.  The NRC has
accepted the proposal with some reservations, but has not yet
made a final decision.

ComEd technicians hope that by pulling tubes from Byron-1,
they can gather data about crack growth rates and NDE
detection capabilities that could be applied to Braidwood-1,
another ComEd reactor.  Commonwealth is seeking to make
Braidwood a lead plant for implementation of alternate
plugging criteria for top of the tube sheet circumferential
cracking.

ComEd technicians recently found 25 indications of
circumferential cracking at Braidwood, which has a similar
design to Byron.  The utility is preparing itself in case the
extensive cracking that occurred at Byron happens at
Braidwood as well.  Braidwood-1 has two cycles and Byron-
1 has two and a half cycles remaining before their steam
generators are scheduled to be replaced.

Commonwealth has already been able to obtain an alternate
plugging criterion for another problem at Byron and
Braidwood: outer diameter stress corrosion cracking at the
tube support plates.  In November, the NRC approved a 3-
volt eddy current criterion, which is the highest to date.
NRC's traditional criteria is more stringent, requiring utilities
to plug reactor steam generator tubes when an eddy current
reading of one volt or greater is detected.

NRC's approval of the higher voltage standard included a
requirement to lock in a number of tubes into the tube support
plates.  ComEd estimates that using the higher voltage
threshold could save it from plugging 1,020 tubes at Byron-1
and 913 tubes at Braidwood-1.  This would result in a
combined savings of at least $5.7 million.

The agency's decision is an important indication that a 3-volt
threshold may come into wider use by the NRC.  Although
the criterion applied only to ComEd, Westinghouse, which
designed Byron and Braidwood, is expected to seek a generic
approval of the new threshold.

IOWA STATE DEVELOPS NDT TECHNIQUE FOR
GLOBAL INSPECTIONS

Researchers at Iowa State University have developed a new
NDT technique called GlobalView that achieves the global
inspection of objects of all sizes using ultrasound.  Its
inventors say the technique has a variety of applications
ranging from inspections of civil structures and airframes to
earth crust monitoring.

The GlobalView technique, also known as spread spectrum
nondestructive testing, combines ultrasonic testing with
technology from the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System
and radar signature analysis.  GlobalView transmits a very
wide bandwidth ultrasonic signal that floods the test object or
structure with acoustic energy.  As with traditional pulse-echo
ultrasonic systems, this signal propagates in the material and
is reflected by inhomogeneities which may be flaws.

However, unlike pulse-echo systems, which rely on the
transit time of the ultrasonic wave to locate flaws, the
GlobalView system measures the composite characteristic of
the entire acoustic system including the structure and the
transducers.  By measuring the cross-correlation functions
between the various input and output transducers, the system
can form an aggregate acoustic signature of an object or
structure.

The GlobalView unit compares the original, or reference,
acoustic signature with one taken at a later date to indicate the
presence of flaws or to determine if changes in the object
have occurred.  By taking an object's acoustic signature, the
system can detect changes in the object's characteristics such
as volume, shape, dimension, composition, density,
homogeneity, and acoustic velocity.

The signal processing used with this wideband signal is
capable of increasing the sensitivity of the measurement by
many orders of magnitude beyond what is possible with
conventional ultrasonic testing.  Thus, the instrument can
penetrate highly-attenuative materials.

Iowa State researchers, led by principal investigators Steve
Russell, Samuel Wormley, and Emmanuel Papadakis, have
built and tested two prototype systems.  The first system
mainly consists of software that is used in conjunction with
commercially-available ultrasonic instrumentation.  The
second prototype is mainly hardware, using analog methods
for most of the signal processing.

While the software approach provides maximum flexibility,
researchers say the hardware approach would be less
expensive to manufacture and would have faster processing
times.

The technique is particularly useful for inspecting objects
with "blind spots" or other geometries that prevent the use of
pulse-echo or pitch catch ultrasonic techniques.  Parts or
structures composed of high attenuation materials or with
restricted access are also good candidates for GlobalView.

Researchers have found that the technique can distinguish
between flaws because different types of changes or identical
changes in different locations show up uniquely in the
correlation signature.  GlobalView has been successful in
locating small flaws in copper blocks, small steel assembly
line parts, and large sections of bridge structure.

The developers say GlobalView will make it possible to
perform continuous, low-cost, monitoring of bridges and
airframes and other critical structures.  For example,
airframes could be automatically monitored before each
takeoff to insure structural integrity while avoiding expensive
down time for detailed inspections.

However, the technique also has applications beyond
traditional NDT tasks.  Earthquake fault zones could be
monitored for changes below the surface of the earth to help
predict earthquakes.  GlobalView could also be used for oil
exploration by creating an acoustic signal that penetrates deep
into the earth's crust.

NRC AUDITS WESTINGHOUSE FOR MISSED
INSPECTIONS

In October, a four-person team of auditors from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) visited a Westinghouse
testing facility in Pennsylvania to determine why the company
had failed to discover several obviously cracked steam
generator tubes during a 1993 inspection of the Salem-1
nuclear power plant.  NRC auditors are also seeking
information on why Westinghouse used an eddy current
probe that had not been fully qualified to inspect 4,000 tube
support intersections during the reactor's current outage.

According to Ted Sullivan, a section chief in NRC's Office of
Nuclear Reactor Regulations, the agency has prepared a draft
audit report that is due to be finalized and released to the
public in January.  Sullivan said that the site visit to the
Westinghouse facility near Pittsburgh lasted from Oct. 23rd
to Oct. 27th.

The NRC began the audit after finding out that Westinghouse
technicians had used an 0.080-inch-diameter motorized
rotating pancake coil eddy current probe to inspect dented
intersections at Salem-1.  The Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) has approved the 0.080-inch-diameter probe
to detect cracks for tube support plates without dents, but not
at dented intersections.  EPRI has qualified an 0.115-inch
diameter probe for inspections of dented intersections.

While using EPRI-qualified probes is the industry norm,
inspection vendors and utilities can also approve
independently the use of other probes for specific tasks such
as inspecting dented tube support plate intersections.
However, there is the danger that flaws may be missed unless
the proper probe and instrumentation is used.

Westinghouse is trying to get the 0.080-inch-diameter probe
qualified by EPRI, but the company will most likely have to
re-inspect Salem-1's steam generators before the qualification
process is completed.

The NRC also wants to find out why Westinghouse
inspectors failed to detect a number of tubes with greater than
40% throughwall cracks during a 1993 outage at Salem-1.
These tubes had remained in service during the reactor's
operating cycle, although they should have been plugged
prior to restart.

The NRC has had to inspect the Salem-1 plant several times
over the last few years because of numerous operational
violations.  The agency has fined Public Service Electric &
Gas Co., Salem's operator, more than $2.3 million since
1980.

PARTNERS SCORE SUCCESS WITH ULTRASONIC
SENSOR

Morton International's Automotive Safety Products Division,
based in Utah, has adapted an ultrasonic system developed by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
inspect airbag inflators for welder verification and process
control.

Morton-ASP is the leading supplier of airbag inflators to the
automotive industry.  Under a cooperative research and
development agreement, NIST's Materials Reliability
Division in Boulder, Colo., worked with Morton engineers to
develop, test and install a prototype nondestructive testing
system for verifying that there are no anomalies associated
with the weld joint process of the mass-produced inflators.

A unique feature of this inspection system was the use of
electromagnetic acoustic transducers, or EMATs, which can
perform the necessary ultrasonic tests at high speed without
contaminating the part or the environment with couplant
fluids.

Off-line trials involved examining up to 100,000 inflators and
were so successful that Morton contracted Sonic Sensors of
San Luis Obispo, Calif., to build three commercial units.
These units are now installed on the production lines and
provide process control information on the welding
operations.

NAVAL CENTER MARKETS ITS NDE EXPERTISE TO
THE PRIVATE SECTOR

As defense budgets shrink, an increasing number of military
bases and research centers are marketing their R&D efforts to
the private sector.  The newest installation to join this list is
the Naval Surface Warfare Center located in Carderock, MD,
which is hoping to provide expertise in NDE sensors,
metallurgy, welding, and structural monitoring to the railroad
industry.

At a December 7th meeting, officials from the Center noted
that Navy and railroad operations overlap in many ways.
Navy ships require high-quality welds whose integrity must
be monitored nondestructively, as is also true for welded rail.
Moreover, maintenance and machinery diagnostics are
concerns for both parties.

The Warfare Center has developed several NDE sensors such
a portable coating analyzer for substrate/coating adhesion
assessment and acoustic weld sensors.  Warfare Center
officials hope that these types of technologies can be
transferred to the private sector through the use of cooperative
research and development agreements (CRADAs).

The number of CRADAs entered into by the Center pales in
comparison to many other military installations and officials
hope that meetings like the Dec. 7th event will increase this
total.  The Warfare Center currently employs more than 4,000
people, more than half of which are scientists and engineers.
The Center's fiscal year (FY) 1994 budget totaled $767
million, which included $312 million for research and
development of test and evaluation technologies.

NDT FINDS CRACKING AT TWO REACTORS

Engineers using nondestructive testing recently found steam
generator tube cracking in the Point Beach-2 nuclear power
plant operated by Wisconsin Electric Power Company and in
the Diablo Canyon-1 plant operated by Pacific Gas & Electric
Company.

At Point Beach-2, eddy current inspection discovered axial
defects in the reactor's steam generator tubes within the
tubesheet crevice.  Circumferential cracking was also found
in the parent tube of previously sleeved tubes near the upper
sleeve joint.  The crack findings extended Point Beach's
outage, which started on October 7th, by an extra two weeks.

Previous tube plugging and sleeving had already reduced
power in the two-loop 497-MWe reactor by 10-15 MWe.
Wisconsin Electric Power has applied to the Public Service
Commission of Wisconsin for permission to replace the
reactor's steam generators during the plant's fall 1996
refueling outage.

Engineers at Diablo Canyon-1 in California recently
discovered 70 corroded tubes in one of the plant's steam
generators.  This finding pushed the number of pluggable
tubes at Diablo Canyon-1 over the threshold 1 percent of the
tubes tested.  Pacific Gas & Electric notified the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission as required by regulations and
expanded the testing program.

The testing involved extensive ultrasonic examinations and
engineers decided to pull several tubes for metallurgical
testing.

A total of 1.7% of Diablo Canyon-1's steam generator tubes
are now plugged.  The utility expects Diablo Canyon-1 to be
back in service sometime before January 30, 1996.

IN BRIEF

%  The American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT)
has a new site on the World Wide Web called "NDT Link."
ASNT can be reached at http://www.asnt.org/ndt.  The Web
site contains technical information, which is comprised
primarily of online articles from Materials Evaluation
magazine, society information, local society events, a
schedule of events, industry services, and links to other
NDT-related sites.  At this point, most of these areas lack
complete information, but hopefully in the near future the site
will be finished.

%  XiTec (Windsor Locks, CT), a leading manufacturer of
mini c-arm fluoroscopic imaging systems with applications in
health care, NDT and other industrial fields, recently reported
an increase in profits.  The company's net income for the first
quarter ended Oct. 31, 1995 amounted to $1.65 million, an
increase of 36.9% over the comparable prior year's period.
The quarterly revenue performance was the second best in the
company's history, falling short of the record fourth quarter
of last year by approximately 12 percent.  XiTec attributes its
increase in revenue to the market's continuing acceptance of
the company's XiScan 1000 track system coupled with
favorable results from increased emphasis in the marketing
and sales sectors.

%  In early December, dye penetrant inspection helped
engineers in California discover why a five-ton electronic
message board collapsed in Rancho Cucamonga, killing a
freeway motorist.  Caltrans engineers using dye penetrant
found several fractures in the signpost, ranging from
microscopic to several inches long, which were invisible to
the naked eye.  Caltrans is now inspecting each of the 228
signposts statewide.  At this point, no fractures have been
found on any other signposts.

%  With the help of ultrasonic testing, a 71-year old riverboat
is undergoing an overhaul in New Orleans, LA.  The
riverboat President is used for gambling on the Mississippi
river and is usually based in Davenport, Iowa.  Workers at
Trinity Gulf Repair will replace steel in the 297-foot
President's hull, if necessary, then sandblast and paint it.
Ultrasonic testing will determine if the bottom's steel meets
the prescribed 3/8-inch thickness.  Depending on the extent of
the repairs, the job could run as high as $750,000.

%  In early November, Asoma Instruments Inc. (Austin, TX),
a manufacturer of X-ray fluorescent analysis tools for
nondestructive testing, purchased Twin Cities Inc., which
makes products similar to Asoma's.  Asoma will provide
sales and field support for Twin Cities from its locations
around the world, while factory support for Twin Cities'
products will continue to be handled from an office in North
Tonawanda, NY.

FAA TIGHTENS WING INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

In late November, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
issued a series of airworthiness directives (ADs) intended to
improve nondestructive inspections on the wings of Airbus
A300-series, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, MD-11, and Air
Force KC-10A aircraft.

The AD applicable to Airbus A300-series transports requires
repetitive high frequency eddy current inspections to detect
cracks at the aft spar web of the wings.  The FAA's action
was prompted by reports that cracks have been found in the
rear spar web of the wings of an in-service airplane and
during fatigue testing on a test wing.

The cracking, which could result in reduced structural
integrity of the wing, occurred due to fatigue-related high
shear stress.  The directive affects 89 airplanes of U.S.
registry.

A second AD applies to McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, -30,
and -40 series airplanes, and KC-10A military airplanes.
This action requires repetitive visual inspections to detect
corrosion or cracking of the lower front spar cap and the skin
panel of the horizontal stabilizer, and repair of corroded or
cracked parts.

The spar cap must be modified according to a McDonnell
Douglas service bulletin before the accumulation of 42,000
total landings for DC-10-10 airplanes and before 30,000
landings for DC-10-30, -40, and KC-10A aircraft.  The AD
was prompted by reports indicating that corrosion, caused by
water entrapment, was found on the horizontal stabilizer in
these types of aircraft.

The FAA's new requirements affect approximately 286 DC-
10 and KC-10A aircraft worldwide, 142 of which are
registered in the U.S.  The FAA estimates it will cost
operators $20 million to comply with the AD.

The FAA also added extra inspection requirements for DC-
10-10 series planes.  In a separate AD, the agency is
requiring visual and eddy current inspections of the wings to
detect cracks in the aft spar lower cap, in certain stringer
butterfly clips on the bulkheads, and in certain fastener holes.
The FAA has found that, during fatigue testing of the wing
structure, cracks developed in these areas due to fatigue-
related stress.

The inspections must be performed before 15,000 landings
have accumulated and modifications to the affected parts must
be completed within five years of the AD.  The FAA
estimates that 53 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by
this AD, costing a total of $7.5 million for compliance.

Another AD requires eddy current inspections to detect
cracking of the upper spar angles on the left and right sides of
the wing pylons on McDonnell Douglas MD-11 airplanes.
This inspection must be repeated if an aircraft experiences an
excessive maneuver, turbulence overload, or hard landing.
The upper spar angles must be replaced by Dec. 27, 2000.
Approximately 123 MD-11 aircraft worldwide are affected by
this action.

AFTER NDT DISCOVERS PROBLEMS, NRC BOOSTS
OVERSIGHT AT MILLSTONE REACTOR

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is adding
inspectors at the Millstone Station nuclear power plant in
Waterford, Connecticut after intensive nondestructive testing
turned up several faulty welds in piping systems that need to
be repaired.

In December, the NRC decided to place both a senior resident
inspector and resident inspector at each of the three Millstone
units.  Currently, one senior resident and four resident
inspectors are assigned to the site.

The NRC's action was prompted when the Millstone 3 unit
was taken offline in late November so workers could remove
insulation in the reactor coolant system and evaluate a leaking
valve that prevents water from backflowing in a 10-inch pipe.
During the inspection, workers discovered a defective weld
on one of four 3/4-inch pipes in the instrumentation for the
reactor coolant system.  Northeast Utilities, the reactor's
operator, decided to shut down the plant to repair the faulty
weld and to replace an additional 15 welds in the
instrumentation system as a precaution.

At the same time, an intensive ultrasonic inspection was made
of 154 welds in piping systems around the Millstone 1
reactor.  Inspectors discovered 11 welds that needed repair.
The utility is now using a robotic welding process to lay new
weld material over the old weld.

In addition to increasing its oversight of Millstone, the NRC
also sent Northeast Utilities a letter requesting information on
what actions the utility has taken to ensure that future
operation of Millstone 1 will be conducted in accordance with
its operating license and NRC regulations.  According to a
statement by the NRC, this request stems from the findings
by the NRC Acting Inspector General that certain activities at
Millstone 1 "may have been conducted in violation of license
requirements."

AGEMA DEVELOPS NEW THERMOGRAPHY SYSTEM
TO SEE BELOW THE SURFACE

Agema Infrared Systems has developed a new NDT
technique called "lock-in" thermography that can spot flaws
several millimeters below the surface of a material.  Its
developers say the new technique is faster and more accurate
than active thermographic inspection techniques.

Lock-in thermography is unlike either passive or active
thermographic techniques.  Passive thermography converts
infrared radiation emanating from an object into a thermal
picture of the object's surface.

In active thermography, an energy source such as a flashlamp
is aimed at the test object and the heat flow through the
specimen is measured.  Flaws in the specimen cause changes
in the heat flow which are detected by a thermal imaging
system.

While active thermography has the advantage of being a
noncontact technique, it also has certain drawbacks.  The
technique requires several lengthy tests to eliminate the effects
of different emissivities across the surface of a material.
Active techniques such as pulse thermography must take into
consideration the effects of ambient radiation and often
require high energy levels that can lead to unacceptable
heating of materials.

Lock-in thermography was developed to overcome the
limitations of both active and passive techniques.  In lock-in
thermography, a harmonically modulated source, usually in a
sinusoidal waveform, is used to energize the test material.
Defects in the material produce reflections that interfere with
the incoming waves and create a pattern that is detected by a
thermal imager.  The imager measures the signal amplitude of
four phase-correlated points on this wave and the results are
averaged.

A computer is used to interpret the measurements picked up
by the imager and to create amplitude and phase images of the
test object that are independent of ambient radiation and
variations in emissivity.  According to Agema, amplitude and
phase images of an object can be produced in a couple of
minutes using a high-speed computer.

The lock-in system is based on Agema's Thermovision 900
thermal imaging system which produces real-time
measurements and has 12-bit digital image processing.  The
unit also includes a dedicated system controller for high-
speed data processing and specially adapted software that
coverts thermographic measurements into amplitude and
phase images.  The system produces a pure sine wave that is
synchronized with the frequency of the Thermovision 900
scanner.

Lock-in thermography is being developed in partnership with
Stuttgart University and MTU Munich, a leading German
manufacturer of turbine blades.  The technique has been used
to inspect objects like an electronic resistor and a honeycomb
structure, but the researchers are now examining a wider
variety of materials.

To date, most of the tests have been carried out at frequencies
between 3.75 Hz and 0.03 Hz, giving depth rages of 3 mm
for non-metals and 10 mm for metals.  The next stage of
development will involve adapting the lock-in thermography
system for a range research environments.

NASA EVALUATES NDT TECHNIQUES FOR
COMPOSITES

Researchers at the NASA Lewis Research Center in
Cleveland, Ohio recently completed a study that evaluated
various NDT methods for characterizing ceramic-, metal-,
and polymer-matrix composite materials.  The study found
that certain ultrasonic methods can provide quantitative data
on microstructural anomalies and that time-resolved
thermography can be a useful noncontact method for
detecting delaminations.

The researchers evaluated a method for obtaining precise
ultrasonic measurements and mapping which provides data
on sound velocities, coefficients of attenuation, and peak
frequencies of echoes.  Also evaluated was an acousto-
ultrasonic technique that generates data on velocities and rates
of decay of waves in plates.

Among the study's finding were that speeds of sound vary
with fractions of volume occupied by pores and fibers.
Researchers also determined that coefficients of attenuation
increase with degrees of inhomogeneity of volume fractions
of pores and fibers.

The researchers' results also confirmed the efficacy of using
time-resolved thermography as a noncontact, nonionizing
method for detecting anomalies such as delaminations.  The
method is particularly valuable because it requires access to
only one side of a specimen.  This allows the technique to be
used at more stages of fabrication and processing than other
NDT techniques that require access to both sides.

SALE OF HERCULES' FIRM UPSETS SEMITECH

by Lucy Reilly
Sematech officials are attempting to block the anticipated sale
of a key U.S. company to Nippon Sanso of Japan, claiming the sale
would violate a proprietary and confidential information
contract.

Nippon subsidiary Matheson Gas Products Inc. wants to purchase
Semi-Gas Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Wilmington, Del.-based
Hercules Inc. With sales of $20 million last year, Massachusetts-
based Semi-Gas is the largest supplier of gas handling equipment
to the semiconductor industry worldwide, Hercules officials said.

"Sematech feels very strongly that it is against the best
interests of the U.S. semiconductor industry and the nation as a
whole for Semi-Gas Systems to be sold to a foreign competitor
whose apparent intentions are worldwide market domination," wrote
Turner Hasty, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of Sematech, in a letter last week to David
Hollingsworth, chairman of Hercules.

Sematech is concerned that a final sale would provide inside
information on Sematech strategies to Nippon, thereby harming
national security and divulging proprietary U.S. technology
information. Semi-Gas and Sematech have been collaborating for
more than two years on technical development projects.

"Unauthorized disclosure of this information or any improper
attempts to obtain access to it will cause Sematech irreparable
harm," Hasty wrote.

Sematech General Counsel Robert Falstad, in a similar letter last
week to Nippon's legal team in New York City, wrote, "Hercules
Inc. and Semi-Gas Systems are not at liberty to disclose this
information to any third parties, including Matheson Gas Products
and/or Nippon Sanso, without Sematech's prior written consent."

Sematech is a joint government/industry consortium with 14
corporate members. The $250-million consortium receives half of
its funding annually from the Defense Department's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency.

"I want to express my deep disappointment with your intentions to
sell Semi-Gas Systems to a foreign company," Hasty wrote. "In his
Jan. 10 letter, Dr. Sam Harrell, president of Semi/Sematech Inc.,
told you of our concern about the proposed sale of Semi-Gas
Systems, particularly to a foreign concern. We offered to work
with Hercules to help you find an American buyer for Semi-Gas
Systems. We did not even receive the courtesy of an
acknowledgement of Dr. Harrell's letter.

"We understand that Hercules Inc. has refused to consider a
leveraged buyout by Semi-Gas Systems management that would have
enabled it to remain an American company," Hasty continued. "The
interests of the U.S. Department of Defense may be affected by
any sale of Semi-Gas Systems to a foreign buyer. Accordingly, we
believe that appropriate agencies of the U.S. government will
review the propriety of this proposed transaction."

BABY BELLS BATTLE BIG BUSINESS: Regional Phone Cos. Undertake
`Misinformation Campaign'

by Lucy Reilly
The seven regional Bell companies are waging a "disinformation
campaign" in an effort to alter federal policy by arguing that
the nation's telecommunications industry is becoming second rate
to international competitors, charges a group of large U.S.
corporations.

Fourteen powerful firms, operating under the banner of the Ad Hoc
Users Committee, submitted their claims to the Department of
Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration recently. The committee blasted statements from
the Bell holding companies that other nations are surpassing the
United States in network modernization programs because of
regulatory and structural impediments in the United States.

"These arguments are nothing more than an attempt by the RBHCs to
build a case for expansion of their present monopolistic
positions to include services from which they are now restricted
and to use their positions to reap even greater financial rewards
than they have to date," the committee told NTIA.

"In short, far from being second rate, the United States
telecommunications infrastructure is unsurpassed by any other in
the world," the committee's report states. "There is absolutely
no basis for believing that existing regulatory policies and
practices have impeded maintenance and improvement of the
domestic telecommunications infrastructure. The United States is
investing in its telecommunication's infrastructure at rates of
23 to 92 percent higher than in Japan and the major European
nations."

The committee includes Aetna Life and Casualty Co., American
Airlines Inc., American Express Co., Boeing Computer Services,
Electric Data Systems Corp., Ford Motor Co., General Electric
Co., Honeywell Corp., IBM Corp. Monsanto Co., Online Computer
Library Center, J.C. Penney Co., Procter & Gamble Co., and Sears
Roebuck & Co.

The Ad Hoc Committee submitted its claims along with 120 other
groups this spring in response to a notice of inquiry published
by NTIA regarding a comprehensive study on the domestic
telecommunications infrastructure.

The majority of respondents want to revise the nation's
telecommunications policy. In particular, an abundance of state
governments and small companies filed wish lists for introducing
and improving the use of fiber-optic networks to rural areas.
States that filed extensive plans for comprehensive networks
include Minnesota, Tennessee and Washington.

Many submissions proposed plans for improving technological gaps
or enhancing local medical and educational programs. However,
comments by the nation's large corporations focused more on
controversial federal policies which regulate the industry.

Such policies "are burdens and critical liabilities to the U.S.
position in the global economy," wrote the National Center for
Telecommunications and Information Policy, the research and
political analysis division of the Public Service Satellite
Consortium.

"Until U.S. policymakers come to terms with these facts, both the
future of the U.S. industrial base and critical constitutional
protections embedded in our political culture will be placed in
continuing jeopardy," the division's report states.

Contrasting the Ad Hoc Committee's comments, the strongest plea
to loosen existing regulations was filed in a joint submission by
the Regional Bell Holding Cos., Southern New England Telephone
Co. and Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.

Other nations "are leapfrogging us by focusing on their own
future telecommunications needs and adopting policies to meet
these needs, whether the United States remains in the game or
not," the joint report states.

The phone companies argue that the use of private networks can
have unfair advantages for corporations using them. Private
networks can be designed to have excess circuitry. Operators of
these networks would then be in a position to resell switching or
line capacity to outside clients. Sears, Westinghouse, Merrill
Lynch, Northwest Airlines and Federal Express have spun off
telecommunication subsidiaries to do just that, the phone
companies's report notes.

The joint report urges NTIA to favor abandonment of the AT&T
Consent Decree and several other regulations in favor of
"forward-looking public policies," including:

 *  the establishment of depreciation rates that reflect the
    reality of technological change;
 *  the adoption of incentive regulations; and
 *  the elimination of cable cross-ownership restrictions, which
    ban local exchange carriers from offering video programs in
    their own territories.

AT&T agreed that policy changes are needed to end regulation of
the industry. Moreover, AT&T's comments to NTIA stated that the
U.S. government should foster competition abroad, promote
standard setting for interconnection and interoperation of
networks, adopt price-caps similar to what British Telecom did
several years ago and foster domestic research and development.

However, "the assertions that the nation's telecommunication
industry is `second best' and `falling behind' other nations are
nonsense," AT&T's report states. "This system has been planned
and built by private enterprise, not by the government, and
national telecommunications policy has been to place maximum
reliance on competition and market forces for three decades.

"Indeed, since the competitiveness policy was fully implemented
with the [divestiture of the Bell system in 1982], the
telecommunications industry has experienced economic growth,
technological innovation, and benefitted...users [which
is]...virtually unprecedented in American economic history,"
AT&T's report continues. "The decision was thus a necessary and
logical step and, indeed, the watershed event in implementing the
longstanding national competitiveness policy."

The National Cable Television Association expressed its concern
that the NTIA announcement suggested the adoption of mandatory
investment in a network to be funded by higher monthly telephone
rates levied on all citizens.

"Such a policy would create serious inefficiencies in the
delivery of telecommunications services and end up costing
average consumers billions of dollars for plant and equipment
designed to deliver services that they neither want nor need,"
the cable association wrote.

by Kimberly Dozier

Another magnetic levitation bill has been launched in Congress,
this one by Rep. Robert Mrazek (D-N.Y.), a member of the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation.

At a news conference last Wednesday, Mrazek said that if the
United States does not have its own maglev system designed and
ready to be put in place in the next three years, foreign
competitors will fill the void.

Mrazek's bill calls for $50 million in the 1991 transportation
budget for a national design competition to set the standard for
domestic maglev systems. The program would be managed by a maglev
administration set up within the Department of Transportation.
This group would establish minimum health, safety and
environmental standards for the industry, and establish safety
rules and regulations.

The $50 million would be the preliminary portion of $350 million
to be awarded to no more than six finalists in the design
competition, with an additional $600 million to be given out to
build a prototype system. The second-phase funding would be
available to any state or local government, public-private
consortium or any combination of government or private entities.
The prototype, at least 40 miles long, must comply with the
federally selected design standard and demonstrate the commercial
viability of the technology.

The funds are not meant to be the bread and butter of maglev R&D,
but a way to entice the domestic defense and aerospace industry
into joining the program. Maglev is seen by many as one of the
financial saving graces for defense contractors as they face a
decline in large military projects. Few industries, however, are
willing to risk R&D on what would be a radical departure from
today's transportation system without government leadership and
at least token financial support.

Should the program be successful, and contracts abound for
various new maglev routes around the country, industry investment
is expected to exceed the original $950 million from the federal
government. Mrazek predicts that maglev could become a $30-
billion to $60-billion industry.

Mrazek said that though he and others were disappointed by the
$6.1 million for maglev R&D in Transportation Secretary Skinner's
budget request for fiscal year 1991, he does not anticipate
administration roadblocks to the proposed legislation. He added
that he doesn't expect maglev to be a hard sell in Congress,
since many congressmen represent areas with companies that would
benefit from the program.

A growing number of bills are floating around on Capitol Hill
that favor maglev, including Sen. Ernest Hollings' (D-S.C.)
S.2236 which would require the Department of Transportation to
support more maglev research and foster a maglev system, and Sen.
Daniel Moynihan's (D-N.Y.) bill that would initiate maglev R&D
under the Federal Highway Administration's jurisdiction. Mrazek's
bill is the first to call for a federal maglev agency, and create
a competitive program both for prototype design and corridor
location.

FIRST CLEAN COAL RESULTS IN

The first test results are coming in for the $5-billion
government-industry Clean Coal Technology program, Department of
Energy officials say. An advanced pollution control process that
works inside the ductwork of existing coal-burning power plants
has met its design objectives, removing up to 70 percent of the
acid rain-causing sulfur pollutants from the exhaust gases of a
high-sulfur coal-burning plant in Ohio.

The $19.4-million project could lead to commercial use of the
"Coolside" technology, developed by Consolidation Coal Co. of
Pittsburgh. Coolside, an alternative to the more costly scrubber
technology, is the first of two processes to be demonstrated by
Babcock and Wilcox Co. of Alliance, Ohio, to control pollution
from older utility generating stations.

"The key advantage of the Coolside process is that by using the
plant's existing equipment to capture pollutants, it avoids the
need to build large, costly add-on scrubbing vessels," says
Robert Gentile, the Energy Department's Assistant Secretary for
Fossil Energy. "This is especially important in smaller or older
plants that are tightly spaced or have short remaining operating
lives. And, because the process operates downstream of the
boiler, it does not affect boiler performance and can be used on
a wide range of boiler types and sizes.

The Coolside process works by injecting sulfur-absorbing hydrated
lime powder into the combustion gases after they leave the coal
boiler. A mist of water droplets, along with sodium-based
additives, are sprayed into the gases as they move through the
plant's ductwork. The lime particles absorb the sulfur pollutants
which are then captured by existing particulate collection
devices. The water mist improves both the level of sulfur removal
and the performance of the particulate collection equipment. The
process produces a dry, disposable waste product, rather than the
wet sludge typical of today's scrubbers.

U.S COCOM PROPOSAL MAY FREEZE OUT USSR

by Aviva Freudmann
The U.S. government's Defense and Commerce departments are
finalizing a proposal for a two-tier approach to relaxing
controls on high technology exports to the Soviet bloc. The plan
calls for more liberal rules for Eastern Europe than for the
Soviet Union.

The Bush administration's aim is to introduce new rules at a
"historic" meeting of the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) in Paris on June 7 and 8.
The proposed two-tier structure will be the subject of talks next
month between the U.S. and its Western allies.

U.S. Commerce Department Undersecretary for Export Administration
Dennis Kloske, the point man for U.S. export control policy, told
a business conference last week that there is "an emerging
consensus" in the administration favoring the two-tier approach.

His remarks followed disclosure, two weeks earlier, that the
Defense Department had decided not to block exports of many U.S.
computers to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, thereby
allowing the Commerce Department control over the sales. The move
was seen as a victory for the Commerce Department, which has
pushed for sole authority to monitor high technology sales.

In his remarks last week, Kloske stressed that the proposed two-
tier export regime means that Eastern European governments will
have to introduce controls to prevent re-export of Western
technologies to  the Soviet Union.

Kloske also said that West Germany, in particular, should pay
more attention to ensuring that its high technology exports to
East Germany do not end up in Soviet hands.

The reason for retaining controls on high technology exports to
the USSR is fear that they will be used for military purposes.
The U.S. is not opposed to relaxing the rules on sales of
civilian non-strategic technologies to the Soviet Union, Kloske
said.

But trade experts quoted by Reuters say that Soviet officials are
unlikely to stand by idly while the rest of the Warsaw Pact
countries catch up with Western technology.

The Soviet Union "has been able to get its hands on much of this
technology for years, even when it was restricted," said Randy
Bregman, director of Soviet and East European services for Apco
Associates, a Washington-based consulting group.

Many of the export controls have more political than practical
value, he added. If Hungary or Poland acquires certain new
technologies, it won't take long for the know-how to show up in
the Soviet Union, in spite of formal controls, he said.

Western manufacturers have much to gain from relaxing controls on
exports to the Soviet Union because of that nation's large
market potential compared with Eastern Europe, Bregman added. He
said that keeping formal controls in place would cause the Soviet
Union short-term difficulties, particularly as it tries to
modernize its backward telecommunications system.

The Soviets use a phone system that is more than 30 years old. It
has only about 10 phone lines per 100 people, a ratio lower than
that in Hungary, East Germany or Czechoslovakia. This compares
with 90 phones per 100 people in the U.S., and 60 lines per 100
in Western Europe.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said recently that the
United States would agree to exports of 10-year-old telephone
technology, which he said would help the Soviet economy. However,
the older technology would force the Soviets to use an analog
dial-up system rather than the digital push-button technology now
common in the West.

Mosbacher, speaking in West Germany, explained that United
States policy is to support perestroika, "but the reality is that
[the Soviets] have the potential to be a great military threat."

The use of 10-year old technology is not likely to be acceptable
in the Soviet Union, argued Stepan Pachikov, a Soviet computer
scientist who heads ParaGraph, a joint venture with a U.S. firm
that publishes Moscow's first computer newspaper.

"If we wanted to just upgrade 30 or 40 percent of our phone
system, then the answer would be `yes,' 10-year-old technology
is good enough," Pachikov said.

But he pointed out that Western nations had a tough time of it
when they tried to adapt their analog phone systems to digital
computer transmissions. "If we want to communicate adequately
with the West, then the equipment on both sides of the line must
be equal."

The head of ParaGraph's U.S. partner, IDG, agreed that export
barriers are increasingly unenforceable. On a recent trip to
Hungary, IDG president Patrick McGovern learned from government
officials that returning Hungarian tourists had brought with them
at least 70,000 computers of the sort that appear on CoCom's
restricted list.

DOE CONSIDERS FOREIGN PARTICIPANTS IN SSC

by Lucy Reilly
The Department of Energy is considering a controversial proposal
to accept bids from foreign companies to construct the magnets
for the $8-billion Superconducting Super Collider. Ideally, DOE
(and its contractors) would prefer direct financial contributions
from foreigners, but foreign governments "would prefer to
participate in the hardware as opposed to simply outright grant
of cash," says Russ Wylie, director of external affairs at the
SSC site headquarters in Dallas.

U.S. industry executives are concerned that if the SSC contracts
are opened up, they won't be able to compete against foreign
companies who often are bankrolled by their own governments.

"Foreign companies operate under a subsidized umbrella and will
be able to underbid U.S. industry and run away with the whole
ball of wax," says Carl Rosner, president of Intermagnetics
General Corp. of Guilderland, N.Y.

The companies that are thought to have the best chances of
landing contracts to make the magnets for the SSC include General
Dynamics, Westinghouse, Grumman and Italian-based Ansaldo.
Ansaldo has hooked up with Grumman in pursuit of an SSC contract.

The request for proposals for the magnet portion of the SSC are
expected to be released in the next few weeks. A total of 10,000
magnets, worth an estimated $1 billion, will be used in the
collider.

The exclusion of foreign firms could generate further conflict
for the United States, which recently began negotiations with the
European Community to conduct joint research in several areas of
technology. In addition, closing the process to foreigners may
not bode well for U.S. officials, who have been pushing for other
nations to open access to their consortia and industrial
contracts.

"I think there are other ways [the government] can get sufficient
funding" without having to open bidding to foreign firms, said
one industry source. "It's unlikely in the initial stages of the
project that DOE will open the floodgates. For the U.S. to be
competitive, it needs to keep some of the technology inside."

SUPERCOMPUTER RESEARCH PICKING UP IN TENNESSEE

Using a new massively parallel Intel supercomputer at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory as a hub, officials at Oak Ridge and
the University of Tennessee are setting up a cluster of new
research institutes. The institutes, which receive backing from
major computer companies, will carry out research in physics, the
environment and computer sciences.

The effort is designed to bring supercomputer-based research in
Tennessee to the same level as other high-tech oriented states,
especially neighboring North Carolina and Alabama.

Use of the Intel iPSC/860 machine instead of the more common Cray
non-parallel supercomputers should also give the state a lead in
parallel processing techniques, says Jack Dongarra, who is
directing the new computer studies program.

Dongarra, who left the Argonne National Laboratory last September
to take a joint Oak Ridge/University of Tennessee position, says
use of the lower cost parallel processors appears to be a more
efficient way to produce supercomputing power than the Cray
approach which uses more expensive single components. The new
Intel machine costs $3 million compared to at least $20 million
for a Cray.

"We take the long-term view that parallel processing is not a fad
but is here to stay," says Dongarra. "We believe that what we are
starting to do here is the way supercomputing will be done in the
future."

Intel unveiled the iPSC/860 in January saying it provided high-
speed processing at one-tenth the cost of industry leader Cray.
Besides Oak Ridge, NASA's Ames Research Center in California has
received one, and some large corporations including Ford Motor
Co. and Prudential-Bache Co. have placed orders.

The new Oak Ridge machine, delivered in January, has 128
processors or separate nodes arranged to work together. Working
at full capacity, using a "hypercube" networking principle, it
can perform 5.2-billion operations per second (5.2 gigaflops).

It replaces an Intel-PSC/2 machine which has 64 processors and is
not classified as a supercomputer. The Oak Ridge lab "traded in"
the older computer when it bought the new one, but Intel has
decided to donate the older machine, worth about $500,000, back
to the University of Tennessee.

Thus, says Dongarra, the new Computational Sciences Institute
will be able to use the smaller machine to do preparatory
research for projects involving the larger supercomputer. Oak
Ridge itself has had a parallel processing research program since
1984 based on the smaller machine.

The new institute, with a start-up budget of $500,000, will
concentrate on developing new algorithms for parallel processing.
It also will develop graphics applications for use with parallel
processors.

At the same time, it will work with the other joint institutes to
tackle several "grand challenges," including world climate
modelling andd superconductivity theory, says Dongarra. In these
cases, the computer group will lend special expertise to the
other research groups when they get stuck on problems.

The Computational Sciences Institute has recently held talks with
both IBM and Digital Corp. which could lead to corporate funding
for some of the research.

The Oak Ridge/University of Tennessee project that is farthest
along is the Institute for Heavy Ion Research, created in 1988.
This group has focused on the behavior of atomic nuclei under
stress using supercomputer techniques.

As a side effect of the heavy ion research, the institute has
proposed a new gamma-ray detection device, the "gammasphere," and
has been selected by DOE as the preferred site for building the
$16-million machine.

A second joint physics research unit, the Institute for High-
Energy Research, is being started by Oak Ridge and the University
of Tennessee. This institute will focus on building detector
equipment for the Superconducting Super Collider and developing
SSC experiments.

Oak Ridge officials have recently started efforts to bring work
on the proposed L-Star SSC detector to the lab using the new
institute as a means of attraction.

Another joint institute, still in the planning stages, would
perform research in both the energy and environment fields,
complementing work on greenhouse effect problems underway at Oak
Ridge. The supercomputer would be used particularly for
atmospheric modeling.

University of Tennessee officials say that the two Intel machines
give them direct access to a level of supercomputer power that is
rare for most universities. They hope this will give their
researchers an advantage in winning research funding.

At the same time, the new computational sciences institute is
looking forward to the purchase of an improved supercomputer with
1,024 parallel processors and a capacity of one-quadrillion
operations per second (1 teraflop). The $15-million unit will be
available in two to three years.

According to Dongarra, securing a one-teraflop machine would put
the institute in a world leadership position for parallel
computing and attract additional research work from several
industrial and government sources.

ASME TO SCREEN COUNTERFEITS

Counterfeit and substandard screws, bolts, washers and other
fasteners will have a harder time making it into U.S. markets
thanks to the newly initiated American Society of Mechanical
Engineers' fastner accreditation program (FAP).  "In many
instances, suppliers provided bogus quality certifications and
other misrepresentations to their buyers," says SME. This has
lead to millions of counterfeit fasteners with have cracked,
sheared or otherwise failed in helicopters, trucks, bridges,
nuclear power plants, coal mines, tanks and other military
equipment.

SME hopes that the accreditation program will help government
efforts in stemming the flow of counterfeit goods by subjecting
would-be fastener suppliers to stringent reviews. Until now, the
Defense Department and aerospace industry had no way of
determining whether or not they were dealing with a supplier
capable of producing high strength, high quality and safe
fastener products, says ASME.

U.S. FIBER-OPTIC STRATEGY PROPOSED

The fiber-optic public interest group called "Opt In America" has
filed a formal complaint with the federal government charging
that the United States lacks vision for the future of fiber
optics. "We hear a parochial debate on process and
technique....We need a driving vision of where we want to end
up," says Opt Chairman John Eger. "We had that with telephones,
cable and broadcasting. We do not yet have that with
fiber optics."

Eger says that of 94 million homes in the United States, a scant
15,000 are scheduled for fiber-optic wiring. Meanwhile, Japan and
several European countries are moving ahead with fiber-optic
plans for homes. Opt advocates a switched, broadband fiber-optic
network to the home.

AST MARKETS COMPUTERS TO JAPAN

Irvine, Calif.-based AST Research Inc. is testing the waters of
the Tokyo marketplace with the first U.S. personal computer that
can run both the most popular Japanese and American software
packages. The company's SX/16 "will be seen as a test case of
the openness of the Japanese market," says one Tokyo analyst.
"If it doesn't do at all well, there will be a lot of harsh
words." The machine can run the many Japanese-language software
packages developed for computers made by NEC Corp., the Japanese
giant that controls about half the domestic PC market.

James Ashbrook, senior vice president of AST, says the computer
would be ideal for multinational companies that work in both
Japanese and English. Industry analysts say AST's success will
depend on how successful the company is at cultivating
distribution channels in the tough Japanese market rather than
the quality of the product.

U. WASH. MANY COLORED DISPLAY

University of Washington engineers have invented an
image-processing system that may be "the world's sharpest,
fastest and least expensive," says the Seattle-based university.
The system consists of a single circuit board for the NeXT
computer that produces images with several million colors rather
than the 256-line limit of most computers, says Yongmin Kim,
professor of electrical engineering and leader of the research.
"It executes incredibly complex functions with a speed
approximating that of a supercomputer...but will cost about half
as much to manufacture as other image-processing systems, which
sell from $65,000 to $30,000 depending on the application."

The system will have the most immediate application in medical
technology, researchers say. The computer will yield
three-dimensional, true-color X-rays, which can be manipulated to
examine all sides. "New X-rays can be popped onto the screen in
a second, and up to 16 images can be called up at once with the
push of two buttons," says the University of Washington.
Previous technology could display only one picture with poor
color resolution and difficult manipulation of the image.

Kim's team received primary funding for system development from
University of Washington with some money contributed by the Navy.
The system has been licensed non-exclusively to Daewoo Telecom
Co. of Korea, and will be marketed by Leading Edge Products Inc.
in the fall.

one-half year test of about 4,500 commercial vehicles along a
crescent-shaped route of western states. A data collection system
consisting of weigh-in-motion, automatic vehicle identification
and automatic vehicle classification equipment will be installed
in a number of locations along the route. Results will be used to
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of traffic management
by transit agencies, state and local government.

The Soviet national airline, Aeroflot, has selected General
Electric's CF6-80C2 aircraft engine to power up to 10 Airbus
Industrie A310-300 aircraft. The engine order is worth
potentially more than $150 million. "We're very excited about
this order," said Donald Morrison, director of European sales
for GE aircraft engines. "We've built a strong presence in
Eastern Europe over the past several years, and adding Aeroflot
to our customer list really solidifies our position." GE is the
only western aircraft engine manufacturer to have received engine
orders from an Eastern European airline.

AUSTRALIA: CSIRO TO LOSE NEW CHIEF - MCINTOSH TO HEAD DEFENCE DEPT

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

CSIRO will soon be seeking a new Chief Executive as a
result of Federal Government moves to switch the
incumbent, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, to the top job in the
Defence Department.

No formal announcement of the change is expected in the
near future, but informed sources in Canberra have
assured Scitech the move is definitely 'on', providing his
on-going battle with illness does not become a major
problem.

Any such transfer would make good administrative sense
in the light of Dr McIntosh's outstanding defence-oriented
professional background and would be likely to be welcomed
by the armed services. It would certainly be welcomed by
our military allies in Britain and the United States.

It would also be seen as a clear promotion for Dr McIntosh
- from running CSIRO and answering to a junior Minister
(Mr Peter McGauran) to supervising a $10 billion Defence
operation which has a Minister (Mr Ian McLachlan) inside
the Howard Cabinet.

The sources said Dr McIntosh, whose start at CSIRO
coincidentally occurred as the Coalition Government took
office, had been disappointed with the comparatively
junior status given to science by the new administration.
His feelings had not been dispelled by the Federal Budget's
bogus 'increase' in CSIRO funding (Scitech, Vol 16, No 9),
they said.

Dr McIntosh was recently announced as the head of a
special committee appointed to conduct a thorough review
of the Defence Department. It is expected that this role
will be used as the lever to subsequently appoint him as
head of the Defence Department, thereby utilising the
specific knowledge he would have gained through the
inquiry to significantly improve its vast and complex
administration.

(The review coincides with separate plans to revamp the
operational capabilities of the Army, including the transfer
of 1000 non-combat personnel to combat units).

He is expected to officially remain as chief of the CSIRO at
least until the Defence inquiry is completed. (The current
target date for the review report - and an implementation
plan - is March 10 next year).

The Government is placing great store in the results of the
inquiry, having indicated it wants to find annual efficiency
savings worth around $500 million from the Defence
operating budget. Ironically, the Government had
announced at the time of the Federal Budget that Defence
was the only portfolio which would not face some level of
funding cuts.

Mr McLachlan said the review was intended to "examine
specific management activities in Defence with a view to
eliminating needless duplication, making appropriate use
of commercialisation options, and reflect, where
appropriate, modern business practices".

He said about $5 billion of the Department's annual budget
was spent on areas other than designated combat forces
and related equipment. The emphasis of the review would
be "efficiency gains" in these areas, ranging from logistical
support "down to postage stamps and stationery".

The review committee will include: Vice Admiral Robert
Walls, Vice Chief of the Australian Defence Force; Dr
Richard Brabin Smith, Chief Defence Scientist; Mr Ian
Burgess, Chairman of AMP; Mr John Stone, former
Secretary of the Treasury; and Mr Andrew Michaelmore,
Executive General Manager, Business Development,
Planning and Technology, of Western Mining Corporation.

Dr McIntosh, 53, graduated in science (honours) from the
ANU and later obtained a PhD in physics there. His
working career started with the Weapons Research
Establishment, at Salisbury, South Australia. After serving
two years' national service (having attained the rank of
Major) he became a lecturer in mathematics and computer
science at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
(RMIT).

He joined the Defence Department in 1974 and after a
series of promotions through the Australian Public Service
became Chief of Capital Procurement in the Defence
Department in 1988, then Secretary of the Department of
Industry, Technology and Commerce in 1990.

During 1991 he became the UK's Chief of Defence
Procurement, responsible for spending $20 billion a year,
and played a major part in introducing the latest Trident
missiles to Britain's armed services. His work there was
highly praised and led to a knighthood, personally
bestowed earlier this year by the Queen. (He uses the title
only in Britain). The US Government also gave him its
highest possible civilian defence honour for foreigners, the
Medal for Distinguished Public Service, (Scitech, Vol 16, No
7) for his work in coordinating and strengthening the
defence efforts of Britain and America.

Dr McIntosh returned to Australia to takeup his
appointment as Chief Executive of the CSIRO. A Fellow of
the Royal Aeronautical Society, UK, his list of achievements
includes numerous prizes in fields including military arts
and accountancy.

Clearly, his background indicates his level of professional
interest in all areas of Defence and his level of
achievement in Australia and overseas is such that he is
eminently qualified for the post of Secretary of the
Defence Department.

It is understood that the Government has not yet
considered his replacement at CSIRO.

AUSTRALIA: SENATE QUESTIONS ON SCITECH STORY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Last month's Scitech front page story (Natural Heritage
Trust a fraud) led to questions being asked of the
Government in the Senate.

The Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator
Meg Lees, sought responses to a number of matters raised
in Scitech from the Leader of the Government, Senator
Robert Hill (see next story for full transcript).

These included statements from Scitech's source - a senior
Coalition advisor - that the trust is "a cynical political
invention and a blackmail device" and that it "is a gigantic
and disgusting sham".

Senator Lees also raised the comments of the source that
the Trust concept had been "a blatant blackmail device
created by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr
Andrew Robb; that the plan had been imposed upon
Senator Rod Kemp (the former shadow Minister for
Environment); and is now being imposed upon you
(Senator Hill)"

Other questions related to the claim by our source that
"senior Coalition MPs openly joked behind closed doors
about the policy" and that "the deceit had sickened this
particular advisor and a number of other Coalition staffers
who are genuinely concerned about the national environment
for the sake of their children and for the nation's
long-term future".

Senator Hill made no attempt to answer any of the specific
allegations, not even the suggestion that he had been
`saddled' with the Trust policy. He simply twice made brief
comments outlining the Government's usual claims about
the need for the partial privatisation of Telstra if money
was to be made available to start to rectify the continent's
many serious environmental problems - land degradation,
soil salinity, and rising water tables.

Other Government Senators sat silent throughout the
questions and the answers. Not one attempted to rebut the
allegations even by way of an interjection.

Senator Lees later issued a press release, again referring
to the Scitech front page article, in which she said the
advisor's admission had confirmed every criticism of the
Trust concept which had come from the Australian
Democrats.

Senator Hill issued no press release on the allegations and
has apparently made no public comment on the matter.

Despite the Government's public silence it started a major
internal search for the source of our story, with a number
of people being wrongly accused by Coalition Ministers,
MPs, Senators, and staffers alike.

Scitech even received a call from a long-time Liberal Party
acquaintance (an advisor in a very high office) willing to
volunteer `nominees' while trying unsuccessfully to learn
the identify of the source. Again, there was absolutely no
questioning of the accuracy of the story.

During the subsequent debate on the Telstra (Dilution of
Public Ownership) Bill, some days later, Senator Lees again
repeated many of the claims published in Scitech,. Yet
again, there was no denial of the details from the
Government.

AUSTRALIA: TRUST QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The official Hansard record (see story above) is as follows:

Senator Lees: My question is to the Minister for the
Environment. What is your reaction to the following two
direct quotes from a magazine published today? The first
one is: The linkage to the environment is just a sop,
designed to cloud the Telstra sale issue and to try to
blackmail other parties and the general community into
accepting it. The second one is: A lot of the opponents of
the Telstra sale have long suggested the Natural Heritage
Trust was a cynical political invention and a blackmail
device. Some have also suggested it was a creation of Mr
Robb. They have always been correct on both counts,
despite the Government's continuing denials. It is time the
community was told the truth - the Natural Heritage Trust
is a gigantic and disgusting sham.

Senator Hill: I suppose we will learn in the supplementary
question the source of the quote. The answer of course is
that this Government is intent on reinvesting a large sum
of money in the natural capital of Australia. The time for
that is overdue. Through ignorance, in particular, we as a
nation have done enormous damage to our natural
environment. We have failed to appreciate how fragile it
is. We adopted European farming practices, for example,
without understanding fully how they would affect our
streams and our soils. As a result of that, there is now
very severe degradation, salinity, and rising water tables -
a lot of major damage that is going to take a very large
sum of money to remedy.

The Government, of course, needs to obtain that sum of
money. There are only two real sources. For the former
Government, it would have been to borrow more. They
borrowed literally billions more than they raised. I guess
you borrow or you tax more, or you sell an asset and
reinvest part of the capital proceeds of that asset in this
particular task. That is what we have chosen to do - a very
legitimate policy decision to sell one-third of Telstra, a
telecommunications company, and to reinvest $1 billion of
the proceeds of that sale in our natural environment. I
personally do not see any sham in that. It seems to me to
be a sound policy, sensibly based and something that is -
certainly, the need to remedy, the need to reinvest the
capital - strongly supported by the majority of
Australians.

What is interesting is that, as the debate develops, even
the funding source of it is becoming supported by many,
many more Australians. I hope that in the next few weeks
the Senate will see fit to support the Government on its
piece of legislation to provide that capital fund, and that
we can then go about doing something really worthwhile
for the natural environment that previous Governments
have not been prepared or able to do.

Senator Lees: I thank the Minister for his answer, but
what we are looking for is a decisive commitment. If I can
just advise you that the magazine I quoted from is Scitech
magazine, published today, and the quote has actually
come from a senior Coalition advisor.

What is your reaction to his revelations - again, I am
using his words - that the Telstra link is a gigantic and
disgusting sham; that it's a blatant blackmail device
created by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party,
Andrew Robb; that the plan was imposed upon Rod Kemp
and now is being imposed on you; that senior Coalition
MPs openly joked behind closed doors about the policy;
and that the deceit had sickened this particular advisor
and a number of other Coalition staffers who are
genuinely concerned about the national environment for
the sake of their children and the nation's long-term
future? This is really a question about the seriousness of
this Government's failure to do something about the
problem.

Senator Hill: The Honourable Senator gives me one more
minute to urge upon her to take an action that will really
benefit the Australian environment and therefore accord
with the wishes of the Australian people; that is, support
the sale of one-third of Telstra and help set-up this $1
billion fund to reinvest in the natural capital of Australia.

Yes, Senator, we will continue to support the environment
through recurrent expenditure, but what is now needed is
more - what is now needed is the reinvestment of a very
large capital sum. If you work together with us, if we put
that $1 billion in place, we earn income on that $1 billion,
and we add that to our normal recurrent expenditure, we
could provide an annual appropriation over the next five
years of very substantial sums of money that could make
a difference to vegetation, to streams and waterways, to
the national reserve system, to coasts and seas, and that
would be something very worthwhile for you to do.

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Thank you to all our subscribers who responded to the
survey published in our August edition. We were well
pleased with the response rate and the level of positive
feedback.

There was a very strong indication of the types of
information you want from Scitech and over the coming
months we will be increasing our coverage of these
important areas at the expense of those you told us were
less popular.

The most frequent negative comment, from a minority of
respondents, was that Scitech is taking a political stance.
We have no preference for any political party and we
believe it is our responsibility to report on the activities of
whatever government is in power, the reactions of the
community we serve to these activities (especially where
these are against the message that the government is
seeking to portray) and to make informed analysis and
comment. However we will in future clearly distinguish
comment from reporting by introducing an editorial
column (see back page), which a majority of respondents
indicated would be of interest to them.

There was also some interest in an annual index. To
accommodate the needs of people who wish to reference
articles in Scitech we have decided to make the entire
contents of the 1996 editions available on disc in ascii text
so they can be searched using any text retrieval software.

The price of this is $100 for customers who subscribed
prior to January 1996 and $350 for non-subscribers (a
discount is available for those who started their
subsciption in 1996). Please contact Michaela Baer at our
office for details.

AUSTRALIA: DEPUTY PM PLEDGES SUPPORT TO SCIENCE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, has pledged
that the Howard Government will give continuing support
to science and technology - and its Labor predecessor's
ambition of establishing Australia as "the clever country".

His remarks came during a speech to the Australian
Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering
(AATSE) last month on the topic: Science and Technology -
A Vital Part of the APEC Agenda.

"The Australian Government is working to ensure that
developments in science, technology and engineering are
serving the interest we, and all nations, have in improved
standards of living. And we are pursuing, through
international organisations, the strengthening of a world-
wide intellectual property regime", Mr Fischer said.

"Science and technology are integral to discussions about
improving economic performance and strengthening
economic cooperation. One of this century's major lessons
is that the economic performance of a nation cannot be
isolated from its performance in science and technology, or
its investment in R&D. The fact is that science and
technology are vitally important to good economic
performance.

"Since the turn of the century, per capita incomes in the
OECD nations have increased sixfold in real terms. Most of
this increase comes as a result of increased productivity
and this, in turn, is usually generated by increases in
knowledge and technical advancements. And, of course,
increased knowledge and technical advancements are
driven by developments in science, technology and
engineering - the link is clear and well understood", he
said.

Mr Fischer said the Coalition recognised the importance of
international transfers of knowledge and technology to the
competitiveness of local industry. This was essential
because the majority of the world's breakthroughs in R&D
occurred in only five countries - the US, the UK, Japan,
Germany and France. Smaller countries, including
Australia, made valuable contributions to scientific
knowledge, often in specialised fields. Australia had
specialised advantages in several areas - natural resource
science, agricultural technology, geoscience, and ecology.

"The Coalition Government fully understands that science,
technology and engineering are central to advances in
productivity and new product development. Science and
technology underpins Australia's economic future in an
increasingly competitive world.

"The Government is committed to making the most. of
Australia's undoubted excellence in key areas of science,
technology and engineering R&D. We are also committed to
encouraging free and fair international access to scientific
and technological developments. Australia's reputation as
an innovator is well deserved - and it is due to the efforts
of those here, and all your colleagues, that we can be
proud to call Australia a clever country", the Deputy PM
said.

AUSTRALIA: MCGAURAN RUNS AWARENESS PROGRAM

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government's $2 million Science and
Technology Awareness Program appears to have a bright
future, at least in the short-term.

This follows the decision of the Minister for Science and
Technology, Mr Peter McGauran, to take effective personal
control of the scheme. Informed sources in Canberra
suggest there are two elements to that decision: it will
help to promote community awareness of the benefits of
science and technology expenditure and it is a good way
for the Minister to raise his current level of media
exposure.

Meanwhile, officials responsible for the day to day
administration of the scheme have called for applications
for grants in 1997. They said: "We are looking for fresh,
new ideas to raise the profile of science, engineering and
technology, to change the way Australians thinks about
these vital areas of endeavour - and to capture the
interest of young Australians".

Information/application kits are available through the
Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, Canberra.
Tel: 06 276 1714. Fax: 06 276 2002. Applications close on
December 23.

Editor's note: Mr McGauran is extremely ambitious,
regarding himself as a good chance to ultimately become
Leader of the National Party. He has quickly established a
reputation in relevant circles as an extremely energetic -
and approachable Minister. But he is also known to be
somewhat frustrated by his present junior status in the
Howard Ministry.

The science awareness program provides an excellent
vehicle for the Minister to promote himself to the
community and to the media. It allows him to choose from
a long list of "goods news" items (research projects and
scientific breakthroughs) which are of widespread interest
and which are unlikely to attract the cynical response
which many other political activities can engender.

AUSTRALIA: CHIEF SCIENTIST: FASTS CONCERN

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Coalition Government's plans to permanently change
the role of Chief Scientist to a part-time appointment (now
rumoured to be one day a week!) has raised concerns
within the science community.

The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological
Societies (FASTS), which represents a total membership of
40,000 across both fields, has publicly questioned the
move.

The President of FASTS, Dr Joe Baker, has admitted there
could be some benefits to the concept of appointing a
scientist who is still actively working beside research
colleagues in the field for much of the time. He said this
would maintain real links with the science community and
help to avoid the new Chief Scientist from becoming
bogged-down within the structure of the bureaucracy.

But there are many minuses involved in the idea, Dr Baker
said. The most obvious was the logistical impossibility of a
one-day a week Chief Scientist effectively keeping abreast
of all relevant developments across "the sprawling world
of Australian science in sufficient detail to offer credible
advice to the Government".

The issue is to be discussed at the FASTS Council meeting
later this month. The Minister for Science and Technology,
Mr Peter McGauran, will attend a session of the Council
and Dr Baker has indicated the Minister will be questioned
on the matter.

No date for an announcement of the new Chief Scientist
has yet been determined but Canberra sources believe it is
imminent.

AUSTRALIA: SCIENCE FUNDING AND CSIRO 'SAFE'

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Science funding - and the existence and operations of the
CSIRO - are likely to be maintained in coming years,
according to the CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm
McIntosh.

He also predicted a continuation of Government-sponsored
schemes to help promote industry R&D and an
evolutionary change in the existing structure of
Government (State and Federal) research activities.

These ideas emerged when Dr McIntosh gave the Brodie-Hall
Address in Perth last month.

He said: "The first prediction I'll make is that Governments
in Australia, particularly Federal Governments, but I think
probably also State Governments, will continue to support
science strongly. Now you might think that's a pretty rash
sort of a prediction to be making, but if you look back over
the past few years, by and large, State and Federal
Governments have given science a fairly prominent place.
And in the last (Federal) Budget, when this was a
reforming conservative Government dedicated to massive
slashes in outlays, science was one of the few areas to
survive relatively intact.

"The university system as a whole was cut, but science in
universities was preferentially protected - not completely,
but preferentially. The amount of money put through the
research grants process for universities was increased for
science infrastructure.

"CSIRO was sustained at about the same level of funding -
there were some interesting ups and downs (Scitech, Vol
16, No 9) but it survived with about the same money and
has an opportunity to increase its funding in some
interesting constructive ways.

"Now all of this happened at a time when the Government
was taking $4 billion off in the first year and another $4
billion in the second. That says that somebody in the
Government at least felt science was worth funding and I
think it will persist into the next century," Dr McIntosh
said.

"The second thing I will predict is that the structures will
change, however slowly. State Governments are getting
out of extension services and by and large they are
changing the structures. We, among others, are finding
ourselves in the position of being heavily pressed for
mergers, take-overs, joint-ventures and other mechanisms
that would have the effect of progressively, over time,
changing the research structures in Australia.

He said: "There is a serious set of discussions going on in
that way with a number of the States, and I would guess
that in due course this will go for the Federal agencies as
well.

"The third prediction I would make is that we are by no
means at the end of the schemes designed to encourage
R&D. I think the tax schemes are dead because of the
recent history regardless of whether that is a good or a
bad thing. I believe it will become clear that the other
schemes are not necessarily doing all the things that were
done before and it will probably take two or three rounds
before we have schemes which by popular acclaim are
likely to generate the sorts of internationally-competitive
R&D that we need. So I suspect that is not too stable.

"If all of that happens - and I say that is what I believe is
most likely - then I think we are likely to have quite a
positive environment for R&D in Australia," Dr McIntosh
said.

"The final comment, or prediction if you like, is that CSIRO
will continue in much of its present form. Now that's a
pretty rash prediction indeed. There are two ways that
could be untrue. Firstly, the Government could do to CSIRO
what New Zealand did to its equivalent body (DSIR) -
break it up into little pieces that mirror major activities
and then flog them off or privatise them, or whatever.

"I don't see any evidence of that happening at the
moment, and as long as CSIRO is actually contributing
through large multi-disciplinary sorts of activities, I think
there is a compelling case not to do so. We now have this
almost unique institution, only the French have anything
like it. We have this almost unique capability in the world
to tackle large problems and I think we'll keep it.

"The other thing that could be seriously threatening to the
existence of an organisation like CSIRO is not so much that
we would break it up or change it internally, but that we
would actually starve it to death. Again, I see very little
likelihood of that happening," he said.

AUSTRALIA: UNION'S POST-BUDGET FEARS EASING

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Assurances from the Howard Government and CSIRO
senior management have partly allayed fears within the
CSIRO staff union that widespread sackings and asset sales
would follow this year's Budget allocations.

The Secretary of the CSIRO Division of the Community
Public Sector Union, Mr Peter O'Donoghue, told Scitech he
was "never 100 percent certain" that CSIRO would manage
the loan of $60 million in a way that would not adversely
impact of its staff. Now he feels less concerned about the
immediate future of his members than he did at the time
of the Budget announcement.

He had been pessimistic about the likely impact of the
Budget because of the Government's announcement that it
was increasing funding when it was actually taking back
the 'extra' money (Scitech, Vol 16, No 9).

"I was fearful that the organisation might spend the so-
called extra money without making adequate provision for
repaying it down the track. If that happened I could not
see that asset sales would recoup the money and I feared
there would have to be widespread sackings as a result,"
Mr O'Donoghue said.

"Since that time I have had discussions with the CSIRO
Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh. Following those
talks I feel less apprehensive than before, but we always
have to remain wary to protect the interests of our
members.

"Apart from our concerns about the Budget arrangements,
we have been anxious for our members and jobs due to
proposals by the Government to considerably reduce
CSIRO's cash reserves. In the meeting with Dr McIntosh he
said discussions with the Government on this matter had
been positive but a final decision had not yet been
reached.

"The union is seeking a meeting with the Minister for
Science and Technology, Mr Peter McGauran, in order to
obtain assurances on this." Mr O'Donoghue said.

Environment monitoring technology developed by CSIRO is
to be used extensively by a major consultant company
working throughout Indonesia.

The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John
Moore, announced the sale and hailed it as a possible
precursor to worldwide adoption of the Australian system.
Licensing of the technology for CSIRO is being handled by
a Queensland firm, Comserve Australia Pty Ltd. It has
signed a joint marketing agreement for Indonesia with a
the Jakarta-based PT Ramatelino Perdana Consultant. The
Minister said the deal was a first for CSIRO and for private
sector organisations in Australia and Indonesia. He said
the leading-edge technology would assist authorities in
Indonesia to properly plan strategies for land-use, water
storage, and population management.

AUSTRALIA: ENVIRONMENT'S NEW NAME

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Five major groupings within the Department of
Environment, Sport and Territories are to be identified in
future as Environment Australia.

The Minister for Environment, Senator Robert Hill, said he
regarded the new name as an important symbolic change.
He said: "It recognises that environment functions have
reached a point in their history where a new approach is
needed to achieve the aims of the Government."

The departmental groups to be combined within
Environment Australia are:

* Australian and World Heritage Group (combining the
functions of national and international heritage).

* Environment Protection Group (consolidating existing
environment protection functions with additional
responsibilities, such as climate change and Greenhouse
activities).

* Biodiversity Group (combines several major components
including biodiversity conservation, sustainable land and
water use, and reserve and wildlife management).

* Portfolio Marine Group (to reflect the Government's
priorities in this area, coordinate coasts and clean seas
programs, and develop an overall marine policy for the
Commonwealth).

* Environment Priorities and Coordination Group (will
support the Environment Executive on international,
economic and environment information matters, and will
manage major cross-portfolio activities).

Senator Hill said the restructure would not impact on the
statutory functions and independence of statutory advice
from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service
(ANPWS) or the Australian Heritage Commission (AHC). He
said policy work will be focussed in the Department with
the authorities concentrating on their statutory wildlife,
parks and heritage protection responsibilities.

The new structure will become fully operational later this
year, following the development of sectional structures for
each functional group. This process would involve
consultation with staff, he said.

The Minister has also announced the names of the Senior
Executives of four of the five groupings. They are: Ms
Sharon Sullivan (Australian and World Heritage Group); Dr
Peter Bridgewater (Biodiversity Group - and Director
ANPWS); Environment Priorities and Coordination Group,
Mr Phillip Toyne; and Dr Ian McPhail (Portfolio Marine
Group - and Chairman, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
Authority). He said the head of the Environment
Protection Group would be announced in the near future.

AUSTRALIA: INSECT SUSPECTS IN VIRUS ESCAPE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Research into the unauthorised spread of rabbit calicivirus
from its island testing site off South Australia in October
last year has reinforced suspicions that insects were
responsible.

A range of genetic tests undertaken at the Australian
Animal Health Laboratory have found that a range of
insects, including bushflies, blowflies, and mosquitos, are
capable of carrying the virus.

Molecular tests on 16 separate groups of insects captured
in areas where the disease had become established found
that 13 groups carried some evidence of the virus and one
carried live calicivirus.

The CSIRO was seriously embarrassed by the 'escape' of
the virus while it was allegedly undergoing intensive
testing to ensure it would not harm humans, livestock, or
native fauna.

Although not yet conclusive, scientists regard the tests as
a good indication that the rapid spread of the virus from
Wardang Island to all mainland States and Territories had
been essentially caused by insects. (There are some
theories that outbreaks of the virus in isolated rural
districts in NSW were the result of anxious farmers
trading in the carcasses of diseased rabbits to overcome
delays in the official approval for its release).

Meanwhile, the Minister for Primary Industries and
Energy, Mr John Anderson, has officially approved the
release of the disease at 280 locations throughout
Australia (NSW, 50 sites; Queensland, 50; South Australia,
50; Victoria, 50; WA, 40; NT, 30; ACT, 5; and Tasmania, 5).

Officials in Tasmania have refused to participate in the
program - at this stage - pending the results of further
testing on its wildlife species because of fears the virus
could produce unexpected results.

Farmers and wildlife officers working in regions where the
virus has now been established for up to 12 months have
reported a staggering reduction in rabbit numbers and the
relatively fast re-establishment of many native shrubs,
trees, and grasses - some of which had not been commonly
seen for many years.

The release program is seen as a major boost to the
national environment by cutting rabbit numbers, thereby
reducing erosion and related problems caused by over-
grazing and the spread of underground warrens. Similarly,
native animals will face less competition for food and
shelter, and farmers will have more grazing capacity for
their livestock.

It has been officially estimated that direct environmental
damage and lost farm production due to rabbits (pre-virus)
totals in excess of $650 million a year.

Opinions are divided about the effects of the anti-rabbit
scheme on populations of feral animals, such as foxes and
cats. Some experts feel their numbers may be reduced by
the reduction in rabbits as a food source but others
believe this will lead to an increase in feral animals
hunting small native species.

The Executive Director of the former Environment

This news has emerged in the midst of sweeping Howard
Government changes to the structure of Federal agencies
responsible for environmental and heritage issues (Scitech,
Vol 16, No 10). These included the abolition of the EPA.

The Minister for Environment, Senator Hill, publicly

while revealing the latest restructure details. He simply
said: "Mr Barry Carbon, Executive Director of the former
Environment Protection Agency will be retiring from the
Australian Public Service. Mr Carbon has made a
significant contribution to the portfolio during his period
as Executive Director".

The departure of Mr Carbon from the bureaucracy has
surprised many Canberra observers, particularly since he
is understood to have signed a new contract only three
months ago.

adequacy of the EIS. The auditor's role will require some
degree of public interaction and this will happen where
appropriate. The auditor's report on the draft EIS will be

AUSTRALIA: TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE "OLD" FORESTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A new high-tech solution to identifying tracts of old
growth trees within logged forests is under development
by CSIRO, State Forests (NSW), and the timber industry.

The airborne unit uses digital cameras to record infra-red
light emitted from forest areas and this data can later be
processed by computer into colour-coded maps of the area
surveyed. Fast-growing trees (new growth) show up as
red and slow-growing (old growth) are shown as green or
blue.

A major cause of dissension between pro-logging and anti-
logging groups is the argument that old-growth forests
require special protection for the sake of biodiversity,
providing sanctuary for endangered native species, and
maintaining areas of `pristine forest' for future
generations.

The system is currently undergoing field tests in forests
surrounding Bateman's Bay on the NSW South Coast.

AUSTRALIA: R&D WILL STOP - OR GO OFFSHORE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government's numerous changes to the R&D
tax concession and its eligibility criteria will have a serious
negative effect on Australian industry, according to two
major independent surveys of business intentions.

Both found that a large proportion of respondent
companies had indicated that the reduction from 150
percent to 125 percent in the tax concession rate would
make the majority of companies reconsider plans for
future R&D projects. Many firms expressed concern that
the reduced concession, combined with a significant
increase in related compliance costs, would adversely
affect the economics of undertaking the work in Australia.

Some would seek to take advantage of the more-generous
range of concessions available in countries such as
Singapore and Malaysia, while others would simply seek
to import technology already developed overseas.

The studies were undertaken by Price Waterhouse
Technology, through the Australian Industry Research
Group, and by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.

The Price Waterhouse survey was sent to 250 strategically
selected companies which were likely to be affected by
the range of Budget changes to the R&D concessions. These
covered such industry sectors as mining and resources,
high technology, telecommunications, building, food,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing. Responses
were received from a number of leading Australian
companies as well as many SMEs.

The executive summary of the survey found:

* Two-thirds of respondents said the (former) concession
had been a major factor in their investment in R&D.

* Following the changes (lower benefit, higher compliance
costs) more than half would reduce their R&D effort by 20
percent or more, or switch to offshore R&D, or
subcontracting.

* More than 65 percent of respondents say they will need
to change or improve their systems to take advantage of
the new concessions within the new six-month lodgement
deadline.

* Overall, the cost of compliance as a percentage of the
available tax benefits, is expected to rise by 114 percent.

* At the same time the level of R&D benefits will fall by an
average of 45 percent.

* Almost half of the respondents had serious concerns
about the level of service provided by AusIndustry.

* The results suggest that R&D in Australia may again
"decline to the inadequate levels of the early 1980s,
indicating a clear need for a reconsideration of
Government policy in this area".

The second study involved 125 responses to surveys sent
by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to 395 large to medium
companies across Australia.

It found:

* 40 percent of respondents believed the concession
changes would have a negative impact on their future R&D
activities.

* 56.8 percent of companies currently claiming the
concessions would think again concerning future R&D
because of the reduced concessions.

* 24 percent of respondents said they would now seriously
consider moving their R&D offshore to locations such as
Singapore and Malaysia. (It described this as "the most
concerning implication of the survey" because only 46.4
percent of respondents had been aware of the R&D
concession schemes in Malaysia and Singapore. The
number of companies aware of the offshore possibilities
was steadily increasing as a result of the controversy
surrounding the Budget changes and this appeared likely
to ultimately increase the number of Australian companies
which would seek to relocate their R&D efforts overseas).

* 34.1 percent of companies which had claimed local R&D
benefits over the past five years would now consider
moving those operations offshore.

* 29 percent of respondents said they would continue to
undertake local R&D but would no longer find it
worthwhile to claim the reduced concessions because of
the effects of the higher compliance costs and the reduced
benefits available.

The survey states: "There is no question that reducing the
concessional rate of the R&D concession to 125 percent will
have an immeasurably detrimental impact upon the
amount of R&D being carried out by Australian companies.
It is certain that the reduction in the amount of R&D
conducted in Australia could lead both to an increase in
unemployment and a decrease in taxation revenue
collected by the Government, Further, the reduction will
affect both the amount of the Government's taxation
revenue and the Australian economy on many other
levels.

"The most obvious and detrimental of these will be the
steady movement of corporate R&D operations offshore,
particularly in high technology growth industries. It will
inhibit growth in Australian business and render the
'clever country' significantly less progressive and
technologically second-rate. Further, the reduction in the
concessional rate will encourage more companies to
purchase technology from foreign countries, sending more
and more potentially taxable Australian dollars and capital
offshore. The effects of this sort of flow will have serious
and potentially irreversible consequences for the
Australian economy.

"The reduction in the concession rate is actively dissuading
Australian companies from undertaking R&D activities. In
doing so the Government is sending a clear message to
companies that, despite its rhetoric, the Government is not
willing to properly support R&D activities conducted in
this country. The proposed 125 percent R&D tax
concession cannot compete with other OECD countries
despite the Budget's claims to the contrary. This simple
fact will ensure irreversible damage to Australia's future
whilst assisting our neighbour countries in their economic
and technological growth".

AUSTRALIA: CSIRO CHIEF ENDORSES CUTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The general thrust of the Howard Government's cuts to
R&D tax concessions have been supported by the CSIRO
Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh. This emerged
during a major speech in Perth in which he expressed
confidence in the future funding of science and the CSIRO.

Dr McIntosh said some Budget measures (such as the
abolition of R&D syndication) had been necessary because
of their very high cost to overall revenue.

He said: "It's a fascinating reflection that when the
Government abolished the syndication R&D tax scheme
and lowered the level of assistance through the ordinary
tax scheme from 150 percent to 125 percent, one of the
fundamental issues was whether 125 percent was enough
to retain the serious R&D in Australia.

"Another was whether we would now be out-competed,
particularly by the Asian enthusiasts for R&D, even of
Australian firms. The judgement was made by the
Government that 125 percent was sufficient.

"The case of syndicated R&D was a more complex set of
discussions. The overwhelming impression, as the
Treasurer so colourfully put it, was that the taxation
syndication system had been heavily rorted. Heavily
rorted is not a term that a taxation syndicate R&D user
like CSIRO would use; it's not something you would say
about your customers, "Dr McIntosh said.

"But clearly it was, at the very least, an economically
inefficient scheme - I mean that in the sense that the
amount of tax revenue forgone to generate a given amount
of R&D was very high. There is no doubt the tax
syndication scheme did generate extra R&D (CSIRO was a
positive beneficiary of that), but it was also true that it
cost an awful lot of forgone revenue.

"My own memory is that when the scheme was first
introduced I met a senior businessman in Australia at the
time and I said the scheme would lead to a major increase
in R&D in companies. He replied that there would actually
be a major increase in accounting activities to redefine all
operations that could possibly be deemed to be eligible to
obtain the benefits which would flow from such actions -
and that is what happened.

"There was an apparent major surge in R&D with no extra
R&D being done, at least initially. Over time that changed
quite significantly and we reached the point where the
most difficult decision was how to change the scheme
without throwing the baby out with the bath water. What
the Government decided to do was create a scheme which
was no longer tax-based but which retained most of the
ingredients of the syndication R&D scheme," he said.

Dr McIntosh said the importance of the syndication
scheme was that it had attracted a number of major
players into the area of R&D, including a finance house
which had learned that the risks in such investments
(with the taxation benefits) were commensurate with
those in housing, construction or the stock market. It had
also attracted major overseas players who could supply
enabling technology to help local firms leapfrog over
existing technology and develop worthwhile new ideas.
The scheme had also involved local companies which
intended to exploit the products and processes developed
under the scheme and a local "do-er", such as CSIRO, which
would undertake the actual R&D.

"It was, in many cases, the combining of those players that
was more important than the mere fact that the R&D was
being subsidised in some way.

"What we and others are now trying to do is to convince
the Government that the new Start program needs to have
the combination of characteristics needed to attract the
same group of players, rather than providing a single
grant which would attract the Australian player alone, but
which would not attract the enabling technology and
which would be most unlikely to attract the financial
institution. We really need a mechanism out of the grant,
loan, and interest rate subsidy scheme which puts all that
back together," Dr McIntosh said.

He predicted that no administration would be likely to
return to a tax-based R&D scheme "for another generation"
because of the Government's complaints that the
syndication scheme had been "rorted so heavily".

"Those of you who remember the Whitlam Government
will remember that the administration of its various
programs poisoned the well for that sort of scheme for a
generation and I think the same would be true this time.
But we do have an opportunity in the replacement
schemes to get many of the same characteristics and those
in the field might like to think about how they would
argue their design to the Government so these sorts of
schemes can survive," Dr McIntosh said.

AUSTRALIA: GOVT'S URGENT OIL SEARCH PLANS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Official estimates that Australia has only 14 remaining
years of proven domestic oil reserves have triggered
urgent efforts by the Howard Government to tackle the
problem.

Officials are currently reviewing existing arrangements for
promoting oil exploration to determine what changes are
needed to bolster search programs.

The Government is concerned about the potential
ramifications of local oil supplies running dry - it could
cripple most sections of primary and secondary industry
or add enormously to our annual import bill, thereby
making our exports less competitive on world markets.

Canberra sources have told Scitech the 14 year estimate is
genuine but industry experts are confident there are new
oilfields awaiting discovery in Bass Strait and along the
north-west and northern coasts of Australia.

(Current estimates are that the world has 43 years of oil
reserves, based on known fields and present consumption
trends.)

The dilemma for the Government is deciding what to do
and when to do it. Current levels of oil exploration are
quite high even with existing incentives. And the industry
would be expected to have a vested commercial interest in
maintaining - or expanding - those programs to ensure
continuity of supply in the years ahead.

But some officials fear the industry may try to take
advantage of the looming domestic oil drought by delaying
some programs in the hope that community and business
pressure would force the Government to open its
chequebook and offer much more generous exploration
incentives.

According to the Canberra sources the Government is most
likely to `hasten slowly' - working hard in the background
to develop a range of appropriate measures, but delaying
any formal announcement or implementation until at least
the time of the next Federal Election campaign. This is not
due for another 2-1/2 years.

The Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Warwick
Parer, recently received a draft green paper on a
sustainable energy policy. The final document is expected
to be made public within a few weeks.

Senator Parer said in a subsequent speech: "Of the figures
I have so far, the one that really set the red light flashing
with me was the situation with our existing oil reserves.
With current production rates, and assuming there are no
new discoveries, we've got only 14 years of oil in this
country.

"We have to accept these are accurate figures, put them on
the table, throw them open to discussion, and we have to
work out a policy for how we handle this over the next 20
years," he said.

The Minister said he believed Australia was still "under-
explored", including the continental landmass itself. It was
probably true that most of our prospective new fields
were offshore but there was still ample scope for dryland
exploration across Australia.

The Deputy Director of the Australian Petroleum
Production and Exploration Association, Mr Peter
Cochrane, said putting a figure on existing oil reserves was
"extremely difficult". He agreed that Australia was still
under-explored. Bass Strait production was beginning to
wind-back as the known reserves were being depleted but
"it's not a worry as long as the Australian exploration
regime remains competitive - and we continue to explore
thaose areas the industry believes are prospective", Mr
Cochrane said.

AUSTRALIA: $10M WIND-POWER PLANT FOR NSW

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australia's first grid-connected wind-powered electricity
generating plant is to be built in NSW over the next 12
months at a cost of $10 million.

It will generate about five megawatts of power, estimated
to meet the normal needs of some 3500 homes.

The NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister, Mr Michael Egan,
said the project had resulted from five years' research of
wind patterns at the chosen site, Crookwell (near
Goulburn) in the southern tablelands region. He said it was
hoped the project would encourage more investment in
renewable energy projects as a means of lessening
Greenhouse problems.

The facility, described as a wind-farm, will comprise eight
600kw pitch-regulated wind turbines - three-bladed
propellers mounted on 40 metre towers. They will be built
on elevated ground on a local farm by Pacific Power, one
of the three NSW power-generation bodies established
recently when Mr Egan split the former Electricity
Commission into competitive units.

A local electricity distributor, Great Southern Energy, is a
partner in the project.

The power produced at the site will be channelled into the
State grid, unlike Australia's only other wind-farm (a
stand-alone 2 megawatt local facility at Esperance in WA).

AUSTRALIA: BUDGET CHANGES SLASH ENROLMENTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The extensive package of higher education changes in the
Federal Budget are being blamed for a significant
reduction in preliminary numbers of school-leavers
seeking admission as students for 1997 in some States.

The worst-hit region is NSW and the ACT where first-
round entry applications for next year have seen a drop of
as much as 30 percent from the levels recorded 12 months
earlier. The problem seems to have affected mainly the
smaller institutions -the Universities of Sydney and NSW
recorded drops of around two percent.

But the reduction in applications elsewhere in NSW has
generally been substantial. Examples include: Australian
Catholic University (30 percent), Macquarie (around 20
percent), Wollongong (16 percent), Western Sydney (14
percent), New England (10 to 15 percent), Charles Sturt
(11 percent) Newcastle (10 percent), and Southern Cross
(six to 12 percent).

The ACT figures are also down substantially - ANU (17
percent) and University of Canberra (14 percent).

Collation of these figures has been made difficult because
of a series of administrative problems which have beset
the Universities Admissions Centre which processes
applications for most NSW and ACT universities.

Preliminary 1997 application figures from other States
vary widely, with Queensland's institutions expected to
record (final) increases of up to eight percent. A smaller
rise - around two percent across the board - seems likely
in Victoria. There is no significant change in enrolment
trends in WA, and a very mixed result in SA (Flinders
University has seen a 17 percent increase but the
Universities of Adelaide and South Australia have fallen
slightly).

Observers have blamed the combination of Federal Budget
cuts to some areas of higher education, the big increase in
HECS charges for students starting next year and beyond,
the crackdown on eligibility for Austudy, and moves by
universities to cut courses and staff numbers for the fall-
off in applications. There is still no apparent explanation
for the variation in the trend among the States.

AUSTRALIA: NTEU: UNI CUTS UNNECESSARY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The significant cuts to jobs, facilities, and courses at most
NSW universities in 1997 are unnecessary and do not
reflect the level of funding available to the institutions,
according to the National Tertiary Education Union.

The senior industrial officer with the NSW branch of the
NTEU, Mr Chris Holley, said extensive research undertaken
by the union had found there was no justification for the
range and extent of the proposed cuts already announced
by the universities.

He said half of the 10 institutions had actually received
small increases in their Federal Government funding for
next year when compared with the 1996 figures, ranging
from one percent to three percent. And those which had
been cut had only lost between 0.2 percent and 1.7
percent, hardly requiring the extensive programs of
campus closures, staff cuts, course reductions, and limits
on student numbers which have been announced by some
NSW universities.

Mr Holley said the university administrators behind the
cutbacks had apparently been using the adverse publicity
surrounding the Federal Government's new priorities in
higher education as an "excuse" to do more than was
actually needed to tighten their own budgets. Similarly,
they were attempting to "blame" a long-delayed pay rise
for academic staff for cuts which went well beyond the
level necessary to cover that cost.

The various cuts had also been determined without any
apparent regard for the potential additional income which
was now available to universities by admitting full fee-
paying local students, a source of revenue previously
denied to them by earlier Governments, he said.

According to the NTEU study, the five NSW universities to
suffer cuts in 1997 are: Sydney (Allocation $306.5M; down
0.2 percent), NSW ($233.9M, 0.8 percent), UTS ($134.8M,
0.2 percent), Macquarie ($102.7M, 0.2 percent), and New
England ($84.7M, 1.7 percent).

Those which will have more Federal money are: Western
Sydney ($177.4M, up 1.8 percent), Newcastle ($136M, 1
percent), Charles Sturt ($91.3M, 1.1 percent), Wollongong
($88.1M, 1 percent), and Southern Cross ($48.6M, 3
percent).

AUSTRALIA: STUDENTS: VANSTONE MUST GO

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Student organisations around Australia have called for the
resignation of the Minister for Employment, Education,
Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone,
over her involvement in the "Wright family" saga.

The Minister received front page publicity in national
newspapers when she gave a Senate Committee details of
the "millionaire family" which she said had been abusing
the Austudy system by arranging their financial affairs so
they could receive benefits for their children. Senator
Vanstone said the case had been made public (only the
name had allegedly been changed) to demonstrate the
need for a tough crackdown on Austudy eligibility criteria,
as proposed by the Coalition's first Federal Budget.

The Minister has subsequently been forced to apologise to
the Senate on several occasions as different elements of
the original story were found to be wrong - including the
fact that the family had been a "composite", based on
several things which the Government had feared "might"
be abused.

The Federal Opposition has - unsuccessfully - demanded
that the Minister resign or be sacked by the Prime
Minister for misleading the Parliament. It has now been
joined by student organisations incensed by the various
education cuts and fee increases imposed on the higher
education sector by Senator Vanstone through the Federal
Budget.

A spokesman for the National Union of Students, Mr Van
Badham, said: "All Australians have been lied-to by the
Minister - Senator Vanstone's behaviour is unfit for her to
continue to hold Ministerial office".

The Education Officer of the University of Melbourne
Student Union, Ms Felicity Martin, said: "Thousands of
genuine Australian families will suffer real hardship as a
result of the changes Senator Vanstone has introduced -
and which she has attempted to justify through the
vilification of a bogus millionaire family. She must go".

AUSTRALIA: AFTER LITERACY - NUMERACY FEARS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Following recent controversy about high rates of illiteracy
among Australia's high school student population, there
are fears in academic circles that a forthcoming report on
numeracy and science skills could be equally bad.

The President of the Australian Mathematical Societies
Council, Ms Jan Thomas, said: "We are bracing ourselves
for bad news later this month. That is when the Australian
Council for Educational Research will release the findings
of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMSS). This has assessed the skills of children at three
age levels - 9, 13, and 16 - across some 50 countries".

Ms Thomas said the Australian body had decided to start
taking action to review teaching of maths and science in
Australia even before the TIMSS results were announced.
"We are not just waiting for the figures - we have already
arranged a top-level forum at the Academy of Science, in
Canberra, to identify three priority items for urgent
Government attention. It will bring together government,
industry, and education groups - all parties with a real
interest in the future of science and mathematics
education in Australia".

The forum will be staged on November 20. The Minister
for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs,
Senator Amanda Vanstone, and the Minister for Schools,
Vocational Education and Training, Dr David Kemp, have
agreed to speak on the day. Other confirmed speakers
include: Dr Jan Lokan, the Australian coordinator of TIMSS,
and Professor John de Laeter, a member of the Australian
Science, Technology and Engineering Council.

AUSTRALIA: AUST FEES WEST'S HIGHEST

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Howard Government's proposed higher education
charges are the highest in the western world, according to
the Australian Democrats.

Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, of South Australia, said the
increases listed in the Government's Higher Education
Legislation Amendment Bill would, if passed into law,
place Australia behind only South Korea on the world list
of such charges. She said the legislation sought to recoup
60 percent of the cost of providing higher education
services to a student - double the World Bank's
recommended maximum figure.

"The World Bank, in 1994, prepared a report - Higher
Education: the Lessons Experience - which recommended
that students in higher education should not be charged
more than 30 percent of the cost of providing their tuition.
But the Coalition has not only ignored that suggestion, it
has decided to force Australian students to repay double
that figure", the Senator said.

She urged the non-Government majority in the Senate to
use their numbers to block the legislation, thereby sparing
students the consequences of its implementation.

AUSTRALIA: TWO SATELLITES IN ORBIT BY 2001

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australia is now planning to have two locally designed and
built satellites in orbit by 2001.

This follows the Federal Government's announcement of a
$1 million feasibility study into the development of the
ARIES-1 (Australian Resource Information and
Environment Satellite), the world's most advanced
minerals exploration technology.

The remote-sensing satellite will be based on developments
by CSIRO over the past 20 years. The concept uses 256
different frequencies to permit observations which can
effectively strip away layers of vegetation and then closely
check the earth beneath for telltale signs of mineral
deposits in the target area It can also be used to check the
condition of vegetation cover, effects of land degradation,
and a range of other environmental applications.

The Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Peter
McGauran, said the Federal Government will contribute
$300,000 to the feasibility study and a consortium of 10
international mining companies will each provide another
$75,000. He said the project, to be headed by CSIRO, would
also involve Auspace Ltd, and Government Geological
Surveys.

"ARIES-1 is the most ambitious - and potentially the most
commercially rewarding - space project ever undertaken
in Australia. It will offer the most effective means of
mineral exploration anywhere in the world and will
dramatically improve on existing worldwide capabilities
for geological mapping, environmental monitoring, and
land use assessment. It will even have far-ranging defence
applications," Mr McGauran said.

"The level of involvement of the private sector, in
particular the high level of interests from foreign
investors, is to be applauded and encouraged.

"ARIES-1 will be the first Australian built and launched
low Earth orbit satellite and represents a major step
forward for the construction of high-technology systems in
Australia. The Howard Government has saved the
Australian space program from certain extinction - under
the direction of CSIRO it is now headed in a more-focussed
and more-responsible direction than under Labor," he
said.

The Coalition Government had earlier announced (Scitech,
Vol 16, No 9) plans to spend $2 million a year over five
years to design and build an Australian micro-satellite
which would be put into orbit in 2001.

A spokesman for Mr McGauran told Scitech the ARIES-1
venture was quite separate from the earlier
announcement.

The CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, said the
basic technology which would enable ARIES-1 to perform
its revolutionary range of tasks had been developed and
enhanced over the past 20 years. Earlier versions had
been carried in aircraft but the time had come to utilise
new developments in micro-technology to build these
capacities into a small satellite.

He said: "Two things about this project are new and special
- one is that we have been able to design such an
advanced piece of instrumentation and the other is that
we are doing the project on a commercial basis. The
traditional way of doing these things is to go to
Government and try to nip into the taxpayers' pockets to
the tune of $100 million or so.

"The Government's pockets are closed at the moment for
those sorts of things, so the choice was either to abandon it
or do it as a serious commercial venture. It is being done
as the latter and Australian companies are now
sufficiently mature and far-sighted as to handle the risks
and to see what benefits it would bring for them to put up
money, at least for the feasibility study.

"If all goes well we would then expect them to put up
money for the production and implementation phase and
Australia will have its first satellite for 20 or 30 years -
one which did little more than beep in the sky." Dr
McIntosh said.

RUSSIA'S 'DELICATE' SPACE DILEMMA

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Russian space officials - and their two Cosmonauts
currently aboard the Mir space station - are desperately
trying to develop an appropriate policy to overcome a
very fundamental problem with the spacecraft.

A combination of factors has meant its sewage storage
tanks are almost full and there is no immediate prospect
of them being emptied. (This task is normally undertaken
by service ships which regularly resupply the space
station and carry sewage and other wastes away for
dumping in space).Technical problems have prevented
regular services for some time and Mir is not equipped
with a dumping system of its own.

To compound the Russians' embarrassment, Mir is
currently playing host to a US Astronaut. And ground
experts have suggested the only short-term solution to the
problem is to physically stir the sewage tanks to lower
existing levels.

The Cosmonauts have so far resisted these suggestions in
deference to the sensibilities of their American visitor,
whom they fear may not have undergone the degree of
training they feel would be necessary to cope with the
smell.

According to Izvestia, the American visitor's "lifetime of
experience may not have prepared him for such
experiments"!

AUSTRALIA: LABOR: GOVT DESERTS INDUSTRY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Opposition has accused the Coalition
Government of having "abandoned manufacturing
industries" and thereby endangering Australia's economic
future.

The shadow Minister for Industry and Regional
Development, Mr Simon Crean said the new administration
in Canberra appeared prepared to sacrifice them on the
altar of market forces. He was speaking at a forum
organised by the Metal Trades Industry Association
(MTIA) in Canberra.

"It has become apparent that there is one overriding
philosophy driving the Coalition - they believe there is
no role for government in manufacturing and so many other
areas," Mr Crean said.

"The first Howard Budget saw a wholesale abandonment of
the government-industry partnership that Labor and
industry had so painstakingly built-up over the previous
13 years. DIFF, EMDG. the R&D tax concession, Austrade,
AusIndustry, the bounty on computers, ships, books and
robotics - measures put in place to help Australian
manufacturers adjust to lower tariff barriers - were axed.
But the most astonishing thing is the fact that the
Government has not even attempted to justify these
decisions, other than as a financial cut,'' he said.

Mr Crean said the Opposition recognised two things which
the Coalition did not: "there is a role for government in
industry policy and there is not a level playing field" He
said money spent on industry programs should be properly
seen as an investment in the nation's future prosperity,
and not merely as a budget cost.

The ALP was currently formulating an updated industry
policy which would include some crucial criteria:

* it must increase net exports in value-added products.

* it must be industry driven.

* it must involve building and maintaining infrastructure
(using Commonwealth and private sectors funds).

* it must involve a Government-industry partnership (to
ensure a proper balance between structural intervention
and market discipline).

* it must encourage an internationally competitive
environment which confronts the need for industry
support and entry barriers imposed by our trading
partners.

Mr Crean said the Opposition, against this background,
would continue to resist such Budget measures as
restrictions on R&D concessions and the abolition of
bounties.

AUSTRALIA: SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT CARD

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australia's first credit card for small and medium business
operations has been launched by the Commonwealth Bank.

Known as the Capital Business Card, it is claimed to offer
such companies easier and cheaper credit on a continuous
basis than other traditional forms of business borrowings.

Accounts, which operate along the same lines as personal
Bankcards, can be established by approved applicants on a
secured or an unsecured basis. Credit limits can range
between $2000 and $100,000.

A business must have been in operation for at least two
years, and be deemed creditworthy, to qualify. An
establishment fee is payable but, other than incurred
interest, there are no other account fees or charges.

The initial maximum interest rate has been set at 14
percent per annum for unsecured accounts. Secured
accounts may carry a lesser rate. The minimum monthly
repayment requirement is 2.5 percent of the outstanding
balance, with a minimum repayment of $75.

A spokesman for the bank said the new service had been
designed to suit the needs of sole traders and small firms.
He said a recent survey by the bank had found that 88
percent of small business proprietors questioned
purchased goods by telephone and 41 percent said they
paid bills by credit card over the telephone.

"The survey results show that many people in small
business use their personal credit cards for business
purposes, partly for the sake of convenience. Our new
business card is expected to prove very popular because it
offers the same degree of convenience while allowing
personal and business expenditure to be separated", the
spokesman said.

AUSTRALIA: COALITION DISAPPOINTS SMES

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A major economic survey of the reaction of small business
to the change of Government in Canberra has found that
86 percent feel things are worse - or have not improved -
since March.

The September Quarter Small Business Health Index study,
undertaken by AGB McNair on behalf of the Australian
Society of Certified Practising Accountants (ASCPA),
checked the attitudes of 450 businesses across Australia.

Only 13 percent said economic conditions had improved
under the Coalition administration. This compared with 64
percent who felt there had been no change and 22 percent
who said the business environment had deteriorated.

Despite those results, 21 percent of firms said they
intended to take-on extra staff over the next 12 months
while only five percent indicated they would be cutting
staff numbers. The remaining 73 percent said there would
be no change to their staffing levels.

The quarterly survey, which has established a sound
reputation since its inception in June 1993, is a blow to the
Howard Government which has placed great emphasis on
the supposed speed and scope of its moves to assist small
business.

AUSTRALIA: $4.5M FOR EMR HEALTH STUDY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government has reversed its earlier stance
and announced a $4.5 million five-year study into the
health effects of mobile telephones and other
radiocommunications devices.

The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator
Richard Alston, and the Minister for Health, Dr Michael
Wooldridge, jointly announced the decision to thoroughly
examine all relevant issues, including the effects, if
any, of mobile telephone towers.

This follows a long campaign from community groups who
claim the rapid spread of mobile telephone technology
throughout Australia should be held in check until it is
proven to be no risk to community health.

The Ministers stressed they had no specific concerns about
the safety of the new technology - the study was merely
being undertaken to ensure that all relevant matters were
properly scrutinised. (Senator Alston subsequently
lampooned calls for the suspension of new tower
construction until the study findings were available).

The project, to be undertaken by the National Health and
Medical Research Council, will be funded through an
increase in radiocommunications license fees - to take
effect this month. The Ministers said individual projects
under the overall study would be contracted to
appropriately qualified Government and non-Government
agencies, such as CSIRO, universities, and major hospitals.

Soon after the local investigation was announced US
authorities released details of a three year study by 16
prominent scientists into more than 12,000 previous
research projects into EMR around the world. (The group
had reduced the original mass of studies down to a 'short
list' of the 500 deemed to be most relevant to their study).

It found that there was no conclusive evidence in any of
the international research efforts to directly link EMR with
any specific health risk.

Even in the case of childhood leukemia, which has been
indirectly linked to residential proximity to high tension
powerlines in a number of studies, the US experts found
no direct causal link. They said they had paid particular
attention to childhood leukemia in the course of their
investigations into EMR research because of the numerous
past suggestions that its incidence rose sharply among
children whose homes were adjacent to overhead
transmission lines.

But their review had found not only that there was no
direct link between the lines and leukemia but there were
several other "possible causes" of the incidence of the
disease among those children who lived near them - such
as the use of herbicides and insecticides to control
vegetation and insect pests along the powerline routes.
The childhood leukemia issue required more specific study
because none of the mass of studies done to date had
produced conclusive results which could explain the
connection.

The mass of EMR studies undertaken around the world is a
clear reflection of the level of scientific and community
interest and concern about the rapid spread of radiation-
emitting devices. Governments, power authorities, and
relevant manufacturers and transmission agencies are in
the invidious position of facing massive pressure to
introduce more and better technology while some critics
allege this (radiation emissions) poses enormous health
hazards to every section of the community.

Should researchers ever find conclusive proof of a major
EMR health hazard from the spread of modern technology,
the social, economic and legal ramifications are too vast
and too complex to contemplate.

AUSTRALIA: LOCAL COMPANY LEADS WORLD GIANTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A small Australian company, with only 16 staff, has
developed world-leading PC technology which it claims
has left competing multi-nationals at least two years
behind.

Amlab International, based in the Sydney suburb of Lane
Cove, has produced a virtual instrument - a multi-use
hardware and software package which can replace a wide
range of scientific measuring devices across a broad range
of activities (eg vibration, speed, temperature,
respiration).

The system won the inaugural Science Product Innovation
Award at the recent Science 2000 exhibition.

According to the company, the Amlab system, directed
through a Windows-based PC operating system, can
effectively replace traditional measuring devices in
situations ranging from training Olympic athletes to
testing advanced military aircraft. The system enables the
operator to customise the type of instrumentation
required at the click of a mouse. It is claimed to have
almost limitless applications.

Amlab is currently working on a Defence Department
contract as part of the design process for a new simulator
for the Army's Blackhawk helicopters. The system is
already in use with BHP Research, Hawker de Havilland,
Australian Flight Testing Centres, Queensland University of
Technology, Southern Cross University, Sydney University,
University of NSW, Westmead Hospital, the University of
Technology Sydney, and the Australian Materials Research
Laboratories.

Established only seven years ago, Amlab has until recently
concentrated its marketing efforts locally and, as a result,
the system is already installed at 170 sites across
Australia. Last month the company despatched its first
shipment to Japan for use in biomechanics research. The
companie's managing director, Mr David Rosenbaum, said
the Australian device was at least two years ahead of the
technology available from rival multinationals. Its greatest
advantage was its capacity to collect and process data in
real time, he said.

AUSTRALIA: MINISTER: HEED THE "2000 COMPUTER BOMB"

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australian industry needs to recognise the potential threat
of the "Year 2000 Computer Bomb" - and to take
advantage of the commercial opportunities it presents,
according to the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr
Peter McGauran.

Many computer users, mainly those in SMEs, were still in a
state of denial about the problem, or seemingly unaware
of it. Mr McGauran said: "Companies that refuse to
properly prepare for the new millennium are risking
financial ruin - it is estimated that up to 90 percent of
computer systems will fail, or revert back 100 years, come
January 1, 2000. This is because many current software
programs were not designed to accept the change in
calendar dates which the new century will bring. The
Government is actively examining the possible impact of
this problem on its systems and urges the IT industry to
help make the community aware of the situation".

He said although the potential ramifications were very
serious the "Computer Bomb" also posed a significant
business opportunity for companies which could develop
solutions and market them around the world.

AUSTRALIA: SMART CARD PRIVACY CONCERNS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Smart card technology will not achieve its full potential in
the Australian marketplace unless the privacy needs and
concerns of consumers are fully addressed, according to
the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Peter
McGauran.

He told a recent industry conference in Sydney the Federal
Government supported the new technology but was also
anxious to ensure proper privacy protection was in place.
This was necessary if the public was to have full trust in
the cards.

"The Asia-Pacific is potentially the world's biggest market
for smart card technology and Australia is well-placed
geographically and technologically to capitalise on this
revolutionary concept. But, to be successful, these
technical advancements will have to be balanced with
appropriate standards and consumer protection
mechanisms. The Government will soon release a code of
conduct for the industry - a world first for this technology
- which is based on the values and attitudes expressed to
us by the Australian community," Mr McGauran said.

GERMANY: WORLD'S FIRST SOLAR/DIESEL CAR

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A major breakthrough in motor vehicle technology - the
world's first hybrid solar/diesel production car - has been
announced by the German company, Audi. The concept is
based on using its pollution-free solar-powered electric
motor in city conditions, switching to an efficient low-
pollution diesel motor on long haul journeys in country
areas. The company claims the new vehicle, the Audi A4
Avant Duo III, will help reduce city air pollution problems,
help conserve dwindling world supplies of oil, and be
cheaper to run than a conventional car. Another element
to the package is a separate solar-powered recharging unit
which stores electricity during daylight hours for transfer
into the car's batteries at night. This unit can also be used
to divert excess power into the domestic electricity grid,
reducing domestic power bills and contributing to reduced
demand for future power station capacity.

AUSTRALIA: ACADEMY ATTACKS QUANTUM

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Australian Academy of Science has issued a statement
criticising two recent editions of the ABC television
program, Quantum, which were devoted "primarily to the
hazards of vaccination". It said a sister program on ABC
Radio, The Health Report, had given a balanced coverage of
the benefits and limited risks associated with vaccination.
The Academy said vaccination had proven itself over 200
years to be "the most cost-effective procedure in
medicine". Yet, "the main message of the Quantum
programs was that all vaccinations are potentially
dangerous". The Academy said smallpox had been
eliminated worldwide as a direct result of vaccination and
polio was expected to be wiped-out by 2000 if current
programs remained in place, closely followed by measles.
It said Quantum had raised claims about neurological
problems developing in some patients treated with
whooping cough vaccine and paralysis developing in some
after receiving Sabin polio vaccine. Official figures showed
the incidence of such problems was one case in 200,000
(whooping cough) and one case in between one million and
five million (polio), the Academy said.

BRITAIN: BAD NEWS ON MAD COW

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Exhaustive tests in Britain have apparently confirmed that
nation's worst fears - direct links between mad cow
disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy: BSE) - and a
new variant which has infected and killed humans.

To date a total of 12 Britons and one French national have
died. The tests were conducted by researchers at the
Imperial College School of Medicine, and their results
published in the journal, Nature.

They showed that a "corrupted" brain protein, prion, in the
human victims showed the same biochemical signature as
that found in cats, mice, and monkeys which had died
after contracting BSE.

The findings have huge ramifications for Britain's
population which seemingly was being sold BSE-
contaminated beef for many years while Government
authorities blocked vital information from being released
to the public, while giving assurances that the industry's
practices were "totally safe".

directly from the vessel into airfreight containers. Senator
Parer praised the company for its efforts in helping to
boost Australian fisheries into an export industry now
worth more than $1.3 billion a year. There was ample
scope for a substantial expansion in exports to Asian
markets and other sectors of the industry should follow
the lead of Woods Fisheries in achieving recognised levels

AUSTRALIA: GOVERNMENT'S SHAMEFUL SILENCE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government's response to Scitech's front page
story last month (Natural Heritage Trust a fraud: Coalition
senior advisor admits) underlines the accuracy of our
information.

Large sections of the article were read into the official
record in the Senate during questions directed to the
Government Leader in the Upper House, Senator Robert
Hill, but he made no attempt to deny any of the specific
allegations. This included the direct claim that the Trust
policy had been a "cynical political invention" of the
National Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb,
and that it had been "imposed" on Senator Hill.

It is traditional in Parliament for the ranks of any
Government to try to laugh-off any particularly difficult
accusations, with loud jeers, much shaking of heads and
mock bravado. This is particularly so if they have advance
warning that trouble is looming.

It was quite clear from the live television coverage on the
day that the Government had no advance warning of our
story - or the fact that it was to be raised in Question
Time.

When the matter was raised the entire Government team
in the Senate sat in stunned and squirming silence. Even
the Minister for Education, Senator Amanda Vanstone,
who regularly keeps up a running commentary throughout
Question Time, sat mute and stoney-faced. The Minister
for Communications, Senator Richard Alston, initially
looked startled by the questions, then cracked a nervous
smile and then turned and gave a very public wink (he
was centre screen at the precise moment) to some unseen
colleague.

Unusually for such a circumstance, the Government issued
no statement of denial or 'clarification' to try to defuse the
serious charges in our story and not one word of denial
has been uttered in subsequent relevant Senate debates
(Telstra {Dilution of Public Ownership} Bill/Natural
Heritage Trust Bill).

Despite its public silence, the Government's ranks were in
uproar behind the scenes because of a witch-hunt trying
to track-down the source of the story. Some innocent
people were wrongly accused of having committed the
'crime' of telling the public the truth about the
Government's phoney promotion of the Trust as a means
of attempting to sell-off Telstra.

Scitech has no dispute with the need for a major national
effort to rectify our national environmental problems.
What we attack is the Government's pretence that the
proposed Trust - with only $1 billion in funding over five
years - can substantially improve existing problems. We
also refuse to accept that the funding of the environmental
program can ONLY come from the sale of Telstra.

Does this mean that once Telstra has been fully sold-off
(Senator Alston has already exposed that objective) the
national environment must go forever without further
funding?

Would it not make more sense - as has already been
widely suggested - to retain all of Telstra and allocate $1
billion every year from its massive profits towards the
same national objective? This would result in five times
the Government's planned level of expenditure while
enabling the community to retain a degree of control over
the fast-changing world of IT&T in Australia.

Why not seek a range of other proposals for funding a
meaningful attack on the environment problems which
Senator Hill has publicly admitted are costing the nation a
minimum of $1.5 billion a year - or seven times the rate of
the proposed Trust spending?

The Government's real intention - to find some political
means to try to confuse or frighten the public into
accepting the sale of Telstra - is clearly exposed by its cuts
to environment spending in the Budget.

And anybody who still doubts what the Coalition is up to
should consider its flat refusal to consider any other
means of funding national environmental rectification.
They might also look at its overall record rather than its
claims of environmental concern.

The Coalition's gross deception over the Natural Heritage
Trust is a disgrace, as confirmed by the shameful and
ashamed silence of its Senators when our story was raised
in the Parliament.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM BOASTS OF 16.4 MILLION CABLE TV SUBSCRIBERS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Deutsche Telekom announced on October 21 that 16.4 million homes were
connected to its cable television network as of September 30. The leading
cable operator in Germany, Deutsche Telekom has gained 571,000 new
customers since the beginning of the year. The number of cable ready
households has also increased since January, to 24.7 million in Germany as
a whole (compared to 24.2 million at the beginning of the year). As of
late September, 66.1% of German households were ready for connection to
the cable network, compared to 64,7% in early 1996. Of this proportion,
66.3% were actually subscribing, according to Deutsche Telekom. At the
current rate, 95% of the telecommunications network will be digitized by
the end of the year, the company further noted.

MOBISTAR RECORDS 20,000 SUBSCRIBERS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Mobistar, a Belgian company, in which France Telecom has the controlling
stake, now has a total of 20,000 subscribers six weeks after its launch
date. This news was announced by the company management on October 22,
during the official opening of this, the second Belgian mobile telephone
network. In the month of September alone, the company had a list of 10,000
subscribers and the advertising campaign had not even got underway, says
Bernard Ghillebaert, who is hoping to have 40,000 subscribers by the end
of the year. Proximus was brought into service nearly two years ago. In
order to be able to operate the network, Mobistar had to pay the Belgian
authorities a fee of FEB 9 billion (FF1.5 billion or USD300 million). The
network installation costs are put at FEB 6 billion (FF one million or
USD200 million). Mobistar is one of the few foreign companies in which
France Telecom has a share of more than 50%. We generally get established
with a local partner by taking a stake in the region of 30%, said France
Telecom's Chairman, Michel Bon, who attended Mobistar's opening ceremony
in Brussels. France Telecom's consolidated turnover in the foreign mobile
telephone sector is put at FF 700 million. The trading figures amount to
1.4 billion if minority shares are taken into account. The French business
is hoping to double its sales in this sector in 1997. When Mobistar was
launched, last August 27, its rates were 35% cheaper than Proximus's.
Three days after, the Belgian operator announced a sizeable cut in rates
to be able to compete with the newcomer. France Telecom has a 57% stake in
Mobistar, Telinfo of Belgium 10% and a group of Belgian investors 33%.
Mobistar covers 95% of the Belgian population and 58% of the Belgian
territory.

EUTELSAT OPEN NEW HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The new headquarters of the European satellite telecommunications
organisation, EUTELSAT, was officially opened on October 22, in Paris by
Jean Grenier, its Managing Director. The opening ceremony was attended by
Francois Fillon, the French Minister for Postal Services,
Telecommunications and Space. Ever since the organisation was created, in
1977, its headquarters have comprised four floors in the Tour
Montparnasse. It is now moving to a brand new building (9,000 square
meres,) built on 2,200 m2 of land (belonging to the City of Paris) on the
edge of the Andre-Citroen park. Nearly 300 people of 18 different
nationalities are now employed there to help in the task of running
EUTELSAT's fleet. Come November 13 the organisation will be launching the
Hot Bird-2 satellite, which is set to come into service in early December.
It will be positioned 13 degrees longitude east, alongside Hot Bird-1 and
EUTELSAT-II-F1. Mr Grenier says TV programmes (accounting for 70% of
EUTELSAT's turnover) transmitted by the organisation's satellites may
currently be received (by aerial or cable) by a bit more than 60 million
households in Europe (500,000 in France). Minister Fillon hailed the
success of EUTELSAT, which is now handling more than 160 channels,
including 40 digital ones. In reference to the requirement for all EU
Member States to open up their telecommunications industries by January 1,
1998, he said he could not but hail EUTELSAT's strategic options and its
aspiration to provide satellite coverage that far transcends the borders
of its member countries so as to be able to operate on a global scale in
due course.

ITALY TO PRIVATISE STET IN FEBRUARY/MARCH

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

STET, Italy's Government-owned telecommunications group is set to be
privatised as planned in February/March 1997, European Commissioner Karel
van Miert for Competition announced on October 4, on the sidelines of a
competition and antitrust conference staged in Rome. If Italy loses the
opportunity to privatise STETwithin the prescribed period, between
February and March next year, it might have to wait until the end of 1997
for an other suitable period, according to the Commissioner. Brussels is
said to be awaiting a signal from the Italian Government about the
privatisation programme. The Commissioner also came out in favour of a
six-month extension to the agreement between the Government-owned group
IRI (one of STET's shareholders) and the European Commission, rather than
the one year period sought by the Italian authorities. Under the terms of
the agreement, IRI has to cut its debt to L 4,500-5,000 billion (roughly
USD2.9 to 3.3 billion) by the end of 1996. IRI has been unable to stick to
the undertaking owing to the hold up with the privatisation drive. The
Commissioner also spoke about the Commission decision to open an inquiry
into the funding of L 1,500 billion being earmarked for the IRI in 1997 to
compensate for the group's financing activities for the Alitalia airline.
We have to examine this operation to see if state aid is involved, said
the Commissioner.

PHILIPS AND FLAT SCREENS ALLIANCE

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The Dutch electronics giant, Philips, is planning to join forces with the
Japanese group Hosiden from Osaka (central Japan) in the flat screens
sector using AMLCD liquid crystals technology. Philips has declined to
reveal the amount of money being invested into this future joint venture
in which both groups will have an equal stake. The cooperation will also
involve technoloogical exchange contracts and agreements for the sales of
goods using the AMLCD technology. Philips sees the cooperation with the
Japanese group as an opportunity to take advantage of Hosiden's leading
position in this field and to allow the Dutch group easier access to the
Japanese equipment industry. Philips has a flat screens technology
facility in Eindhoven, in the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dutch
group is unable to say yet how the deal with Hosiden will affect the 580
jobs at the Eindhoven plant. Worth USD4.6 billion in 1995, the AMLCD flat
screens market is set to almost triple by the year 2001, according to
Philips. AMLCD technology may be used for the manufacture of portable
computers, miniature TV sets and car navigation systems.

Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM), the Italian public mobile telephone company,
has announced that it has 4.9 million subscribers. This figure includes
subscribers to the TACS analog system as well as to the European standard
GSM system. TIM claims to have 1.1 million subscribers to its GSM
services, or 70% of Italian subscribers to this standard. The company
reached a point of equilibrium in the GSM sector in June, TIM's Managing
Director, Massimo Sarmi, said.

UNILOG'S NET PROFITS DOWN 11.42% IN FIRST HALF 1996

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Unilog, a consulting and computer engineering firm, announced on October
22 that its net consolidated profits were 11.42% lower for the first half
of 1996, at 12.4 million French Francs, than the 14 million Francs
recorded a year earlier. Total after tax turnover rose by 3.74% during the
same period, to 378.458 million FF, compared to 364.819 in 1995. For 1996,
consolidated turnover is expected to increase by about 10% due to a new
60/40 distribution of turnover between Paris and the other French regions,
where Unilog has expanded. The group undertook two operations involving
external expansion: the takeover of two agencies of the Easys Informatique
company (part of the Sinorg group) focusing on the industrial and banking
sectors (turnover of 20 million FF) and seven computer engineering
agencies of Alcatel TITN Answare (with 138 million FF in turnover). Unilog
has also acquired new capabilities in the areas of industrial
computerization and telecommunications, thereby preparing for the
transition to the Euro and the 21st century, the group said in a statement.

MANNESMANN MOBILFUNK CHEAPER THAN DEUTSCHE TELEKOM

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Mannesmann Mobilfunk, which operates D2, the second largest digital mobile
telephone network in Germany, announced on October 15 plans to cut its
rates at the end of October to below those of its public competitor,
Deutsche Telekom's D1. Less than ten days after Deutsche Telekom promised
a new lower rate to take effect on November 4, Mannesmann Mobilfunk
counterattacked, indicating that it would establish two new rates that
would be lower than its current rates, but only to customers who
subscribed for at least 24 months. The basic subscription (D2Fun 24) costs
24.95 DM, compared to 29 DM for Deutsche Telekom's Telly D1 Eco service.
The old version of D2 Fun 24 cost 49.90 DM. The cost of a new subscription
for private customers is "equivalent to that of a subscription to
conventional non mobile services", Mannesmann Mobilfunk emphasised. For
commercial customers (whose service is known as D2 Classic 24), the price
per minute for calls between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. will fall below the
psychological threshold of one DM to 0.99 DM, from the current 1.29 DM,
the group's statement said. Service on the D1 network costs 1,14 DM per
minute between these times. Mannesmann is also more flexible concerning
eligibility for the new low rates than Deutsche Telekom, which required
the subscriber to have been signed up for at least a year.

"Mannesmann Mobilfunk will propose the lower rates to its customers after
they have subscribed for three months", said the statement. There will be
a lump sum charge of 99 or 199 DM. Customers using D2 for more than two
years may switch at no cost. Mannesmann Mobilfunk is controlled by the
Mannesmann industrial group (65,2%) and AirTouch of the United States.
With more than 2.2 million subscribers in October, D2 leads the German
market, ahead of D1 (with two million customers). Germany has two other
mobile telephone networks, C Tel from Deutsche Telekom, a pioneering
network now losing momentum due to outdated analogue technology and E
Plus, which is growing slowly because it does not yet serve all of
Germany. A fourth network is scheduled to begin operating in May 1997. The
VIAG group (active in energy and packaging), which wants to diversify into
telecommunications, and British Telecom have both applied to operate this
network. The German Government will announce its choice in early February
1997.

LAST LAP FOR DEUTSCHE TELEKOM PRIVATISATION SCHEME

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The biggest privatisation drive in Germany's history entered its final
phase, on October 4, with the notification that 20% of the shares in the
telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom were on offer to the public.
Anxious to make a success of its stock exchange flotation, the group is
planning to pay out DM 1.5 billion in dividends in 1996 and 3 billion in
1997. Although they will be on sale in November, the shares will be
entitled to a payment in full for the year 1996. "This is the first time a
company entering the stock exchange has forecast the dividend for two
financial years, according to Joachim Kroeske, the group's Financial
Manager.

Deutsche Telekom is planning to place on the stock market up to 500
million new shares with a nominal value of DM 5. In the event of
oversubscription, there would also be an option for 75 million shares at
DM 5 each. A further 30 million shares have been earmarked for employees.
The share dividend should therefore amount to roughly DM 0.60 in 1996 and
1.20 in 1997. The price bracket was to be announced on October 22. The
bookbuilding system of sales involves a kind of auction with a fixed range
so as to favour the best offers. Deutsche Telekom is hoping to raise
roughly DM 15 billion with this partial privatisation, which leads
financial analysts to predict a price of between DM 25 and 30 per share.

The publicly offered shares subscription programme, one of the world's
biggest ever, is set to end on November 14. The price will be set on
November 16 in the light of the demands. On the morrow, Deutsche Telekom
shares will be quoted on stock exchanges in Germany as well as on Wall
Street and the New York Stock Exchange. A quotation is also on the cards
in Tokyo, London, Toronto and Quebec. In spite of its important
partnership with France Telecom, the German giant has not sought a
quotation on Paris exchange.

As well as attracting foreign investors, Deutsche Telekom is also keen on
appealing to small savers in Germany. This will be a new departure in
Germany, where there no more than 4.5 million shareholders in a country
with 81 million inhabitants. In order to attract German investors, the
group has persuaded the banks to ensure concessional commissions for small
savers. A loyalty bonus is being offered in the form of one free share for
every 10 held by small shareholders who keep their securities for three
years. All the major Germany banks are involved in the investment
consortium After the publicly offered shares subscription, the State will
still own roughly 80% of the capital base, which it plans to sell of in
stages between now and 1999.

BIGGER BT INPUT IN ALLIANCE WITH VIAG

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

In its bid to make a breakthrough in the telecommunications sector, VIAG,
the German energy and packaging group, is going to be able to count on a
stronger commitment from its UK partner, British Telecom (BT). In an
interview on October 15 with the Germany stock exchange daily, the
Boersen-Zeitung, the Chairman of the VIAG Management Board, Georg
Obermeier, said that under the terms of the two-sided plan, BT is going to
commit itself more to the operating side of the exercise. BT is set to
play a pivotal role with its technological expertise in telephone
switchboards. This specialist knowledge is going to be the cornerstone of
VIAG's plan for the German telecommunications market, which is to be fully
deregulated early in 1998. VIAG is banking on of parts of the terrestrial
network being linked with mobile telephone frequencies so as to allow, for
example, just one telephone number to be used.

VIAG has no experience at all of this sector so will be mainly in charge
of the marketing aspects of the plan. This is a new departure for our
group, as it has so far kept out of consumer goods activities. Marketing
will play a key role in this context, stressed Mr Obermeier. Last week the
latter has to resign himself to seeing the planned alliance with BT and
the Essen energy group, RWE, come to nought. According to the German
newspaper, the VIAG official kept on hoping right to the very last minute
that RWE would stick with the cooperation plan, in spite of running into a
rough patch in the talks opened last February on the basis of a letter of
intention. Because of RWE, certain options have not been taken up,
lamented Mr Obermeier. He claims that VIAG and BT would be taking step
between now and the New Year to determine the exact form their cooperation
would take so as to complement the activities of their joint offshoot in
Germany, VIAG Interkom. A key component of the BT/VIAG strategy is
obtaining a licence to run the fourth digital mobile telephone network in
Germany. Mr Obermeier is convinced the Government will pick the BT/VIAG
consortium in early 1997.

Mr Obermeier was one of those who predicted that the mobile telephone
industry bid fair to take off in a big way, but he admits the golden age
is over. We will need more than trading figures to earn money, he told the
newspaper. He thinks that the three digital networks already in place are
likely to run into capacity problems, though, thus leaving plenty of space
for his network.

ALCATEL/ALSTHOM: FF400 MILLION SHORTFALL

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

Alcatel/Alsthom logged a net loss of FF 400 million in the first half of
1996. This compares with 1.2 billion in the same period last year,
according to Serge Tchuruk the group's Chairman. Apparently, these results
are perfectly in tune with the market programme, reflecting recent trends
and the still limited effects of the recovery plan embarked upon. The
improvement in the group's situation is attributed in the main to a
reduction in taxes and the better results achieved by companies under the
equity method. The group claims the recovery programme's even bigger
impact in the second half of the year points to a return to a balanced
situation for the whole of 1996. The group's turnover stands at FF 74.3
billion, down 3.4% on first half of 1995. Orders are nonetheless on the
wax in all sectors, reaching FF 81.5 billion in the first six months with
particularly strong growth in the telecommunications division.
Alcatel/Alsthom says half of the FF 10 billion assets transfer programme
has been achieved and the programme is due to be finalised in the coming
months, thus helping to make a substantial cut in the debt ratio. The aim
of achieving 7 billion worth of savings across the board by 1998 is still
in view. More than 20,0000 job cuts have been made or announced since the
middle of last year.

MINOR REVOLUTION IN FRENCH TELEPHONE INDUSTRY

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The French telephone system has undergone a minor revolution: the
10-figure numbering system became a reality on October 18, 11 pm local
time, pending the major revolution, early in 1998, when the national
network is due to be opened up to competition from private operators. The
change affects the 32.5 million telephone subscribers who have been using
eight-figure numbers since 1985. The new system has been introduced to
enable the national network to cope with the veritable explosion in
services (fax, stationary and mobile telephones, for example) for which a
million new numbers will have to be created each year. The eight-figure
system allows for 60 million different combinations but the 10-figure
numbers have the potential to create 470 million, and thus cater for the
anticipated needs between now and the year 2050. In the countdown to
Euro-wide deregulation in 1998, France Telecom is joining forces with
American Sprint and Deutsche Telekom of Germany to create Global One, an
entity offering telephone services to businesses. It is hoped Global One
will help FT fend off some of the competition from other
telecommunications giants when national barriers come tumbling down in
Europe. The main rivals are expected to be the UK's BT, which has signed
an agreement with the French group Cegetel, whilst the Bouyges group, a
newcomer on the telephone scene, has formed a partnership with STET of
Italy.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: PROGRESS ON CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The member countries of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development) have recently made progress towards the establishment of
international guidelines for policy on cryptography, i.e., the encoding of
computerised data. Drafting of the text is expected to be completed by the
end of the year. These guideliens could then be adopted by governments and
applied by enterprises, private citizens and law enforcement authorities
to ensure protection of transactions, communications and electronic
information storage.

The OECD guidelines define issues that countries must address when
developing cryptography policy at national and international level. Tehy
could play an important role in the development of the global information
infrastructure (GII) and the global information society (GIS). National
policies must be harmonised at international level to meet the needs of
global technologies and applications. Discussions have focused on users'
rights to choose methods of encryption, the freedom of the market to
develop these methods, interoperability, the consequences for protection
of privacy and personal information, freedom of access to encoded
information and the reduction of obstacles to international trade.

Non binding recommendations

The OECD guidelines will take the form of non binding recommendations to
the government of its member countries. In other words, they will not be
incorporated into international law and will not endorse any particular
encryption system. At a recent meeting, more than 100 representatives of
OECD member countries participated in debates chaired by Norman Reaburn of
the Australian Department of Justice. Officials from Ministries of Trade,
Industry and Foreign Affairs, Commissioners responsible for data
protection and other officials involved with safeguarding privacy attended
the meeting, along with representatives of law enforcement and public
safety bodies. Representatives of the private sector from many countries
were also present. The BIAC (the OECD's Business and Industry Advisory
Committee) was involved with the entire process of drafting the guidelines
and experts on protection of privacy and personal data, as well as
consumers, were also asked to contribute to the discussions.

Work on the guidelines began in March, when the OECD set up an ad hoc
group of experts composed of representatives of governments and OECD
country experts. This group met in Washington in May and again in Paris in
June. Its third meeting took place on September 26 and 27 in Paris. The
group will continue its negotiations during the week of December 16, with
the goal of completing, by the end of the year, draft guidelines to be
submitted to the OECD Council for its approval in early 1997.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: FORUM ON FUTURE OF MOBILE SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The functioning of pocket satellite telephones into the 21st century was
the central topic of a Forum held in Geneva between October 21 and 23, and
attended by a thousand delegates from 126 countries and 250 company
representatives. Staged by the International Telecommunications Union
(ITU), the Forum on "Global mobile personal communications by satellite"
(GMPCS), was intended to goad both governments and industry to draw up
unique and globally compatible standards for this new telecommunications
technology.

This new technology extends not only to telephones but also to computers,
faxes and all mobile terminals used to communicate. It will be mainly
based on rings of satellites in low and medium orbit. Such satellites
appear to move in relation to the earth, unlike geo-stationary satellites
in high orbit which, seen from the ground, appear motionless.

Opening the Forum, ITU Secretary General Pekka Tarjanne, author of a
report used as a basis for the discussions, emphasised the "historic"
nature of the gathering. His report highlighted the Forum's "primary task"
in "defining a set of non-binding principles" which will necessarily be a
compromise. These principles will, according to Mr Tarjanne, need to
respect the "sovereign right of States to regulate telecommunications in
the framework of national policies". However, they will also need to take
account of "demands form systems operators and suppliers of GMPCS services
for open, fair and competitive access to national markets, through
transparent and non-discriminatory regulations".

Meanwhile, fourteen companies representing the industries involved in the
sector, have submitted a joint document to the World Trade Organisation
(WTO), declaring their support for "a comprehensive global agreement on
access to the satellite services market". These operators claim that a
single geo-stationary satellite costing several hundreds of millions of
dollars can replace five billion dollars-worth of terrestrial
infrastructure (cable, fibre optics etc.). While it would take more than a
century to extend terrestrial infrastructures across the entire globe,
they claim that satellites offer a cheap and rapid means of extending
telecommunications to isolated and poor regions.

Given that each individual nation will have to approve the proposed
services, satellite operators insist "the multilateral approach of the WTO
is the best alternative". They add that it is vital to "harmonise national
frequency allocations with those of other countries". For satellites to be
used worldwide, they must be accessible on the same range of frequencies
in all the countries they serve". The joint document was signed by Comsat,
Final Analysis, Globalstar, Hughes, ICO Global, Inmarsat, Iridium,
Lockheed Martin, MCHI, Motorola, Orion, PanAmSat, Teledesic and TRW.

ITU DEBATE ON "CALL BACK" SERVICES

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Geneva, has urged its
members to deliberate among themselves on one of the most controversial
issues currently facing telecommunications: "call-back" services. These
services send international calls via private operators abroad, most
commonly in the United States where prices are among the cheapest in the
world. Anxious that such services shouldn't be sold to countries where
they are banned, the ITU Council insisted on October 11 that "countries
must respect each another's national statutes". The ITU will re-examine
requests for a total ban on such practices in 1997.

The system substantially reduces the cost of calls for subscribers, but
purloins revenue from national telephone companies. "Call back" services
are expanding rapidly and currently represent a turnover of 500 million
dollars a year. The ITU believes this figure will top USD1.2 billion by
1998. Some 25 countries have thus far banned such services, according to
the ITU. In these countries, telephone companies, which are for the most
part monopolies, believe their interests are being harmed by this
opportunistic activity which continues oblivious to the cost burden of
maintaining the public telephone network. In the United States, where
tariffs are particularly low, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
authorises call-back services, although American operators are prohibited
from offering them in countries where regulations don't mirror the US
model.

Japanese companies specialising in international telecommunications
recently called for call-back services to be banned on the grounds of
unfair competition.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: MANOEUVRING IN EUROPE AS JANUARY 1 1998 DEADLINE
APPROACHES

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

European countries are preparing for the opening to competition of the EU
telecommunications market from January 1 1998, by gradually privatising
public operators, striking international alliances and deregulating mobile
telephony markets. Several countries have secured or requested extensions
to the deadline set down in Community Directives (notably Portugal and
Ireland), while others (Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have
already installed almost entirely deregulated markets.

In Germany, Deutsche Telekom is to float 20% of company capital on the
stock market in mid-November, with the remainder sold-off in stages up to
1999. The deregulation of the German market, the largest in Europe, has
sharpened the appetite of the country's leading industrial groups: RWE
(energy) and Veba (energy) have joined forces with the British company
Cable and Wireless, while Viag (energy, packaging) has struck an alliance
with British Telecom (BT). Mannesmann has secured access to the German
railways' terrestrial telecommunications network. Digital mobile telephony
is being fought over by Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann MobilFunk, with a
third licence due to granted at the beginning of 1997: Viag and BT have
submitted a joint application.

In France, the autumn has proven fertile, with two new telecommunications
poles launched: the first, Cegetel, has been constituted by the Generale
des Eaux -allied with British Telecom, Mannesmann and the American company
SBC-, the second unites the Bouygues group with the Italian operator STET.
Bouygues and the Generale des Eaux already have a stake in the
telecommunications sector through their mobile networks which compete with
France Telecom. The public operator is to start down the road to
privatisation in the spring, with the sale of a first 20% share of company
capital.

The United Kingdom is among the group of trail blazing countries. BT was
privatised in 1984, and the traditional fixed telephony market has been
gradually deregulated since 1989. The two leading operators are BT and
Mercury (Cable and Wireless), although BT remains dominant with 80% of the
market, compared with 10% for its challenger. BT recently lowered prices
by 25%, complying with the recommendations of the industry regulator
OFTEL, which continues to frame prices.

In Belgium, the public operator Belgacom was partially privatised in
December, with an international consortium led by the Americans Ameritech,
(along with Singapore Telecom and Tele Denmark) acquiring a 49.9% stake in
the company. Belgacom is not at present quoted on the stock market, but
this eventuality hasn't been ruled out. While Belgacom retains its
monopoly over fixed telephony, the mobile market was opened to competition
in this summer: Belgacom Mobile now has a competitor in Mobistar, launched
by France Telecom and the Belgian company Telinfo.

In the Netherlands, telecommunications have been privatised for a year in
the form of KPN, a holding in which the State has a 48% stake, the
remainder being traded on the stock market. The competing private
operators are mainly American owned. Consumers have a free choice of
operator, but KPN currently remains the most competitive on local calls
and communications with neighbouring countries.

In Spain, Telefonica remains a semi-public group (20% in State hands, the
remainder in public hands), with a hard core of shareholders made up of
banks and savings banks. The conservative Government has scheduled total
privatisation for 1997. Telefonica retains a monopoly on the fixed network
but has lost its dominance over mobile communications with the arrival of
the Airtel consortium, a partnership of the Americans Air Touch, Spanish
savings banks and banks, and BT with 5%. Telefonica hasn't struck any
alliances with other European groups and is focusing development
activities on Latin America.

In Portugal, the State share in Portugal Telecom has been reduced to 51%,
following two stages of privatisation. A date for the third and final
phase, covering the introduction of a strategic partner, has still to be
fixed. Telefonica in known to have expressed in its neighbour, while
France Telecom is "following the dossier".

CALL FOR PROPOSALS IN CONTEXT OF INFO 2000 PROGRAMME

from TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120

The European Commission has renewed its call for proposals for the
implementation of one of the lines of action of the Community "INFO 2000"
programme: it concerns the transfer of intellectual property rights in the
multimedia sector (line 3.2). A multi-annual programme, INFO 2000 is
intended to promote the development of a European multimedia content
industry. One aspect covered by this programme is the negotiation of
intellectual property rights. The administration of these rights is
traditionally organised by sector (text, sound, images, video, etc.). The
time and effort employed in the identification and acquisition of rights
is rising sharply as the number of forms of data, and of countries in
which right-holders reside increase. In this context, and on the eve of
the multimedia era, efficient and cost-effective mechanisms for
negotiating multimedia rights have become indispensable.

The call for proposals covers the selection of experts who will provide
technical support in this field to the European Commission services in
Luxembourg. The deadline for submissions is December 2 1996.

Further details on this call can be obtained before November 20 from DG
XIII-E-1, fax (352)43 013 79. Contact: J.Hoorens, DG XIII-E-2, tel.
(352)43 013 25 60, fax (352)43 013 31 90.

VISITS TO THE NIPPON STEEL RESEARCH LABORATORIES IN
JAPAN

Summarizes (June 1994) visits to two of Nippon's Steels
premier research laboratories: Steel Research; and
Advance Materials and Technology Research.  The main
focus of the visits involved titanium,
titanium-aluminide, and carbon-based materials
development at Nippon Steel, all areas in which Nippon
Steel is trying to develop new products and markets.
In particular, Nippon Steel has been somewhat
successful in marketing Ti as a structural and
functional material in new non-aerospace markets such
as construction and consumer goods.  They have also
placed emphasis on the automotive markets, but so far
have met only limited success.  Their penetration into
the high performance aerospace Ti alloys markets has
been very limited.  R&D efforts in new self-lubricating
materials and functionally gradient materials
technologies are also reviewed.

KOREA'S CENTER FOR ADVANCED AEROSPACE MATERIALS

Summarizes (June 1994) discussions held with members of
Korea's newly organized Center for Advanced Aerospace
Materials, which is supported by the Korea Science and
Engineering Foundation.  Although the majority of
projects fall under the broad category of aerospace
materials, some work is also aimed at the application
of traditional aerospace materials to automotive and
other applications.  The largest effort is based on Al
alloys, such as the 7000 series, Al-Li alloys, and  Rs-
Al alloys.  Of note is a high-strength and weldable Mn-
modified Al-Zn-Mg alloy that is being developed for
commercialization.  Other work includes elemental
PM-based gamma Ti-Al alloys, AIN fibers, whiskers and
foams produced by SHS, and theoretical advancements in
SPF.

Summarizes a (May 1994) visit to NKK's Materials and
Processing Research Center (Kawasaki, Japan in May
1994), in order to discuss their activities in the R&D
of advanced materials.  Emphasis is placed on three
general areas: (1) SP-700, a promising new
superplastically formable Ti alloy having an attractive
balance of properties and formability; (2) a new
titanium aluminide alloy for aerospace and automotive
applications, having a dramatically improved balance of
room temperature strength and ductility, and
process/product development efforts for automotive
applications; and (3) process development and
production of a magnetic steel sheet alloy with 6.5%
Si, which is a dramatic increase in Si over
conventional Si sheet alloys, which leads to improved
electromagnetic properties.  The high Si sheet steel is
produced on a commercial scale using a novel CVD
reaction and diffusion process.

JAPANESE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE STRENGTH OF
MATERIALS

This conference
(in Sendai, Japan, Aug. 21-26, 1994) provided an
excellent snapshot of the current understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms of the deformation and failure
of crystalline materials.  One of the more provocative
papers was presented by Prof. Vitek concerning a model
linking brittle intergranular fracture caused by the
structure of segregated grain boundaries in alloys, and
the grain boundary structures in intermetallics.
Several interesting papers of an empirical nature were
also presented, including: reviews of nano-laminated
materials; high-strength, ductility, and stiffness
quasicrystalline Al-based alloys; and a comprehensive
review of superplastically formable fine-grained
ceramics.

VISIT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING AT
THE TOKYO INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

The visitor was given a brief overview (in Sep. 1994)
by Prof. Matsuo.  Following that overview, the visitor
gave a brief seminar on microstructure/property
relationships in gamma TiAl alloys to several members
of the faculty and a handful of graduate students.
Discussions were held with Prof. Takeyama on phase
stability and transformations of several intermetallic
alloy systems, including gamma TiAI.  Since coming to
TIT, Prof. Takeyama has broadened his research to
include microstructure/property effects, with emphasis
on the fixed effect of static heat treatments on
microstructure and properties, while continuing his
research on the effect of ternary additions to the
phase stability of near-gamma alloys.  The majority of
the phase stability work on Ti-A-X systems has been
where X is Cr, Nb, V or Mo.  Of potential commercial
significance is Prof. Takeyama's work on air cooling
and rapid quenching from the single phase alpha region,
followed by tempering or aging.  He has demonstrated
that it is possible to use quench and tempering
treatments to refine the as-cast structure, thus
improving the room temperature strength and ductility
over typical coarse cast microstructures.

DEFENSE CONVERSION IS AN OPTION, BUT IT WILL NOT
HEAL WOUNDS OF CONTRACTION, EXECUTIVES ARGUE

        Successful diversification into new commercial markets is
possible for defense contractors, but it will never make up for
the loss of jobs and revenue stemming from nearly a decade of
defense cutbacks.
        That was the consensus among three top executives of the
defense/aerospace industry at last week's Global Air & Space 94
International Business Forum and Exhibition, in Arlington, Va.
        The executives who expressed these views were: Richard D.
Brandes, senior vice president of GM Hughes Electrics; Sam Araki,
executive vice president of Lockheed Missiles & Space Co.; and
Peter Teets, president of the space group for Martin Marietta
Corp.
        Successful defense conversion on any scale requires time,
patience and a federal government that understands the challenges
defense firms face as the industry continues to contract, they
said.
        "Our entry into commercial markets did not happen
overnight," said Brandes. "It has taken about thirty years to
establish our position in what was unchartered territory for us."
        Hughes Electronics' voyage into the commercial marketplace
began shortly after the defense electronics firm launched its
first geosynchronous satellite for the U.S. government in 1963.
Shortly thereafter, Hughes entered the commercial satellite
business, which today brings in about $2 billion each year for
the company.
        At last week's defense business forum, Hughes made no secret
of its interest in commercial markets with a massive tele-visual
exhibit of its projects in satellite-based communications markets
such as DirecTV, which will offer hundreds of channel options for
homeviewers.
        "Some of these markets could develop into larger businesses,
but there is no way to make up for the losses we continue to face
in [defense-related] downsizing," said Brandes.
        He added that successful conversion cannot happen within the
confines of existing defense industry structures. While many
commercial technologies may have spun out of defense-related
applications, Brandes says it is critically important to create
new business structures within parent firms that focus solely on
commercial markets.
        Lockheed's Araki agreed with Brandes. Though Lockheed has
aggressively entered the commercial space markets of remote
sensing and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology, so far it
has fallen far short of making up for its 50 percent decrease in
size over the past decade.
        Araki said that space/defense contractors must do a better
job of marketing their technologies and making sure that space-
based technologies get the same attention that defense spin-offs
have. "The Clinton administration has not treated space with as
much advocacy as it has other technology industries," he
contends.
        "If we [as a country] do not address these issues, the space
industry will never again be as dominant in the global
marketplace as it was during the Cold War."

NORTHERN TELECOM TO TRANSFER $330M WORTH OF WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY

        Moving aggressively into a market that could reach $3
billion by 1996. Northern Telecom Ltd. (NT) last week announced a
$330 million agreement to provide digital wireless telephone
services in Mexico.
        According to Frank McNally, Washington, D.C.-based spokesman
for NT, this marks the largest technology transfer ever for the
company's wireless business.
        David Twyver, president of NT's wireless systems group, said
sales from his division could shoot up to $1 billion next year as
the company takes advantage of the growing market for wireless
telephone services in developing countries and the demand for
cheaper mobile phone service in the U.S.
        In just the last two months, NT has signed wireless
agreements with the countries of Uzbekistan, Columbia, and
Finland. The Toronto-based telecom firm is currently negotiating
an agreement with Ionica of the United Kingdom.
        With few telephone lines in many developing countries,
digital wireless access technology offers an inexpensive way to
get telephone service to remote areas. According to Twyver,
copper lines cost around $1,200-$1,300 per subscriber and can run
as high as $2,000. For wireless access service, the cost is under
$1,000 per subscriber.

SUPER BATTERY?

        Bolder Technologies Corp., of Wheat Ridge, Colo., last week
announced it will get $100,000 from the Advanced Research
Projects Agency to develop a battery with a cell size of 30 amp
hours. The Thin Metal Technology battery could be used for
electric cars, hybrid vehicles and lawn mowers. If initial tests
are successful, Bolder hopes to gain an additional $750,000 from
ARPA to fund pilot production.

ENVIRONMENTAL TECH TRANSFER.

        The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) will open an
environmental technology center in Osaka, Japan this month to
help transfer environmentally sound technologies between East
Asian countries. According to Elizabeth Dowdsdell, agency
director, "UNEP would like to see the [center] evolve as a
proactive intermediator between sources and users of
environmentally sound technology by systematically building up the
capacity of developing countries to choose, digest and utilize
these technologies." The program will focus primarily on enviro-
management in big cities.

DON'T CLOSE, COMMERCIALIZE!

        Hoping to forestall the closure of McClellan Air Force Base,
in Sacramento, Calif., local officials last week launched a
coalition they hope will spawn a booming high-tech presence in
the region. The coalition, called the Sacramento Regional
Economic Development Alliance (REDA), is designed to foster
commercial use of some of the high-tech capabilities at McClellan
Air Force Base. Local leaders hope the Pentagon will eventually
view McClellan as too valuable to the military and business
sector to be shuttered. But Kenneth Flamm, assistant to the under
secretary of defense and a specialist in dual-use issues, warned
McClellan advocates not to count on the base being spared.

AN ODD TRADING COUPLE.

        Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, during a trade visit here
last week, urged the U.S. not to let political and social
differences between China and the U.S. stand in the way of a
fruitful economic and technological cooperation. He warned that to
discontinue China's Most Favored Nation trade status could
jeopardize that cooperation. Zou said that over the 15 years since
China and the United States established diplomatic relations,
despite ups and downs, difficulties and disputes, the overall
relations between the two countries have moved forward with
exchanges and cooperation in various fields such as information
technology.

TO BE, OR NOT TO BE ... A SUBSIDY.

        An editorial in last Wednesday's Financial Times sharply
criticized the Clinton administration's increased involvement in
U.S. industrial policy. "Old fashioned industrial intervention is
being glossed up and justified under the heading of technology
policy," the editorial said. "But the familiar shape of the pork
barrel is already discernible." The editorial asserts that the
administration is abusing the leverage it gained preserving R&D
subsidies during the recent Uruguay round of trade talks. While the
Times questions the integrity using federal money to subsidize
domestic manufacturing, as is the case with the Pentagon's recent
Flat Panel Display initiative (TTW, May 3, p.1), it also suggests
such endeavors have a history of failure.

WATKINS-JOHNSON'S TWO-PRONGED CONVERSION STRATEGY PAYING OFF

        Despite hard times in the early 1990s, Palo Alto, Calif-
based Watkins-Johnson Co., is finding success with its two
pronged strategy to drive its business away from strict
dependence on the defense market.
        The company is taking advantage of federal defense
conversion initiatives to supplement its own R&D investments in
commercial and dual-use projects, while expanding its
international operations by opening up new, larger facilities in
Asia.
     As an example of the first part of its strategy, W-J is in
the process of negotiating the specifics on a Technology
Reinvestment Project (TRP) award valued at $11 million to develop
a Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) digital base station
for the Personal Communication Services (PCS) wireless market.
     The system will incorporate such advanced technologies as
SMART antenna systems, high-performance digitizers and power
amplifiers.
     The company teamed with ArrayComm, Inc. (Santa Clara,
Calif.), and Spectrian (Mountainview, Calif.) to put up $5.5
million matched by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
The team will employ dual-use technology in the hopes of
establishing themselves in the PCS market.
        To further offset declining demand in the U.S. defense
sector, W-J has been actively expanding its overseas presence,
particularly in Korea and Japan.  According to W-J documents, the
company expanded office space and staff in Korea, and has plans
to do the same in its Japanese subsidiary during the first half
of 1994.
        This internationalization is designed to get the company
closer to the Pacific Rim's growing base of customers, says
manager of production and information, Frank E. Emery.
        Indeed, the company will market one third of its
semiconductor equipment production to foreign customers this
year. This move, industry analysts say, will contribute
significantly to the estimated 50 percent growth that this facet
of the business is expected to achieve in 1994.
        Elliot H. Rogers, analyst for New York-based Cowen & Company
says this strategy is moving the company in the right direction.
In 1991 and 1992 W-J experienced revenue contractions due to
shrinking sales in the defense industry, but has--with $286
million posted in 1993--begun to experience a sales rebound.
        However, according to Emery, success in defense conversion
has not come easily. Changes in production focus and the
company's infrastructure led to high restructuring charges and a
20 percent work force reduction in 1991. Even so, the company has
still not reached its 1990 sales high of $311 million.
        Moreover, Rogers says that if W-J is to build on its current
success, it will have to be aware of a growing base of
competitors chasing the same semiconductor equipment dollars.
        According to Rogers, W-J's main competitor is Novellus
Systems of San Jose, Calif. Novellus has increased its net sales
from 1992 to 1993 by 63 percent. Current annual sales are pegged
at $113.5 million. In the 1980s only 15 percent of W-J's sales
were commercial, while 85 percent were in defense. Today 40
percent of sales come from non-defense business.

NAVY DUAL USE PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON FIVE TECHNOLOGY AREAS

        The Department of the Navy is putting the finishing touches
on defense conversion funding of its own for FY 95. An official
announcement should be made within the next several weeks,
according to Navy spokesman Marc Whetstone.
        Similar to the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP), the
program will focus on developing and deploying dual use
technologies. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to solicit
topics in ocean platforms, ocean environment, aircraft platforms,
information systems and control, and human systems.
        Unlike the TRP, however, this program will not necessarily
require that industry partners invest 50 percent or more to a
project, according to Rear Adm. Marc Pelaez, chief of Naval
Research.
        As reported earlier (TTW, April 19, p.6), this Navy defense
technology program will be funded with about $50 million from the
Navy's science and technology budget.
        The ONR is currently in the process of creating a program
brochure which will be sent to any companies requesting
information. Whetstone says the brochure will give a detailed
description of the technology areas the Navy is interested in,
information for submitting proposals, and the necessary forms.
        For more information contact Whetstone at ONR, 703/696-5032.

GOVERNMENT ASKS INDUSTRY TO TAKE LEAD ON FSU CONVERSION, TECH
TRANSFER

        Companies such as Amoco, EG&G, MC Power, Babcock and Wilcox,
Jaycor and Merrill Lynch attended a workshop held late last month
to explore cooperative research projects with Russian and
Ukrainian research institutions, according to Mike Deegan, vice
president of Teledyne, Inc. and interim president of the U.S.
Industry Coalition (USIC).
        USIC, currently funded by the U.S. government through the
Department of Energy (DoE) at $35 million, encourages cooperative
ventures with Russian labs to engage nuclear scientists and
engineers in non-weapons-related work. But it also aims to
provide Russian institutions with U.S. firms' knowledge of
project management, market research and other aspects of business
development and management.
        By gathering together experts from DoE laboratories,
industry, and universities with some background in Ukrainian
affairs, the group hopes to provide a network of contacts to
match potential U.S. contracts with FSU partners. While the U.S.
partners will fund their own R&D and provide business training to
the labs, USIC's $35 million will fund the FSU research effort.
        But "this is not just a give-away program," Deegan said.
"[U.S. partners] will get a marketable product that can be sold
in Russia, the U.S. or both."
        Another incentive for U.S. firms to do business with FSU
labs is that costs for research are far lower than those in the
U.S. The projects will probably cost under $1 million each,
Deegan said.
        "The objective is to spread the wealth, and we can better do
that by funding 40 projects rather than 12," he said.
        The program is good for both U.S. industry as well as
Ukraine, Nadia McConnell, president of the non-profit U.S.-
Ukraine Foundation points out.
        In addition to providing a "springboard" to transfer
military work done in Ukrainian labs to industrial base
development, "it allows U.S. industry to plug into DoE labs," she
said, adding that the project will also boost the presence of
U.S. firms in Ukraine and Russia.

 ...Program Looking for Quick Turn Around

        "We want to get technologies that can be produced and
commercialized in 16-18 months," Deegan said, adding, "We are
targeted to a range of firms," not just small or large, with a
range of technology development interests.
        If a U.S. firm is interested in developing a new product in
conjunction with a Ukrainian institute, USIC says it can provide
the firm with the appropriate contacts in Ukrainian labs. Once
the cooperative project had been negotiated, they would sign a
Project Letter Agreement.
        "The only financial risk is the R&D, which the U.S. firm
undertakes itself," Deegan said. The Russian partner is paid
through cash transfers from government accounts set up by USIC.
There is no funding limit on individual projects.
        There are already around 300 collaborations between Russian,
Ukrainian and DoE institutions that have been established over
the past three years under various programs, but this is the
first government-industry partnership that is a for-profit
enterprise, Deegan said.
        Electronics, communications, and biomedics offer good
potential for developing new products, Deegan said.
        Despite the poor reputation of the health care system of the
Soviet Union, there are some medical areas in which the Russians
are actually ahead of the West, he added.
        Some of the more high-tech physics and engineering projects
include a venture to create a model to determine material
strength, fracture and failure levels and an initiative to
develop system and application software for parallel computing.

NIST TO FOCUS $745M TOWARD LONG-RANGE ADVANCED TECH PROGRAMS

        Industry welcomed NIST's announcement last week that it
would focus its next round of the Advanced Technology Program on
five specific technology areas. But some are complaining that
since the funding is spread out over five years, the money
doesn't seem like all that much.
        The agency will spent $745 million over the next five years,
matched by an equal amount from industry, to develop advanced
technologies in critical areas such as DNA analysis and computer
integrated manufacturing.
        "I think it's a good idea that NIST is focusing on specific
areas," says Walt Finkelstein, president of Advanced Lithography
Group, of Columbia, Md. "This method allows companies in those
areas to have a better competitive edge in winning funding."
        However, he says that $745 million over five years does not
seem like a lot of money considering that the budget for the 1994
Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP) is nearly $650 million for
just one year.
        The program will focus on five specific areas which were
selected based on industry suggestions, and evaluated against
four criteria: potential benefit to the U.S., strength of
technical ideas, evidence of strong industry commitment, and the
opportunity for ATP funds to make a difference in moving
technology forward. The five areas are:

        *  Tools for DNA Diagnostics - A five-year, $145 million
        program to develop compact, low cost, automated DNA analysis
        technologies and equipment.
        *  Information Infrastructure for Health Care - A five-year,
        $185 million program to develop an information
        infrastructure to enable integrated medical information
        systems.
        *  Manufacturing Composite Structures - A five year, $160
        million program to reduce the high initial cost of using
        advanced composite materials for commercial applications
        such as bridges and automobiles.
        *  Component-Based Software - A five-year, $150 million
        program to develop technologies necessary to enable
        systematically re-useable software components.
        *  Computer-Integrated Manufacturing for Electronics - A
        five-year, $105 million program to develop a flexible
        software-based framework to boost manufacturing
        productivity.

        Interested companies may apply for up to $2 million over
three years. Joint ventures of two or more companies can apply
for five years worth of funding with no dollar limit. NIST will
sponsor a series of public meetings on the program. The first
will be held June 2-3, at the Holiday Inn, Gaithersburg, Md. For
more information call 1-800 ATP-FUND.
        Because full proposals can get expensive, NIST suggests that
companies first submit abbreviated proposals for funding in the
form of a white paper to allow NIST to determine if the project
has the potential to meet the needs of the program.

GERMANY:  INTERVENES WITH BANGLADESH ON CASE OF TASLIMA NASREEN

   NEW DELHI, July 31 (IPS) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
winding up a visit to India this week revealed that his country had
intervened with the Bangladesh government on behalf of fugitive
writer Taslima Nasreen.
   "Germany undertook a demarche to the Bangladesh government that
we want to look after her case so that she can move freely in her
country," Kinkel, who is also Vice Chancellor told a news
conference here in Delhi.
   But he declined to elaborate on the statement, saying, "It is
in the interest of Taslima Nasreen that we do not disclose all that
we have decided on her behalf. I hope you understand."
   Germany, which is the current president of the European Union,
last week said European foreign ministers had agreed at a meeting
in Brussels to instruct their ambassadors in Dhaka to urge the
Bangladesh government to protect the feminist writer.
   "It was at my initiative that European Union ministers discussed
her case at length and said she was welcome to all the 16 member
countries," Kinkel said here.
   Nasreen is in hiding in Bangladesh where the authorities have
issued an arrest warrant against her under pressure from Muslim
fundamentalists who want her hanged for blasphemy.
   The Bangladesh government has said that Nasreen is free to go
abroad, but must first submit herself to due process of law. The
writer, who denies the charge, is accused of recommending a
revision of the Koran in an interview to a Calcutta newspaper,
where she had stopped over on her way back from a business trip to
Europe concerning publication of her work in translation.
   What she actually told the paper, she explained, was that what
needed revision was the Sharia, the Islamic code of law, because
of its repressive legislation on women, not the Koran itself, which
is the Holy Writ of Mohammedanism.
   Kinkel, who arrived in India on July 27 on a bilateral trade and
business promotion visit, also discussed Kashmir, the reform of the
United Nations system and nuclear non-proliferation with his hosts.
   Germany supports India's case for a permanent seat on the U.N.
Security Council as much as it seeks one for itself, he said,
adding that both countries have agreed to cooperate to work for
reforming the U.N. system.
   "The U.N. Security Council does not reflect the situation in
the world as it is today," Kinkel said. As the biggest European
country and leading world economic power, Germany had "obligations
towards the international community", he added.
   On India's dispute over Kashmir with arch-adversary Pakistan,
Germany has advised both New Delhi and Islamabad to find a solution
on the basis of U.N. resolutions and the two-decade-old bilateral
Shimla accord, he said.
   The northern Indian state has been a bone of contention since
Pakistan's creation in 1947. Islamabad accuses Indian security
forces of rights abuse in battling the four-year-old Kashmir
insurgency, which New Delhi says is being aided by Pakistan.
   Rivalry in the subcontinent has stoked fears of a nuclear
confrontation. Though there is no clinching evidence, both India
and Pakistan are believed to possess the necessary expertise to
build nuclear bombs.
   Neither country has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
(NPT). India says it discriminates between the nuclear haves and
have-nots.
   Foreign Minister Kinkel said India and Germany have agreed to
discuss nuclear non-proliferation, an issue "on which India has
its own point of view".
   Bonn had raised the NPT during Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao's second official trip to Germany earlier this year.
Chancellor Kohl who visited New Delhi a year ago had urged India
to sign the NPT, but did not link this to future aid.
   Germany is India's second largest donor after Japan and has
given more than 15 billion dm since 1958, making India the largest
recipient of official development assistance (ODA).
   On July 28 Kinkel signed a financial cooperation agreement with
Finance Minister Manmoham Singh that offers 460 million D-marks for
mainly poverty alleviation and the protection of natural resources
and the environment.
   India is a major partner in Germany's current efforts to expand
economic contacts in Asia, the foreign minister said. His
delegation included 24 German business leaders.
   "The intensification of economic relations is at the center of
my visit and talks in New Delhi. We look at India as a future
mega-market and are looking for a real partnership in our economic
relations," Kinkel declared.

BANGLADESH:  ANTI-TASLIMA RALLIES IN DHAKA

   DHAKA, July 31 (IPS) -- Armed police were posted outside mosques
and in sensitive localities here in the Bangladesh capital July 29
to maintain peace during two rallies after evening prayers to press
for the hanging of feminist writer Taslima Nasreen.
   Hundreds of people streamed into Dhaka from adjoining townships
and villages for the twin rallies called separately by the
opposition Jamaat-e-Dulami and the United Action Alliance of 13
other groups.
   Nasreen has been in hiding since June 4, trying to escape a
government arrest warrant and a Muslim fatwa for blasphemy.
   The Khaleda Zia government is under growing pressure from the
West to protect the 32-year-old fugitive writer who is being
described as the female Salman Rushdie.
   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel who is visiting New Delhi
is reported saying again on July 29 on behalf of the European
Union, of which Germany is the current chairman, that Dhaka has
been told it must ensure her safety or allow her to leave the
country.
   The Bangladesh government continues to insist that the country's
laws provide ample protection for the fugitive writer, but she must
first submit herself to the due process of the law.
   The government has said that Nasreen would be allowed to leave
the country after she proves her innocence in court.
   The twin rallies follow a month of protests and meetings by
religious extremists to mobilize support countrywide for their
campaign to make Bangladesh an Islamic Republic, hang Nasreen for
blasphemy and ban non-governmental groups that they are accusing
of anti-Islamic activities.
   Dhaka was relatively quiet on July 29 as Friday is the Islamic
holiday, and all offices and some markets in the city were closed.
   Rival calls for nationwide strikes on June 30, had led to ugly
clashes between Nasreen's supporters and opponents, causing the
death of a 14-year-old in a northern village.
   Nasreen is being hounded for calling for a revision of the Koran
in an interview granted to an Indian newspaper, The Statesman. The
writer has denied the charges, saying she was misquoted.
   The government wants her arrested for "maliciously outraging
the religious feelings of Muslims", a charge the religious
extremists insist must be punished with death.

PHILIPPINES:  CATHOLIC CHURCH LAUNCHES CRUSADE AGAINST CAIRO
              U.N. CONFERENCE ON POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT

By Lian Nemenzo-Hernandez
   MANILA, July 31 (IPS) -- The Catholic Church in the Philippines
has gone on the offensive against the government's population
policy in the run-up to the big U.N. conference in Cairo next
month, but women's groups here are determined to fight back.
   Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin this week called on the
people of Asia's only Catholic nation to join a protest rally next
month to protest the government's plans to reduce population growth
rate with artificial contraceptives and legalized abortion.
   "We want to make known to the president and his cabinet our
indignation and outrage at the abuses being allowed by government
against the family and our children," Sin said.
   He said children are being bombarded with reading materials and
films containing "pornographic, perverse and poisonous sexual
propaganda" as part of their education, and are being conditioned
to adopt a "contraceptive mentality".
   "The government's population program brainwashes children to
accept as normal, attractive and even glamorous certain unnatural,
abnormal and perverse sexual relationships and behavior such as
homosexuality, lesbianism, incest, sodomy, oral sex, contraception,
sterilization and abortion," Sin added.
   Education and health officials dismissed the Cardinal's
outburst, saying he was engaging in a "baseless debate".
   It was the Church's strongest criticism yet of Manila's
population policy, and appears to be carefully coordinated with the
Vatican's broadsides against some provisions in the Cairo
documents. Last month, the Vatican reportedly sent a faxed protest
to the Philippine government criticizing its support for abortion.
   Sin attacked the Philippine stance at the International
Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in
September: "Global forces, backed by the wealth of powerful
nations, are out to destroy the family by first destroying our
children."
   The government of Fidel Ramos, the country's first Protestant
president, is promoting both natural and artificial methods of
birth control to help bring down an annual 2.5 percent birth rate.
   Anti-abortion groups say the Philippine delegation to Cairo, led
by Health Secretary Juan Flavier, is planning to support a U.S.-
backed proposal for acceptance of abortion as a birth control
method.
   But health officials say none of the government's programs
advocate abortion.
   "We have to be clear on this," said Health Under-Secretary Jaime
Galvez Tan. "We provide and teach natural and artificial methods.
But we leave the decision up to the woman herself, her reproductive
rights and her choices."
   Member of the Philippine delegate to Cairo, Marilen Danguilan
agrees: "The accusation is unfounded. We rejected abortion as a
means of contraception. In fact, we have been arguing with the U.S.
delegation not to be so fixated on abortion. The issue is bigger."
   Manila Vice Mayor Joselito Atienza, who heads the organisation
Pro-Life Philippines, said the government should "reject the draft
(ICPD) resolution and the way of life being imposed on us by
foreign nations". He said the 83-page document contains provisions
that are "contrary to Filipino culture, tradition and religion".
   Women activists say such statements reflect the "very narrow"
thinking that has placed women in a subordinate position in
society.
   "The Church's thinking with regard to women's role continues to
relegate them to the Middle Ages and denies women the right to make
decisions for themselves," says Ana Maria Nemenzo, national
coordinator of WomanHealth Philippines, a non-governmental group.
   "The Catholic Church sees 'abortion' as lurking behind every
phrase and provision in the draft ICPD document," she says.
   The Church is suspicious of terms like "safe motherhood",
fearing it could be used to smuggle in the concept of abortion. It
even opposes the World Health Organisation's (WHO) definition of
"reproductive health".
   "But the question of population and development goes far beyond
the issue of abortion," says Nemenzo. "For us women, it touches on
gender equity and women's self-determination, and the appropriate
development strategy that will guarantee these."
   Several non-governmental groups sponsored a forum here today to
discuss the draft ICPD document and its implications on the status
of women in the Philippines and the rest of the world.
   Organisers said despite lip service given to improving status
of women in the Third World, nothing will come out of these efforts
unless women's self-determination is recognized and accepted.
   Antonio de los Reyes, president of the Council of the Laity of
the Philippines, criticized the country's delegation to the Cairo
meeting, which he said includes "academic disciples of
unconditional artificial birth control and at least three open
advocates of the cause for legalization of abortion".
   "Not one Pro-Life proponent was included in the delegation," he
complained.
   Women's groups say the Vatican should not be allowed to
intervene in U.N. proceedings. The Church only has observer status
at the United Nations and should therefore not be given undue
importance and space in official U.N. sessions, they add.
   Because of persistent lobbying by the Vatican, several
provisions in the ICPD document have been "bracketed" or identified
as areas that still have to be debated in Cairo, including
reproductive rights, reproductive health, fertility regulation and
safe motherhood.
   Women activists say they will continue to push for gender equity
in all these issues in Cairo and will lobby to ensure that various
contraceptive options remain open to women.

ALGERIA:  FRENCH GROUPS SUPPORT INTELLECTUALS, THEATRE DIRECTORS
          DOCTORS AND PROFESSORS DRIVEN OUT BY ISLAMIC FANATICISM

By Barbara Borst
   PARIS, July 31 (IPS) -- With political violence in Algeria
claiming new victims daily, French organizations offer solidarity
any way they can -- aid to refugees, information campaigns, running
pressure groups and supporting democrats-in-exile.
   They don't expect help from the French government, which rejects
Algerian requests for asylum, say the groups, for fear that doing
so will trigger massive immigration to France. France, they add,
still takes a colonialist view of a country it held for 132 years.
   Hugo Colonna of the International Support Committee for Algerian
Intellectuals said his group's goals are to disseminate accurate
information about the complex political conflict and "to permit
those intellectuals to express themselves in France."
   Theatre directors, journalists, doctors and university
professors have been among targets of attacks that have taken at
least 4,000 lives in Algeria since January 1992.
   Violence erupted after the military took power in January 1992
and cancelled the second round of elections the radical Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) were poised to win. The military banned the
FIS and launched a campaign to repress fundamentalist opposition.
It claims that the Islamic militants have committed most killings.
   The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has claimed responsibility for
many attacks, including those on foreigners, but FIS says that the
security forces have slaughtered thousands of people themselves in
their bid to suppress Islamic radicalism.
   "It's not just a question of combat between Islamists and the
state," Colonna said. "In the middle there is a society. It was
one of the leading countries (in the region), rich with potential.
   "There was democracy from 1988 until 1992. They're still
struggling for that." However, there are deep antagonisms between
and within opposition movements, he noted.
   Sami Boumendjel of the Committee for Dialogue in Algeria said
that to resolve the conflict the regime must return to the
democratic process it interrupted. "No one can impose himself by
force. We must go back to the sovereignty of the people," he said.
   Boumendjel's committee seeks dialogue with all factions that
favor democracy through commitment to elections, whatever the
results, the establishment of a constitution and the rule of law,
and equal access for all men and women to work, schools and other
social benefits.
   Some charge that fundamentalists would not practice such
principles, and Bernard Dreano of the Forum of Mediterranean
Citizens, among others, warn of fundamentalists (including former
Communists) with a Stalinist devotion to centralized power.
   But Boumendjel is convinced that there are Islamic moderates who
can be an essential part of the solution. "Our strategy is to
enclose Islamists in the framework of democracy," he said.
   Dreano says the group tries to create "space for reflection and
solidarity" that sets the conflict in context. Algeria is not alone
among North African states in facing serious challenges from
Islamic fundamentalists, although its methods of combatting them
differ from those used in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt.
   "France has no policy except to reinforce the power in place in
Algeria," Dreano said. "They don't support the opposition."
   Mouloud Aounit of the Movement Against Racism (MRAP) said most
Algerian refugees, now arriving in France by the hundreds, don't
seek political asylum. "They don't want to cut ties with Algeria.
They just want to breathe a little," he said.
   Those who do seek asylum generally run afoul of the French
government's interpretation of the Geneva Convention to cover only
those persecuted by the state.
   Ordinary people caught between the government and Islamic
militants generally don't qualify, he said. France focuses on
Algeria when a foreigner is killed but pays little attention to the
murder of thousands of ordinary Algerians.
   Souad Benani of Nanas Beurs, a French group for women of North
African ancestry, said her organisation tries to inform the French
people and aid Algerians who enter France.
   "Women often demand refugee status on the basis of sexism," she
said. "They are threatened by fundamentalism. But political refugee
status is already very difficult to acquire. We fight case by
case."
   Robert Menard, president of Reporters Without Borders (RSF),
said his group pressures Algerian authorities, operates a toll-free
telephone number for information on obtaining refugee status in
France and helps immigrants find work.
   But while RSF collected substantial funds to support journalists
in the former Yugoslavia, it had less luck raising funds for
Algerian journalists, who need such things as walkie-talkies to
improve their survival chances.
   Perhaps that is because "90 percent of the press is propaganda"
in Algeria, Menard claimed. Still, he conceded, with 15 journalists
killed in two and a half years, "there's no other country where
it's more dangerous."

ALGERIA:  ARMED ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OFFERS TO END ASSASSINATION
          OF FOREIGNERS IF LEADER RELEASED FROM PRISON

By Cherif Cordahi
   CAIRO, July 31 (IRS) -- The killing of foreigners in Algeria is
likely to continue despite an offer by Islamic radicals blamed for
several murders to end their campaign if the authorities release
a senior militant member from prison.
   Local journalists and Western diplomats in the North African
state say the government is unlikely to cave in to the militant
demand that it release Abdelhak Layada, a senior figure in the
militant Armed Islamic Movement (MIA).
   Militants from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), a sister-
organisation of the MIA, demanded Layada's release after they freed
two Arab ambassadors they kidnapped a week earlier.
   Western diplomats in the capital, Algiers, told IPS this week
that the GIA had changed its mind about trading the two
ambassadors, Kassem Asker Djebrani of Yemen and Hill Bin Salem
Assiyabi of Oman, for Layada.
   "There was a lot debate within the GIA about what to do if the
government refused to cave in to their demands," said one diplomat.
"In the end they decided to release the two because they were Arabs
and good Muslims."
   Once released, the two ambassadors handed a message from the GIA
to government officials making the offer of ending their killing
of foreigners in return for Layada.
   Government officials refused to comment about the militant
demand. But in a statement the authorities said that "Algeria
reasserts its determination to follow up its efforts to protect its
hosts and visitors in accordance with the noble principles of
Islam."
   Around 4,000 people -- mainly security personnel and militants
-- have been killed in almost three years of violence since the
government canceled elections in January 1992 which the Islamic
radicals were poised to win. The MIA is linked to the now-outlawed
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which won most of the votes.
   At least 42 foreigners have been killed since the GIA warned all
foreigners to leave Algeria by December last year.
   After a lull in the spring months, the number of killings has
rocketed in recent weeks. On July 6, seven Italians died when
militants climbed aboard their boat at night and slit their throats
as they slept.
   On July 11, seven more foreigners -- four Russians, two
Yugoslavs and one Romanian -- were also killed. On July 20, a local
journalist with the national news agency, the Algerian Press
Service (APS), was gunned down in front of his home.
   One journalist with APS, who did not want to be named, told IPS
she was very scared. "We're all keeping a low profile," she said
by telephone. "We don't know who's going to be killed next."
   Diplomats say the GIA demand for the release of an MIA member
is a "serious development" for the military-backed government. "It
shows that the different groups are clubbing together," said one.
   "They've conducted joint operations before but this is the first
time I remember one group specifically asking for the release of
a member another group." Layada, who has been in prison for almost
year, was arrested in Morocco in January 1993 under an extradition
agreement with Algeria.
   Algeria's neighbours -- Morocco and Tunisia in particular --
fear the country's militant insurgency will spill over their
borders, so are helping in any way they can by cooperating closely
with the Algerian authorities.
   The country has been in political turmoil since January 1992
when the army intervened to prevent a victory by the FIS in the
country's first multi-party elections.
   Violence exploded across the country despite the proclamation
of a state of emergency and the imposition of a curfew in the 10
central districts of the country.
   The unrest is fueled by the spiralling economic crisis. Caught
between the fall in world oil prices, a slowdown in outside
investments and the troubles of industry, almost 1.4 million out
of Algeria's 5.3 million labour force are out of a job.
   The unemployment rate has risen by 32 percent in the past three
years. According to official statistics some 84.5 percent of the
registered jobless are aged between 16 and 29, and 68 percent of
these have never worked. A majority have no skills.
   The problem was met by a 40 percent devaluation of the dinar
accompanied by an increase in interest rates to discourage
inflation in April.
   In return, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) promised
Algeria a stand-by credit of one billion dollars, opening the way
for a re-scheduling of its $26 billion foreign debt and for new
credits from other donors.

ALGERIA:  ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT DETERMINED NOT TO MERGE
          WITH OTHER MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALIST ORGANIZATIONS

   CAIRO, July 31 (IPS) -- Indications that the Islamic radical
movement in Algeria is in turmoil were reinforced this week by
statements by one faction resisting alliance with other groups, and
reports that some armed groups are operating in support of each
other.
   Militants from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) demanded the
freedom of a leader of another radical group after they released
two Arab ambassadors they had kidnapped a week earlier.
   The GIA is blamed for a series of murders of foreigners but had
promised to end the campaign if the authorities released Abdelhak
Layada, a senior figure in the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA).
   Western diplomats in the capital, Algiers, told IPS this week
that the GIA had changed its mind about trading the two
ambassadors, Kassem Asker Djebrani of Yemen and Hill Bin Salem
Assiyabi of Oman, for Layada.
   Around 4,000 people -- mainly security personnel and militants
-- have been killed in almost three years of violence since the
government canceled elections in January 1992 which the Islamic
radicals were poised to win.
   The MIA is linked to the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS) which won most of the votes. But the FIS is divided into
several factions, some of which are ready to talk with the
authorities, some of which want to fight on.
   Early in the week a leader of one of these factions denied
reports that the FIS -- the largest of the armed groups -- was to
merge with the other two Islamic groups.
   "The broad-based FIS will continue to exist as the Islamic
Salvation Front and will not dissolve itself into another
organisation for illegitimate reasons," said a faxed communique'
received in Paris from FIS spokesman-in-exile Rabah Kebir.
   Earlier this month a similar statement signed by FIS leader
Anouar Nasr Eddine Haddam said the FIS's armed wing was to merge
with the GIA and MIA -- under the GIA's name.
   Kebir's message called on FIS "fighters in the field" to "devote
themselves to fighting and to leave larger issues to their
commanders."
   Diplomats say the GIA demand for the release of an MIA member
is a "serious development" for the government. "It shows that the
different groups are clubbing together," said one.
   "They've conducted joint operations before but this is the first
time I remember one group specifically asking for the release of
a member of another group." Layada, who has been in prison for
almost year, was arrested in Morocco in January 1993 under an
extradition agreement with Algeria.
   "There was a lot of debate within the GIA about what to do if
the government refused to cave in to their demands," said one
diplomat. "In the end they decided to release the two because they
were Arabs and good Muslims."
   Once released, the two ambassadors handed a message from the GIA
to government officials making the offer of ending their killing
of foreigners in return for Layada.
   Government officials refused to comment on the militant demand.
But in a statement, they said that "Algeria reasserts its
determination to follow up its efforts to protect its hosts and
visitors in accordance with the noble principles of Islam."
   After a lull in the spring months, the number of killings has
rocketed. At least 42 foreigners have been killed since the GIA
warned all foreigners to leave Algeria by December last year.
   On July 11, seven foreigners -- four Russians, two Yugoslavs and
one Rumanian were killed. On July 20, a local journalist with the
national news agency, the Algerian Press Service (APS), was gunned
down in front of his home.
   A journalist with APS, who did not want to be named, told IPS
she was scared. "We're all keeping a low profile," she said by
phone on July 25. "We don't know who's going to be killed next."

PAKISTAN:  SECTARIAN CLASHES BETWEEN SHI'ITE AND SUNNI MUSLIMS
           CONTINUE TO ROCK KARACHI

By Imran Munir
   ISLAMABAD, July 31 (IPS) -- Pakistan's largest city of Karachi
continued to be disturbed this week by gun battles between
sectarian groups that the government is blaming on Indian agents.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who has accused India of fanning
trouble in her home province of Sindh, of which Karachi is the
capital, has called a special meeting of her cabinet in the city
to discuss ways to end the violence.
   Activists of the Shi'ite Tehrik-i-Jaffaria were again exchanging
fire with supporters of the fanatical Sunni Sipan-i- Sahaba in
various parts of Karachi, agencies report.
   Karachi has been almost shut down by the gun fights, violence
and killings that broke out July 22, and has so far claimed the
lives of nine people.
   The violence was sparked off by a grenade attack on a coach of
Sunni Muslims returning from a religious ceremony. Now it has
snowballed into a familiar pattern of revenge attacks.
   Six Shi'ite worshipers were injured by unidentified gunmen as
they were leaving a mosque after morning prayers on July 24.
   On the same day in another part of the city a police constable
was gunned down by masked youths, and the body of an unidentified
man who had been shot through the head was found.
   The city was only just recovering from a round of sectarian
clashes between April 29 and May 5. Factional strife within the
powerful Mohajir Quami Movement (MQM) of Muslim refugees from India
is claimed to be behind the violence.
   Premier Bhutto claims the MQM has been infiltrated by Indian
intelligence agents who are plotting to destabilize her government
and the country.
   Pakistani intelligence reports allege they have evidence. Secret
reports of the Interior Ministry corroborate the charges.
   The Bhutto government has called a cabinet meeting in Karachi
to discuss ways to renew contacts with the MQM in order to resolve
the ongoing crisis.
   The government seems to have realized the failure of previous
measures and now feels it must include all groups including the MQM
in discussions to end the sectarian feuding in Karachi.

BRITAIN:  HINDUS FIGHT TO KEEP THEIR TEMPLE FESTIVAL DAYS

By Susan Litherland
   LONDON, July 31 (IPS) -- If ever an arranged marriage faced
problems it is the one innocently orchestrated by a former rock
star between a popular British Hindu sect and residents of a
classic leafy English village.
   Letchmore Heath in Hertfordshire, home to wealthy London
commuters, nestles in picturesque fashion around a pub on the
green, a duck pond and blacksmith. In its midst stands a holy Hindu
shrine visited some six days a year by thousands of worshippers.
   The problem, according to the local Hertsmere Council's managing
director Philip Copland, is that the Hindus only have permission
to use it as a theological college. They are contravening the law,
which is made worse by the large number of devotees who visit the
temple.
   Akhandadhi Das, president of the temple, argues, "Without a
shrine there could be no question of training priests. We teach all
aspects of the worship of Krishna which the general Hindu community
finds fulfilling. Naturally they want to come and worship."
   Twenty-one years ago Bhaktivedanta Manor, a 19th century mock
Tudor mansion set in 17 acres of grounds, was donated to the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness by George Harrison,
a member of The Beatles pop group.
   The tussle between Krishnas and locals heated up in the mid-80s
when Hertsmere Council sought to limit the numbers of people
attending festival days.
   Before long, the numbers crept back up to about 20,000, the
council went to the High Court, and were told the best way to
control the situation was to issue an enforcement notice that would
prevent the manor from operating as a temple.
   The Krishnas appealed and were turned down. They went to the
European Commission in March for help but were told rights of
worship didn't necessarily overrule the planning laws of Britain.
The council was deemed just and once more issued an enforcement
order.
   Copland says: "These days we still get more than 12,000 people
gathering at the temple on festival days.
   "Some council members believe that despite the proposed access
road, this is not acceptable in a village like Letchmore Heath."
   To strengthen their case the Krishnas have proposed building an
access road, at their own expense, that would take traffic away
from the village center.
   They have already paid a deposit of 100,000 pounds ($150,000)
for the option to purchase the land, and say the total cost would
be in the region of one million pounds ($1.5 million).
   A decision on the proposal was expected last week but the
council failed to reach agreement and deferred it until October.
   Naresh Chadha, chairman of the Temple Defence Movement, was
unsurprised at the dithering. He claims the Conservatives in the
jointly-run council came with a pile of amendments determined not
to allow the scheme to go ahead. "They arrived full of pre-
conceptions," he points out.
   Some members of the Hindu community claim it has less to do with
traffic than with racial prejudice. Sorita Bhatia, a journalist on
the London-based Asian newspaper Eastern Eye, is convinced
religious discrimination is at play.
   "The offices of the racist, right-wing British National Party
are allowed to stay open despite national pressure, but our temple
may have to close due to trouble stirred up by a few local
villagers," she says.
   There are rows going on throughout the country over the siting
of mosques, but because Hindus are less vocal their temples don't
get public support, she adds.
   Chadha claims it has more to do with snobbery. "The main issue
is that property values may be affected by a lot of Hindus visiting
the village."
   If the application is finally turned down the Krishnas will take
their fight to the Department of the Environment. Their
determination not to be moved to a possibly less sensitive site is
rooted in the manor's history.
   Harrison gave the house to Srila Prabhupada, founder of the
sect, who lived there periodically between 1973 and his death in
1977.
   "Once a Hindu temple has been established, it can never be
moved. We will defend it vigorously," warned Chadha. "We will form
a housing trust and buy up every house that goes up for sale in the
village."
   It is not an idle threat. The sect is backed by the immensely
wealthy Hinduja family who live in Britain. Indeed, the matter has
been taken as high as the Indian parliament.
   Chadha has held meetings with L.K. Advani, leader of the
opposition Hindu Bharatiya Janata party who has promised he will
do anything he can to help.
   The Congress government has been sufficiently rattled to send
a senior minister, Kamal Nath, to Britain to warn ministers that
British contracts could be at risk over the row.
   It was reported in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that Prime
Minister John Major was sympathetic to the Krishna's case, but
could not intervene in a local government matter. That, says
Chadha, hasn't changed.
   A possible flashpoint could be the celebrations for Krishna's
birthday at the end of August. A two-day affair, Copland says it
will involve "lots of noisy chanting and fireworks". He believes
the council will enforce against it.
   "We have suggested to the Krishnas that they might consider
holding it in a nearby country park. Devotees could come to the
manor, worship before the statues, and then be bussed to the park.
Their response seems to be favorable."
   Whatever the outcome of the October council meeting, the row
seems set to rumble on indeterminately. The Department of the
Environment cannot close the theological college, even if it does
prevent worshippers entering the temple.
   If that happens, the villagers are likely to find devotees
practicing their religion outside the temple gates.

SUDAN:  REBELS REJECT KHARTOUM'S UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE

By Horace Awori
   NAIROBI, July 31 (IPS) -- Southern Sudanese rebels have rejected
a unilateral ceasefire declared by the government that was due to
come into effect at midnight on July 30.
   "The ceasefire is a sham. It has been calculated to deceive the
people of Sudan and the international community", said Steven Wondu
of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
   He said the military government of Lt-Gen. Omar Hassan al Bashir
had launched three major offensives against the SPLA stronghold at
Nimule on the Uganda border in the past few days.
   "As I speak now, heavy fighting is continuing. We have repulsed
three attacks which were preceded by heavy bombardments," Wondu
claimed.
   He said the Sudanese government forces lost 739 troops in the
battle of Nimule when they tried to cross the Awa River to enter
the city.
   Government forces had captured the adjacent towns of Pageri and
Aswa about three months ago, and have been pushing on to dislodge
the rebels from Nimule.
   Wondu, who represents an SPLA faction led by Col. John Garang,
described the ceasefire declaration, announced over state-run Radio
Omdurman as "unprocedural."
   He said, "President Daniel Moi (of Kenya), who is the chairman
of the (peace) talks, had appealed for a ceasefire and any response
should have been formally presented to him and the negotiators for
discussion."
   Wondu said the SPLA had immediately given a formal response to
Moi's appeal and "we are surprised that the chairman of the talks
learnt of the (government's) ceasefire through the press."
   He claimed that the ceasefire only covered gunfire, leaving out
aerial bombardments and troop movements. "This renders it
meaningless and insincere and we shall continue to defend
ourselves."
   Wondu said the SPLA would only reciprocate if Khartoum accepted
an internationally monitored ceasefire within the context of the
six-nation IGADD peace initiative.
   The Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Desertification
(IGADD), which is brokering the ongoing peace talks between the
Sudanese government and the two factions of the SPLA here, groups
Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda.
   According to Wondu, the talks, which have been going on behind
closed doors center on demand for self-determination for the south
and a secular arrangement for a proposed interim period that would
precede separate statehood for the region.
   "We in the SPLA unconditionally accept these principles and will
only negotiate on their basis," said Wondu.
   The SPLA has been fighting against domination of the mainly
Christian-African south by the Arab-Islamic north since 1983. More
than a million people have been killed and another three million
displaced in the fighting.
   Earlier mediations by Nigeria and by former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter failed to make any headway.
   But the SPLA itself is divided. The rebel movement split into
two groups in 1991.
   Early this week the factions clashed in the Bahr-el-Ghazal
region in southern Sudan and 1,000 people were killed, according
to a Catholic bishop in the area.

ULSTER:  IRA'S POLITICAL WING DEFENDS REJECTION OF PEACE PLAN

By Sarah O'Hara
   DUBLIN, July 31 (IPS) -- Northern Irish republican leader Gerry
Adams this week put a positive face on the weekend rejection of a
Anglo-Irish peace plan by political representatives of guerrillas
fighting British rule in the disputed province.
   Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein -- the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), which has waged a 25-year war against
British rule in Northern Ireland -- insisted that the peace process
was still alive, despite his party's rejection of the initiative.
   "We have a peace process which can't be stopped," he said in
reviewing the conference in Letterkenny, in the Republic of
Ireland. "It may be too slow but it can't be stopped and that is
a point that is missed, you see. People miss the big picture."
   Sinn Fein, which represents only one in ten voters in Northern
Ireland, has held center stage for most of the last eight months
since the British and Irish prime ministers began a joint peace
initiative with the so-called Downing Street Declaration.
   The Declaration attempts to recognize the rights of both the
majority Northern Irish Protestant community to remain part of the
United Kingdom and the minority Catholic community to its
aspiration for a united Ireland.
   Both Irish and British leaders hoped it would encourage the IRA
to call a permanent ceasefire in return for a place at the
negotiating table alongside Irish, British and Northern Irish
constitutional parties.
   But Sinn Fein again refused to either accept or reject the
Declaration, arguing instead that the British government should
"join the persuaders" in trying to convince the pro-British
Protestant majority that they could live in a united Ireland.
   Meanwhile the IRA has continued its armed struggle with British
forces, and attempted new bombing attacks against targets on the
British mainland.
   Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds, was surprisingly upbeat
in his response, saying this week that he could see "some positive
signals" from Sinn Fein.
   He said the peace process would continue, with or without Sinn
Fein and that his government would go on searching for agreement
with Britain on new political structures for Northern Ireland
(Ulster).
   In contrast, his Deputy Dick Spring, also shadow foreign
minister and leader of the Irish Labour Party, described the
Letterkenny conference decision as sickening. "I think we must be
living in totally different worlds if Sinn Fein sees the conference
as a positive development," he said.
   And British government Minister for Northern Ireland Patrick
Mayhew said the initiative for peace did not rest with Sinn Fein
and that Sinn Fein were "rejecting democracy" because they could
not achieve their aims through the ballot box.
   Mayhew said the two governments were preparing a framework
document, to establish new relationships between North and South,
and between the Irish and British governments as well.
   Of Sinn Fein, he said, "We have never waited upon them. We have
not been spending several months waiting, twiddling our thumbs, to
see what Sinn Fein were going to do. We have been pressing on, the
two governments and the constitutional parties, with our political
work. We've got to go on doing that and we will."
   Reynolds, who leads the populist Fianna Fail party in a
coalition government with Labour, is now under pressure from Irish
opposition politicians suspicious of the motivations of the IRA.
   John Bruton, leader of the conservative opposition party, Fine
Gael, said the Declaration had not progressed peace. He believed
it was "ultimately futile" to expect a ceasefire from the IRA,
which he described as "a classic revolutionary organisation".
   "They use violence some of the time, they use artificial offers
of peace at other times and they use these to break the will of
democratic politicians," he said.
   Adams said that the peace process had been "kick-started" by
himself and the leader of the constitutional nationalist SDLP, John
Hume, "nurtured" by the Irish government,  and "helped" by
"nationalist Ireland", with no assistance from the British.
   "What we did yesterday was to give a considered and detailed
response to the Downing Street Declaration. We're the only party
to give such a detailed response to the Declaration," he said.
   "What we have done is to isolate positive elements (in the
Declaration) that can be built up and negative elements which we
can seek to revoke. The governments never said it was a solution,
the governments said it was a step forward.
   Much of the thinking on the part of the Irish government over
the last eight months has been based on the idea that Adams
represents a significant grouping within Sinn Fein and IRA which
would like to see an end to the conflict.
   However many "doves" in the republican movement may not be
prepared to force the issue, for fear it would split the IRA and
produce a newer, more vicious group.

TIBET:  DALAI LAMA TO ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL STUDENT FESTIVAL

   OSLO, July 31 (IPS) -- Tibetan leader-in-exile and Nobel Prize
winner, the Dalai Lama, will visit the Norwegian city of Trondheim
in October to address the International Student Festival in
Trondheim (ISFiT).
   The main theme of the festival from Oct 6-15 is Human Rights,
said festival organizer Rina Sunder and ISFiT Head of Groups Lars
Bjoergan Schroeder. They travelled to Dharamsala, India, where the
Dalai Lama lives in exile, to secure his support.
   The two students made a personal representation after the
Tibetan leader's representatives in London and Dharamsala initially
declined the invitation on his behalf. While in India the two also
invited a number of Indian government officials and human rights
activists who will also attend the ISFiT events.
   His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, to his followers the "earthly
manifestation of the Avalokiteshvara, Bodhisattva of Compassion"
has spent over 35 years trying to find a non-violent response to
the armed invasion and annexation of his historic homeland.
   Since the Chinese invaded in 1959, Tibet's temples have been
razed, its natural resources plundered and its lands seized for
Chinese settlers and nuclear facilities. The Tibetan environment
has been degraded and a long list of human rights violations have
seen monks and nuns persecuted and people imprisoned without trial.
   "I am fighting for the maintenance of our culture and our
identity," he told IPS in an interview this year. He says one
million Tibetans have died since China invaded in 1949. Since then
Tibet's spiritual leader has made representations world wide to
raise violations of human rights by the Chinese in his country.
   "Tibetans are, at best, second class citizens in their own
country. Deprived of all basis democratic rights and freedoms, they
exist under a colonial administration in which all real power is
wielded by Chinese Communist party and the army," he told IPS.
   The International Student Festival in Trondheim will bring more
than 500 students from 100 countries to what is Europe's most
comprehensive student conference with debate meetings, academic
seminars, work groups and concerts, all on a human rights theme.
   The festival has its own newspaper and will run their own radio
station during the festival. ISFiT is a non-profit festival
financed mainly by the University of Trondheim and Norwegian
government departments and agencies.

CARIBBEAN:  REGIONAL WOMEN ACTIVELY OPPOSING VATICAN'S
            UNCOMPROMISING POSITION AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS

By Sheila Rampersad
   PORT OF SPAIN, July 31 (IPS) -- Women's groups in the Caribbean
have joined the international women's movement in opposing the
Vatican's uncompromising anti-abortion position and have insisted
that population policy cannot be discussed in isolation from
reproductive rights and therefore women's rights.
   "Unsafe abortions are a major cause of death, therefore access
to safe abortion should be an integral part of reproductive health
services," says a non-governmental organisation position paper that
will be presented at the World Women's Conference in China next
year.
   The position paper echoes the view of the Caribbean Association
for Feminist Research and Action (CAFRA). The paper noted that Cuba
and Barbados are among the few Caribbean countries that have
decriminalized abortions. A draft bill to achieve this in Guyana
is currently before the Parliament there.
   CAFRA's voice is strong on the connection between reproductive
health and women's rights.
   "In the context of the upcoming International Conference on
Population and Development Caribbean governments should be urged
to actively resist attempts to reject the new framework of
reproductive health and rights which has been negotiated by most
governments, in support of the advocacy of the international
women's movement," the document states.
   The Caribbean's population and family planning experts will
support the CAFRA position this September at the Population
Conference to be held in Cairo, Egypt.
   The Caribbean's policy position states: "Unsafe abortion is also
one of the most neglected underlying causes of reproductive ill
health in the Caribbean and constitutes a major unrecognized social
health issue.
   "Women, adolescents and disadvantaged population groups are
particularly vulnerable to all aspects of reproductive ill health
and satisfactory outcomes cannot be achieved without the full
involvement of both men and women."
   The regional position, outlined in the Port of Spain
Declaration, calls for "the provision of appropriate information
and services in order to prevent unsafe abortions and to ensure
high-quality standards for abortion-related services for
individuals and couples."
   Although there are no data available on just how many illegal
abortions occur in the region, research by CAFRA member Nesha
Haniff shows that many women opt for the unsafe, backyard
procedure.
   According to Haniff, in Guyana, where health care is very poor
and where available, is costly, the rate of abortion is considered
extremely high, although no official figures exist.
   Abortion costs between almost seven dollars (900 Guyanese
dollars) and $15 (2,000 Guyanese dollars).
   "Women interviewed before their abortions said the health system
had failed them and this was being used as a contraceptive device.
They preferred a more long-term, uncomplicated contraceptive with
low maintenance. They had difficulty accepting abortion as an
alternative but wanted to exert control over the pregnancy. Condom
use was intermittent," Haniff said.
   Additionally because of its illegality, many women opt for folk
remedies for unwanted pregnancies.
   In St. Lucia, abortions are also illegal but unlike Guyana,
there is not the same tacit acceptance, according to Haniff.
   "The Catholic religion is very influential, advocating natural
contraceptive methods only and has been problematic for the St.
Lucia Planned parenthood Association," she said.
   In 1983, the crude birth rate was 30 per thousand and St.
Lucia's population was growing at the rate of two percent per
annum. High unemployment, compounded by rapid population growth and
a mounting dependency burden on the state led the government in
1990 to establish the National Population Unit.
   Arguing that reproductive rights are human rights, women's
groups in the Dominican Republic point out that an estimated 25 to
50 percent of maternal deaths in that country are a result of
illegal abortions.
   They estimate that approximately 70,000 women risk their lives
each year in back street procedures. They say that 40 percent of
births in the last five years were unwanted and that 17 percent of
women in a relationship have an unsatisfied demand for
contraceptives.
   Groups in Puerto Rico, where abortion is legalized, report that
since legalization, the number of deaths associated with abortion
has declined considerably.

BANGLADESH:  DHAKA QUIET DURING TWIN ANTI-NASREEN RALLIES

By Tabibul Islam
   DHAKA, July 31 (IPS) -- Leaders of right-wing Islamic groups
warned at two rallies in the Bangladesh capital July 29 that the
government would have to face the consequences if fugitive writer
Taslima Nasreen was not punished.
   Several thousand people mobilized to attend the twin rallies
called separately by the Jamaat-e-Islami and an alliance of 13
other radical parties, listened patiently as their leaders
threatened to launch demonstrations against the government.
   The fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islamic and the United Action
Council Alliance are separately campaigning for the hanging of the
controversial writer, to make Bangladesh an Islamic republic and
a ban on newspapers and organizations they call anti-Islamic.
   Though the twin rallies passed off uneventfully, security still
remains tight in Dhaka, which has been disturbed by nearly daily
protests, marches and demonstrations by opponents and supporters
of the controversial feminist author.
   The Alliance has given the Khaleda Zia administration seven days
to arrest Nasreen, who went into hiding on June 4 to escape an
arrest warrant and a fatwa for blasphemy.
   At least 100,000 people attended the Alliance rally, but the
much larger one was the rally of the Jamaat-e-Islami which was held
near the Baitulmukarram national mosque in Dhaka.
   Speakers at both the rallies described 32-year-old Nasreen as
a creation of India and the Western world.
   Jamaat chief Golam Azam thundered "Taslima Nasreen was an
unknown writer...she was created by the Western world and India to
malign Islam," he thundered.
   S.M. Suleiman of the Alliance urged the government to scrap all
treaties with India and boycott all Indian goods.
   However, Golam Azam, trying to strike a more balanced note, said
his party was keen on maintaining good relations with its giant
neighbor to the west. "But India must not encourage those attacking
Islam," he added.
   Religious extremists have accused India of supporting Nasreen,
who first raised a storm last year after the publication of her
book "Lajja" (Shame), a story of a Hindu family in Bangladesh
during the riots that swept the country in December 1992.
   The head of a then little-known radical group in the Bangladeshi
town of Sylhet issued a fatwa against Nasreen and a huge cash
reward.
   Nasreen was living under police protection in Dhaka until June
3 when a warrant for her arrest was issued by a Bangladeshi court
for her provocative interview to the Indian newspaper, The
Statesman.
   The English-language daily, published from Calcutta, quotes the
outspoken writer calling for a revision of the Koran. Nasreen has
said she was misquoted.
   Almost daily strikes and protests between Nasreen's opponents
and supporters, who believe she has the right to freedom of speech,
disrupted normal life in Bangladesh through June.
   The Bangladesh government is under pressure from the West to
protect the 32-year-old fugitive writer who is being described as
the female Salman Rushdie.
   Nasreen is accused of "maliciously outraging the religious
feelings of Muslims", a charge the religious extremists insist must
be punished with death.

[] IN A NEW MOVE, USA PRESBYTERIANS
CONVENE REGIONAL CAMPING MINISTRY REPRESENTATIVES
TO PROBE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF WORKING TOGETHER MORE CLOSELY

92031            CAMP MINISTRY CONSULTATION SET

LOUISVILLE, Ky.--A first for the Presbyterian Church will be a
gathering of representatives from church camp and conference
centers across the denomination.

     The national conference centers, Montreat, Ghost Ranch and
Stony Point are well-known, but there are many others serving
presbyteries and synods throughout the church.  Associates from
many of these will gather Jan. 30 and Feb. 1.  Representatives from
ministry units and other entities will also attend.

     The event will be held at General Butler State Park, located
between Louisville and Cincinnati.

     The purpose of the consultation, which is called Weaving our
Ministry, is to explore mutual benefits for partnerships.  This
will include new ways in which the camp and conference group and
the national conference centers might better assist the units and
other groups within the church in carrying out their mission.  It
also will include ways for the General Assembly entities to make
more use of the centers.

     This gathering will help prepare Presbyterian camp and
conference representatives for participation in the Council on
Religiously Affiliated Camps Consultation, according to the Rev.
Ed Craxton, staff for the event.  That consultation will held in
the spring.  It is a division of the American Camping Association.

     Anyone interested in attending the consultation Jan. 30 should
contaxt Craxton at 100 Witherspoon Street, Louisville, KY  40202-
1396, (502) 569-5447.

[] EIGHT USA CHURCH DENOMINATIONS OPPOSE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

92032       STATEMENT ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ANNOUNCED

PHOENIX--Eight denominational representatives including the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), recently signed a statement against
the death penalty in Arizona.  Signing for the Presbyterian Church
were the Rev. Robert V. Chapman, executive, Presbytery of the Grand
Canyon, and the Rev. Gary Skinner, executive, Synod of the
Southwest.  Other denominational leaders signing were from the
Episcopal Church, Roman Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, Society of Friends, United Church of Christ, the
Disciples of Christ and the Unitarian-Universalist.

     The statement said:

"At this time, when 102 persons in Arizona are on death row and an
execution appears imminent, we affirm our unity in opposing capital
punishment.  As Christian leaders we want to bear witness that the
death penalty cannot be justified as a legitimate tool of society's
justice system.  The denominations we represent in Arizona all have
spoken nationally against the death penalty.

"Christians of good will disagree on the use of the death penalty
as a means of achieving justice in our society.  We acknowledge
these differences of opinion.  We also join with all of our
brothers and sisters in their feelings of anger at heinous acts of
violence and in compassion for those among us whose loved ones have
been victims of such crimes.

"While there are many important sociological arguments against
capital punishment and while empirical evidence does not
demonstrate that executing prisoners has served to reduce crime,
our opposition relies principally on our faith vision of human
dignity and solidarity.

"As Christians and, indeed, as citizens of the United States, we
are proud of the mercy as well as justice which have so often
characterized our nation's history.  We believe that punishment
should be primarily redemptive, reformative and restorative.
Capital punishment does not lead us to these goals, either for the
victim or for the criminal.  The taking of one human life to serve
notice on the lives of others is in itself violent and cruel.  The
use of the death penalty is inconsistent with the Christian calling
to honor the sanctity of all of human life.  We must work to
curtail, not to promote, violence in our society by carrying the
message of God's redeeming love in all of our public and private
interactions.

"Jesus Christ, and countless historical examples, teach us that no
human being is beyond redemption.  The institutional taking of a
human life destroys forever the opportunity to seek reconciliation
of the offender and causes all of us to share in the violent act
of killing a person.  The judgment of life and death is God's
alone.  When one human being places himself or herself in the
position of making that judgment by murdering another human being,
it is a sin.  That sin is compounded when society responds in kind.

"There should be appropriate punishment for those who commit
crimes, however it is our firm conviction that to succumb to the
retaliatory violence of capital punishment is abdicating our
responsibility as Christians and as human beings.

"Our fervent prayer is that God's redemptive love will be better
served in human affairs through the abolition of this cruel and
inhuman form of punishment.  We pray, too, that society will find
more effective ways to serve the victims of crimes and their
families, offering them assistance to recover as completely as
possible from the harm they have suffered.  May the values of mercy
and compassion which have marked the best of our nation's history
overcome the spirit of vengeance epitomized in capital punishment."

[] FROM A COMMUNITY NEWSPAPER:
NORTH CAROLINIANS SHARE CHRISTMAS WITH FOREIGN STUDENTS

92028           FOREIGN STUDENTS SHARE CHRISTMAS

EDITOR'S NOTE:  This article appeared in The Herald, in Rock Hill,
S.C.  We thought our readers would enjoy reading it.--Marj
Carpenter

ROCK HILL, S.C.--Christmas week has been a time to rest and
celebrate the holidays for about 24 foreign students visiting the
Christmas International House at Bethelwoods Christian Education
Center.

     The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)-sponsored project provides
international students who can't get home for the holidays the
chance to spend that time with others.

     One of the students, Robson Gomes, 30, of Brazil also brought
along his wife and two daughters, who are with him while he's
studying in the United States, for the holiday experience.  He is
a student at Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va.

     "This has been a time to rest, a time to be with family and
a time to think," Gomes said, "and to meet different people."

     Being at Bethelwoods and enjoying the natural beauty of the
area also has given him time to remember God, he said.

     "My girls love it.  They don't want to go home" to Richmond,
he said.

     Gomes will speak at Hermon Presbyterian Church in Rock Hill.

     "I won't preach.  I talk, sharing my experiences with God.
It's not like a sermon," he said, adding that he has been at the
seminary five months and expects to graduate in May 1994.

     Michihiko Ogata, 23, has been a graduate student in computer
science at Ohio University since March 1990.

     Relaxing in the game room at Bethelwoods after a tour of WRHI-
AM radio station and before a trip to the Outlet Market Place,
Ogata, a Tokyo native, talked a little about the differences
between Christmas in his country and here.

     "We don't celebrate Christmas like this.  We don't decorate
the tree.  We don't have a big tree," he said with a smile.  "We
can go to a restaurant or department store and see trees
decorated."

     The Japanese buy small artificial trees already decorated,
Ogata said.

     This is his second Christmas away from his family and he
misses them.  But - and he smiled again - he misses his dog more.

     Bethelwoods is one of only two Christmas International Houses
in the country that are operated out of a camp, said Joel Winchip
of Columbia, S.C., a student at the Presbyterian School of
Christian Education in Richmond.

     The Presbyterian church helps match foreign students in other
areas with host families.

     The students at Bethelwoods this year come from Japan, Taiwan,
Kenya, Brazil, El Salvador and Costa Rica.  They arrived Dec. 19
and return to campuses around the country the following week.

     They register for the International House by paying $25 fee
and list the first, second and third choices they would like to
visit, Winchip said.

     Since arriving, the students have visited churches including
Oakland Avenue Presbyterian in Rock Hill and First Presbyterian in
Lancaster.  They enjoyed a Christmas party at Tirzah Presbyterian
and were entertained by the Uriel Cloggers.

     The group also has visited Kings Mountain State Park and
toured the S.C. State Museum and Zoo.  On Christmas Day, they drove
up to Montreat, N.C., in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Before they
leave, they will tour Brattonsville, Discovery Place and the
Charlotte Observer Omnimax Theatre.

     The project is supported by Providence Presbytery, with 18
churches providing money and food for the students.

[] SCRIPT OF 'WEEKENDER', THE USA PRESBYTERIAN PHONE RECORDING:
UPDATE ON ZAIRE, HAITI, JANUARY 10-17, 1992

             WEEKENDER #124 - JANUARY 10 - 17, 1992

     Greetings from Louisville, Kentucky.  This is Betsey Kandle
for Weekender.

     Many Presbyterian mission co-workers have been hindered in
their work by political coups and civil wars that have made it
necessary for some to return to the United States.  Two nations
in particular, Zaire and Haiti, have suffered profound political
strife which is still going on.

     Tom and Noretta Clayton were forced to leave their home in
Haiti last October.  Tom Clayton spoke about his adopted country
at a worship service at the Presbyterian Center in Louisville
this week.  Here are some of his thoughts.


     "This is a time filled with confusion and rumors when your
prayers for the people of Haiti are badly, badly needed.
Meanwhile, Presbyterian work goes on, limited, but goes on.

     "The last 200 years, has seen Haiti stripped of 80% of its
forests.  Nature continues to tear at what is left of the
country.  Today, Haiti is a land of rocks and barren mountains,
with only small pockets of lush, green, life.

     "But, in a small area near the Dominican Republic border,
the people have built an irrigation canal, a project called
Chadev, with the help of mission funds from the Presbyterian
Church.  Now after ten years, they are reaping a harvest of
better and more plentiful food.  And their work continues, or at
least will when things settle down.

     "In the district of Cormiers, the people have organized
themselves and are working to reclaim a watershed area that is
home for thousands with the help of Presbyterian missionaries and
mission funds.  This project is truly ecumenical - it includes
the local Episcopal and Catholic parishes, an Evangelical School
and a small clinic run by the Catholic Little Brothers.  Rodney
Babe, a Presbyterian agriculturalist, and his wife will be
working with the project when it is appropriate for them to
return.  They left when we did in early October.  My wife, Nory,
serves as administrator of the project and liaison between the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti.

     "Today, on the island of LaGonave, in the middle of the bay,
there is a small clinic established by the local Episcopal parish
under the leadership of Pere Valdema and with the assistance of
mission funds from the Presbyterian Church.  Nory and I work very
closely with that group.  With the help of a small group of
dedicated community health workers, trained at Hospital Ste.
Croix and working with the people of the Episcopal Church located
next to the clinic, they are working to provide both
preventative and curative care to a population of more than
10,000 people.

     "In the city of Cap Haitian, there is a trade school
teaching a variety of skills in a three year course, with an
enrollment of 500.  In the country, near the city, there is an
Agricultural School with demonstration lands, teaching people to
teach agriculture.  Both of these schools are assisted by mission
funds from the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).

     "And on the southern coast of the country, in a small
village called Leogane, there is the Hospital Ste. Croix.
Started by missionaries and mission funds from the Presbyterian
Church in the early 1960's, it is now staffed entirely by
Haitians and is held as a model of what health care in Haiti can
be.  Dr. David McNeeley, a Presbyterian missionary and Episcopal
priest is the medical director.  His wife, Dr. Marise McNeeley,
also a Presbyterian missionary heads the laboratory and blood
bank.  The Drs. McNeeley are still in Haiti and although the
hospital staff has been cut in half, they are still providing
what care they can to the people of the surrounding area.  My
wife and I continue to work as consultants in pharmacy,
procurement, and administration to the hospital.

     "But we want you to understand that it is not just mission
funds or missionaries or even Haitians that get this work done.
It is through God's Grace and your prayers that His work is done.
Thank you from the people of Haiti."

[] SCRIPT FOR 'WEEKENDER', USA PRESBYTERIAN PHONE MESSAGE SERVICE:
MORE ON HAITI, ESPECIALLY CHURCH WORLD SERVICE EFFORTS AMONG REFUGEES

              WEEKENDER #125 -- JANUARY 17-24, 1992

     Greetings from Louisville, Kentucky.  This is Gregg Kapfhammer
for Weekender.

     Thousands of Haitians took to the sea in small boats last
October following the takeover of their country by the military.
They risked their lives in search of freedom and security, were
caught by the U.S. Coast Guard, and would have been returned to
Haiti except for a court restraining order which is now under
appeal by the Justice Department.  They are confined in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, awaiting the resolution of their destiny.

     As it always does, the church is reaching out to the refugees
through organizations such as Church World Service and Witness and
the U.S. Catholic Conference.  And it is speaking out to Congress
and the Administration, urging justice for the Haitians.

     Dale S. DeHaan, director of the Church World Service
Immigration and Refugee Program, testified before a congressional
immigration sub-committee last November.  He strongly urged
Congress not to allow the administration to return Haitian refugees
to their country by force.  He reminded them of the Immigration Act
of 1990 which authorizes the Attorney General to grant Temporary
Protected Status to nationals from countries experiencing war,

physical safety.  While DeHaan acknowledged that such a grant is
not always the appropriate or necessary response to refugee crises,
he urged that this protection be extended to the Haitians.

     The Church World Service Immigration and Refugee Program is
attempting to resettle 600 of the nearly 1200  Haitians determined
by the government to have a reasonable claim for asylum in the
United States.  Presbyterian churches interested in helping to
resettle Haitian families are encouraged to call the Presbyterian
World Service office in the Social Justice and Peacemaking Ministry
Unit.  The number is 502-569-5840.  Social Justice and Peacemaking
is assisting this program with funds designated for the asylum

NEWS IN BRIEF
FOR CIRCUIT WRITER,
THE UNITED METHODIST COMPUTER COMMUNICATION SERVICE

                                       Jan. 17, 1992

   Of the 50 active U.S. United Methodist bishops, 34 have signed
statements supporting transfers of U.S. bishops across geographically
determined jurisdictional lines, reflecting a never-before-used church
provision.  Eleven said they meet requirements for such transfers and
are willing to serve "wherever assigned," and another 23 active bishops
and 19 retired bishops signed the appeal in support of their colleagues.

   The Rev. Zdravko Beslov, a United Methodist pastor and conference
superintendent in Bulgaria, will become the 15th person to receive the
1992 World Methodist Peace Award in recognition of his efforts to bring
reconciliation and healing in his country.

   United Methodist Bishop Felton E. May, Harrisburg, Pa., Jan. 10 called
on U.S. faith communities to set aside 10 percent of their budgets and
reserve funding "over and above what we are already doing" to fight "the
spiritual crisis" of drugs and violence.  The money, May told the (U.S.)
President's Drug Advisory Council, could "serve as a pump primer" until
"redirected government funds reach the points of need."

   Hope was voiced to U.S. United Methodists visiting Cuba recently that
the U.S. government could be convinced to end its embargo against Cuba.
The Rev. Pedro Mayor, a Cuban Methodist pastor, said that the United
States should at least allow shipment of food and medicine.  Bishop Joel
Ajo of the Methodist Church in Cuba said the blockade is "denying
medicine for our own children and our sick elderly."  The United
Methodist General Conference in 1984 called for lifting the embargo.

   Thousands of boxes of food are being packed in New Windsor, Md., by
volunteers under auspices of the United Methodist Committee on Relief
for shipment by ocean freight to for hungry residents of Moscow.
Additional volunteers to handle the packing are needed.

   United Methodist Bishop David J. Lawson, Sun Prairie, Wisc., and
members of his cabinet have voiced grave concern about membership
recruitment efforts by the Ku Klux Klan in the southeastern part of the
state.  Church members are called on to "make clear that the teaching
and values of the Klan are unacceptable in our communities."

   A dispute between United Methodist-related Boston University and
Coretta Scott King about possession of 83,000 documents of the late Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. must go to trial March 2, a Massachusetts state
judge ruled Jan. 12.  The civil-rights leader's widow has sought return
of papers, while university officials claim King entrusted the papers
to the school with an understanding they would become university
property at his death.  King, who held a doctorate degree from the
university, was assassinated in 1968.

   The Rev. Miron A. Morrill, 93, who was inducted into the United
Methodist Association of Communicators' Hall of Fame in November, died
Jan. 9 in Hesston, Kan., after a lengthy illness.  Morrill directed
press relations for the 1939 Uniting Conference in which three Methodist
bodies became the Methodist Church, and served in 1929-40 in various
posts for the Methodist Episcopal Church, a predecessor body of the
United Methodist Church.  Services were held Jan. 11 in Hesston.  He is
survived by his widow, Naomi.

      INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (DNS) -- Two Ohio women will lead the
boards of directors for the higher education and overseas
ministries units of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) for
the next two years.
      The Rev. Robin E. Hedgeman of Elyria was installed in
November as chairwoman of the Division of Overseas Ministries
board of directors. Hedgeman, associate regional minister for the
Christian Church in Ohio, will lead the DOM governing board until
1993.
      The Rev. Linda Walling of Cleveland is the new chairwoman
for the Division of Higher Education board of directors. Walling,
an associate minister at Heights Christian Church, succeeds the
Rev. Kenneth L. Teegarden of Fort Worth. Hedgeman's and Walling's
appointments are among the highlights of a month-long round of
meetings of general unit governing boards.
      The DOM board also approved six persons for overseas
appointments and named Disciples Africa executive, the Rev. Dan C.
Hoffman, acting executive director of the Common Ministry in
Africa. Hoffman will direct the overseas missions activities for
the DOM and the United Church Board for World Ministries.
      Holly Stovall of Fort Worth, Texas, will serve for two years
with the Disciples of Christ in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she
will work in a day-care center and other outreach ministries.
      Virginia Wilson, Olympia, Wash., was appointed to a two-year
term with the Japan-North America Commission on Cooperative
Mission. She will teach English in a church-related school or
institution in Japan.
      Elvira Likay Arndt, Dr. Joyce Baker and the Rev. John Huegel
were ratified for Common Ministry appointments in Ecuador,
Honduras and Mexico. In other action, Nancy Moulin, Reno, Nev.,
was assigned to a three-year appointment with the United Mission
to Nepal where she will direct the Andhi Khola Project.
      In action taken by the boards of other general units, the
Rev. Raymond E. Brown of Indianapolis has been named interim
president of the Church Finance Council. He succeeds the Rev.
James P. Johnson who becomes president of the Christian Church
Foundation in January 1992. Brown retired in November as senior
vice-president of the Board of Church Extension.
      The Disciples of Christ Historical Society in November
closed its 50th anniversary celebration with a special lecture
series. Richard Harrison of Vanderbilt Divinity School and Douglas
Foster of Abilene (Texas) Christian University addressed the
lecture theme: "Holding Back the Tide: T.B. Larimore and J.W.
McGarvey in the Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ
Division."
      The board of directors, meeting in conjunction with the
lectures, also approved for 1993 an expansion and redesign of the
quarterly journal "Discipliana"; and set Wilson, N.C., as the site
for the 1993 Forrest F. Reed Lectures. The Rev. Kenneth Henry of
the Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Ga., will be
the guest lecturer and will address historic aspects of the Black
Disciples of Christ movement.
      Trustees of the National Benevolent Association recently
approved the purchase of two care facilities for older adults, and
authorized expansion projects involving Robin Run Village in
Indianapolis, and the Beasley Building - home offices for NBA and
the Division of Higher Education - in St. Louis.
      The acquisitions of Village at Skyline at Colorado Springs,
Colo., and Patriot Heights in San Antonio, Texas, bring to 72 the
number of care facilities related to the NBA.
      The Division of Homeland Ministries board, in its recent
meeting, dealt primarily with staff and division restructure and
budget matters, including staff salary increases. Also on the
agenda was a review of the process leading the division to
reorganize into three "ministry centers" intended to focus its
programs more effectively upon congregational ministry.

"SEARCH FOR SPIRITUALITY" TO BROADCAST ON ABC-TV   91b-119

December 11, 1991   Contact: Clifford L. Willis
      NEW YORK, N.Y. (DNS) -- As Americans prepare to address the
quincentary of Columbus' journey to this land, another voyage of a
different kind is being acknowledged . . .  a journey in search of
the spirituality of this nation and its people.
      Intrigued by the seeming emergence of a cultural phenomenon,
the National Council of Churches is documenting the revitalization
of American spirituality in the fourth program of the "Vision and
Values" series on ABC-TV. The program, "Search for Spirituality,"
will be broadcast to ABC affiliates on January 19, 1992. It will
air locally at 1:30 p.m. on WRTV, Channel 6.
      It has been rumored in the media that the movement of
Americans back to church and religion may well mark the popular
trend of the `90s. "Search for Spirituality" probes the questions
that surround the suggestion. Is spirituality just another decade
motif to ring out a century that was marked in the `60s with
revolution, the `70s with drugs, and the `80s with money? Or is it
the bona fide search of a society in pursuit of the boundaries of
collective harmony and corrective healing?
      "There is no question that we're finding a spiritual hunger
from people of all walks of life," said the Rev. Theodore
Nottingham, director of video production for the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), an NCC member communion and program
cosponsor.
      "Unfortunately some people look outside the church for what
is truly the church's mission," Nottingham said. "In a way the
church itself is on a search for spirituality. This search is key
to the church's revitalization."
      "Search of Spirituality" journeys across the country to
document the answers. In California, over 200 people representing
a wide range of faith groups celebrate new ways of worship through
creation-centered rituals. In Chicago, an African-American
Lutheran congregation gives witness to the power and joy of
communal spirituality. In Iowa, 5,000 Presbyterian women gather to
construct new images of God and the church. In New York, 100
Vietnam veterans convene for a retreat at the direction of
Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh to bind the wounds of war into
banners of inner and global peace.
      From gurus to grassroots, spirituality speaks to the seekers
who are redefining their lives under the rubric of personal
transformation and societal renewal. In the process, three central
questions emerge to prod the spiritual quest: Who am I? Who is my
neighbor? Who is God? The journey continues as the answers to each
of these questions unravel the harsh realities of individual lives
and interweaves the responses to form new images of self, neighbor
and God.
      "Search for Spirituality" was produced for the National
Council of Churches by Current Production Group. The
producer/director is John Ankele, and Mary Byrne Hoffman of the
National Council of Churches is the executive producer.

[] FROM DISCIPLES NEWS SERVICE:
STATUS OF MISSIONARIES IN ZAIRE   91b-120

December 11, 1991
Contact: Clifford L. Willis
      INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (DNS) -- The status of nine Christian
Church (Disciples of Christ) missionaries previously stationed in
Zaire has been reevaluated in light of the deteriorating political
and economic situation in the Central African nation.
      Zaire's situation "appears to be moving beyond the critical
stage to chaos," said the Rev. Dan C. Hoffman, Africa executive
for the Disciples' overseas ministries division. "We cannot in
good conscience, leave our staff uncertain about their status and
the possibility of future service.
      "While we are concerned about the lives and ministries of
our overseas staff, we also care deeply about our brothers and
sisters in Zaire," Hoffman said. "We don't know what the future
will bring, but believe an already-difficult situation will
worsen. We ask North American Disciples to join us in prayer for
the church in Zaire as well as for the people."
      Beginning January 1, two missionaries will start terminal
home leave, five will be on home leave until new assignments
develop and two will maintain modified relationships with Zaire.
Those persons affected by the changes are:
      - Amy Hirsch, Tucson, Ariz., and Lois Hodrick, Oakland,
Calif., whose terms end June 30, 1992 and April 30, 1992, will
finish their terms here in the United States.
      - Saul and Maria Falcon will remain in Coronel Oviedo,
Paraguay, on home leave through June 30, 1992. The couple may
return to Zaire or be reassigned elsewhere in Africa, Latin
America or the Caribbean.
      - Daniel and Sandra Gourdet will be on home leave in
Birmingham, Ala., through August 31, 1992, while another
assignment is explored for them in another African nation.
      - Michael Allen, Erie, Pa., is now based in Brazzaville,
Congo, where he will attempt to relate to Zairian churches,
organizations and hospitals in Mbandaka.
      - Robert and Gertrud Muller will continue to be based in
Offerdingen, Germany. Robert Muller will make frequent trips to
the Church of Christ in Zaire's architectural office.
      These changes were approved in November by the Division of
Overseas Ministries board of directors.

[] MISSIONARIES TELL UNITED METHODIST MISSION BOARD OF THEIR WORK

20(10-21-71)                                        Jan. 16, 1992

Mission Interns Share Stories
with Board of Global Ministries


     NEW YORK (UMNS)--When Natasha Kanhai, a United Methodist from
Wisconsin, started working at a slum project in Bombay, India, she
felt frustrated by her lack of ability to communicate.

     The people of the slums spoke a wide variety of languages.
One day, on a field trip to a park, no one could translate.
     Then something happened.  By patching together different
languages, she managed to talk with four women resting in the
shade.  She learned, she said, "to communicate with the heart."

     Kanhai was one of 17 United Methodist mission interns who
shared their stories Jan. 16 at the United Methodist Board of
Global Ministries headquarters here.  Fourteen of them have
returned from 16-month foreign assignments and are starting U.S.
placements.  Three interns had taken a one-year foreign assignment.

     In Zimbabwe, Africa, Don Wilson of South Carolina learned the
"people's theology," which is, he explained, "when you're willing
to step into their situation and see the world from their point of
view," including other perspectives of God.

     Kai Jackson of Georgia, also assigned to Zimbabwe, witnessed
"the power of African women organizing for their own economic
independence."  Jackson's contribution included sponsoring a
doll-making workshop.

     Gina Chamberlain of Illinois turned the frightening experience
of being robbed of a gold cross necklace on the streets of Nairobi,
Kenya, into an examination of what action was being taken to help
the street children who robbed her.

     She realized that merely talking about issues or "going to a
seminar on the debt crisis or on street children didn't affect
those children at all."

     The Board of Global Ministries' three-year mission intern
program--for adults 22-30--combines work and study experiences with
the goals of community-building and cross-cultural interaction.
Participants bring back a new understanding of mission and the
search for justice and become resources for the church.

     Joanne Reich of Florida and Jane Eesley of Illinois, who were
both in Jerusalem, said they saw the everyday life of Palestinians
in a different way than that portrayed by U.S. media.

     Eesley also was concerned with the lack of U.S. Christian
attention to the Palestinians, some of whom are Christian.
"Tremendous numbers of Christians who visit the Holy Land," she
explained, make the trip to "visit stones, not people."

     In the same way, Elizabeth Dillard of Illinois and Allen
Vaughan of Missouri learned of internal refugees and human-rights
violations in the Philippines.

     And beyond the headlines of Eastern Europe, Lonnie Chafin of
Virginia worked at a center in Hungary housing 40 refugees--of
varying ethnic groups--from the war in Yugoslavia. "Instead of
(using) violence, they chose to be a community," he said.

     Carrie Lee of Washington and Pamila Lew of Ohio, assigned to
Korea, and Dinah Hall of California, who went to Japan, said they
came away more enlightened about the United States and those
countries and about the relationships between the countries.

     Holly Randolph of California, Maribel Mojica of Puerto Rico,
Marcia Chamberlain of Virginia and Bert Gardner of North Carolina
all spoke of what they learned from the poor in Latin America.

     Children in South Africa taught Laura Butterbaugh of Illinois
about faith.  She recounted a story about trying to work with a
family of 10 orphaned children--who had seen their parents
killed--and not finding anything to interest them again in life.
Singing Christian songs helped the children to revive with joy.

     "I realized how much strength they got from Jesus and Jesus'
teaching," she said.

[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF BEGINS A NEW YEAR

LWR BOARD REORGANIZING FOR A NEW YEAR             1/17/92

     At the January 13-14 meeting of the LWR board, elections were held.
Robert Marshall (ELCA) was re-elected as president, Will L. Herzfeld (ELCA)
as vice-president, Norman D. Sell (LCMS) as secretary, and Walter Jensen as
treasurer.  Charles Lutz (ELCA) and Will L. Herzfeld (ELCA) were re-elected
unanimously to their positions on the board.  The Reverend Richard L.
Krenzke (LCMS) was elected as a Director replacing Dr. Eugene Linse (LCMS)
upon Linse's retirement from the board, which was announced this week.

     The Reverend Krenzke comes to the LWR board with various talents.
Educated at the University of Chicago, School of Social Service
Administration and Concordia Theological Seminary from which he was
ordained into the ministry of LCMS, Krenzke has spent the subsequent years
working in ways that best utilize his combined talents.  Recently elected
executive director of the LCMS board for Social Ministry Services, Krenzke
will assume his position on the LWR board with an April orientation and
then a June board meeting and retreat to be held in Seattle, Washington.

     "The best pan-Lutheran agency in America" were the words Eugene W.
Linse (LCMS) used to describe LWR in his closing comments to the board upon
his retirement from that body.  Linse has served the board since December
1982 as one of the 4 LCMS representatives.  LWR is thankful for his service
and appreciated his guidance in establishing and monitoring LWR's adherence
to by-laws and policy.

[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF CALLS CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE PUZZLING

LWR RESPONDS TO NEW CHALLENGES                    1/17/92

  Lutheran World Relief executive director Dr. Norman E. Barth in his
annual report to the board described the whirlwind of events in Eastern
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States and the subsequent public
response and relief efforts as "a puzzlement."  He said storage and
distribution of relief supplies are difficult, as is targeting the needy in
those areas.

      Cognizant of the priority on the "poorest of the poor" that LWR has
always upheld, a decision has been carefully made.  LWR's focus will not be
diminished but some response to the call for aid in Eastern Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States will be initiated.  A $20,000 grant to
Lutheran World Federation (LWF) was announced by Barth informing the Board
that part of it has already been used to transport 20 tons of food and
clothes to Yugoslavia.  This represents an initial contribution to LWR's
recently established Eastern European Fund.  Individuals may contribute to
this fund.

      Barth also reported that the impact of the first peace in Ethiopia
and Eritrea in 30 years is widening but that much rehabilitative work
remains to be done in the area.  In the past year, LWR completed delivery
to Eritrea and Tigray of more than 150,000 MT of food provided by US A.I.D.
Approximately 800,000 people were sustained during 1991 with this food.
Through the Emergency Relief Desk in Ethiopia and its newly opened office
in Asmara, LWR will continue to monitor the rehabilitative work in this
area but will not be so deeply involved in food aid in the future.

     An LWR partner agency in Nicaragua heralded for its work on peace and
reconciliation, a focus of LWR's, was highlighted by Dr.  Barth.  CEPAD
(Evangelical Committee for Development in Nicaragua) has trained more than
50 local ecumenical peace missions.  Respected by both parties in the
conflict-ridden areas of Nicaragua, these missions are able to mediate
satisfactory resolutions, especially concerning land rights.

[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF ASSESSES USA GOVERNMENT ATTITUDES
TOWARDS NEEDS IN EASTERN EUROPE, HORN OF AFRICA; OTHER AREAS NOTED

LWR WASHINGTON STAFF TELL THE STORY               1/17/92

     U.S. government aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States has not
come at the expense of poorer countries, said Carol Capps, representative
for development policy for Church World Service and Witness/Lutheran World
Relief.  Ms. Capps, reporting to the board of directors of Lutheran World
Relief, said that while third world needs have never been a high priority
in Congress, the U.S. government appears to realize that the magnitude of
suffering in the republics of the former Soviet Union is on a different
scale than that in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.

     Ms. Capps also reported on U.S. policy toward the Horn of Africa,
noting that the international community appears paralyzed by the violence
in Somalia, which continues to destroy lives and property.  Governments and
humanitarian agencies have found it difficult to operate in the country, as
anarchy set in after the fall last year of President Siad Barre.  In
neighboring Ethiopia, the U.S. has been slow to provide development aid due
to overdue repayments on military loans dating to the time of Haile
Selassie, in the early 1970s.  Congressional action which would permit
development aid to the new government of Ethiopia failed when an overall
foreign aid bill was not passed in November.  The executive branch could
permit such development aid and is currently going through the steps
necessary to effect a waiver of the Congressional prohibition (Brooke
amendment) of such development aid.

     Ms. Capps introduced Paul Nelson who gave an update on U.S. policy
relating to African recovery and development.  Mr. Nelson and his wife
Paola Scommegna recently joined the Washington staff in policy analysis and
communications.

     In addition to the report from Ms. Capps, the board heard reports from:

     board member Bishop Harold Skillrud of Atlanta on his
     board- mandated monitoring trip to East Africa.
     Describing the "exquisite beauty, grinding poverty and
     concentrated joy" he found in Kenya, Tanzania and
     Zimbabwe, he commended the dedication of LWR staff and
     partners in working to ease human suffering.  In an
     accompanying slide show, Skillrud showed slides of a
     Tanzanian woman who, ten years ago, lived in a small
     home made of bark and thatch.  Thanks to a grant of an
     in-calf heifer, the woman has managed to raise a small
     herd of cattle, increasing the nutrition level of her
     family, and building a brick home with a tin roof.  She
     also has passed on the gift of her heifer to others so
     that they may benefit.

     board member Charles Lutz of Minneapolis.  Lutz
     reported on his trip to monitor LWR work in Israeli
     Occupied Territories, saying the Gaza Strip was "the
     most depressing place on earth, with a feeling of
     gloom."  With Israelis and Palestinians currently in
     negotiations, Lutz found guarded hope among Palestinian
     contacts for the prospects of peace.

     the president of the board.  Robert Marshall encouraged
     board members who are so inclined to write their
     representatives and urge them to make the 10 billion
     dollar loan guarantee that Israel is requesting
     contingent on certain criteria; namely, that there be a
     moratorium on all Israeli settlement-building, that the
     peace process not be disrupted and that human rights
     abuses be decreased.

     the board members on the Middle East.  A "sense of the
     board" was adopted without objection where by it was
     agreed that LWR would not join in any letter advocating
     the passage of the $10 billion loan guarantee to Israel
     without "iron-clad assurances of a freeze on all
     Israeli settlement-building in the occupied
     territories.

     LWR staff on its trial period of direct mail.  Working
     with representatives of the Lutheran Church-Missouri
     Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
     LWR has recently initiated a direct mail appeal program
     corresponding only with individuals who have given
     directly to LWR in the past.  To date, LWR has spent
     less than 8 cents to raise each dollar under the direct
     mail program.  With an overall response rate of 9.5%,
     LWR is encouraged by the results.

     Middle East and Asia Program Director.  In his
     presentation to the LWR board, the Reverend Gene
     Thiemann, donned a gas mask to make two points.  With a
     voice muffled by the mask, he talked first about the
     LWR funds that were used to purchase gas masks for the
     Augusta Victoria Hospital staff in Jerusalem when the
     Persian Gulf war raged. Second, Thiemann talked about
     the need to really listen to the voices that get
     muffled by warfare, natural disaster and civil strife.
     He challenged LWR to amplify and clarify the voices of
     the poor.

DELEGATION ACCOMPANIES SALVADORAN BISHOP HOME
90-1-1-FI

     CHICAGO (ELCA) - The Rev. Medardo Gomez, bishop of the
Lutheran Church of El Salvador, plans to return to El Salvador
from exile in Guatemala to celebrate the Feast of Epiphany, Jan.
6-8.  An ecumenical delegation, including the vice president and
three bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, is
accompanying Gomez in El Salvador to ensure his safety.
     Gomez intends to enter San Salvador Jan. 6 to hold an
Epiphany service at Resurrection Lutheran Church, where he is the
pastor.  He will also participate in worship at the Roman
Catholic Cathedral with Archbishop Rivera y Damas and in an
ecumenical service at the Oscar Romero chapel at the Central
American University.
     ELCA Vice President Christine Grumm of San Francisco, Bishop
David C. Wold of the  Southwestern Washington Synod, Bishop Peter
Rogness of the Greater Milwaukee Synod and Bishop Wayne E.
Weissenbuehler of the Rocky Mountain Synod are included in the
delegation escorting Gomez in his homeland.
     The ELCA selected several delegation members, said the Rev.
James E. Henneberger, area secretary for Latin America in the
ELCA Division for Global Mission.  "Some had been there before.
They are people we feel are astute enough to be objective but
also to be sensitive to the subtleties of what they see and
hear."
     Gomez had asked the ELCA and the Salvadoran Humanitarian
Aid, Research and Education Foundation of Washington, D. C., to
organize the ecumenical delegation.  SHARE is a non-profit
organization founded in 1981 to provide aid to refugees and
displaced people in El Salvador.
     Henneberger expressed plans for the ELCA, through his
office, to organize ecumenical delegations on a regular basis to
visit El Salvador.
     Death threats against Gomez and accusations that he
participated in "subversive military activities" prompted him to
leave El Salvador Nov. 25.  He set up offices in Guatemala City,
Guatemala, and indicated his intention to return to his country
as soon as possible.
     Gomez has accused "the armed forces of El Salvador" of
several acts of oppression against the Lutheran, Roman Catholic,
Episcopal, Baptist and Mennonite churches, as well as the
Ecumenical Coordination of Churches there.  Lutheran church
workers have been arrested, searched, threatened and deported.
     Other members of the delegation are Episcopal Bishop Roger
White of Milwaukee; Eileen Purcell, executive director of SHARE;
the Rev. Gustav Schultz, of Berkeley, Calif., an ELCA pastor and
president of the SHARE Foundation; the Rev. Arthur F. McGovern, a
Jesuit priest and professor of philosophy at the University of
Detroit; the Rev. Robert McAfee Brown, a Presbyterian theologian
from the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif.; the Rev.
Miguel Palacios of the Episcopal Diocese of Guatemala City; Eric
Popkin, Wisconsin Council of Churches; and Mary Beth Murphy, a
reporter for the Milwaukee Sentinel.

STUDENTS DISCUSS FAITH AND SCIENCE
90-1-2-DM

     ST. LOUIS (ELCA) -- Nearly 300 Lutheran college students
welcomed in the last decade of a century that has been marked by
a revolution in high technology with a conference on issues of
faith and science.
     The students came here from about 80 different universities
for a conference held Dec. 28-Jan. 1.  The conference "Stewards
of Technology Responding to God's Call,"  was sponsored by the
Lutheran Student Movement-USA.
     "The most important thing we can do is bring the Christian
value of cooperation into our communities...that will do more for
technology than all the high technology we can use," said keynote
speaker Dr. Rustum Roy, a leading U.S. materials scientist
involved in the first Vatican and National Council of Churches
discussions of science and religion.
     "Don't attack anybody, just go ask everybody a lot of
questions in a Woody Allen fashion," he said.  Roy is professor
of the solid state and professor of geochemistry at Pennsylvania
State University, University Park, PA.  He also serves as
director of the university's Science, Technology and Society
Program.
     "Newness is the principal character of godliness and chance
is its principal agent on earth," said Roy in calling students to
"prayerful, thoughtful, careful experimenting with life."
     "Rippling through the whole scheme is a magnificent,
glorious, unifying and loving experience that we in the West have
called God," said a second keynote speaker, Dr. George K.
Schweitzer, alumni distinguished professor of chemistry at the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
     "I do not know how love expresses him or herself out there
in the universe," he said.  "I do know God is and has been
communicating everywhere."
     In plenary action, students passed resolutions in favor of
conserving water, being accepting of non-Christians and combating
racism.  They narrowly defeated a resolution supporting the
humane use of animals in biomedical research and testing.
     Students attended workshops and worship services which
centered on faith and science issues.  They also visited the zoo
and botanical gardens in St. Louis.
     "We are the future leaders of our churches, and by exposing
us now to the problems of tomorrow it starts our minds turning,"
said Bill Neumyer of Palmyra, Pa., who was elected LSM president
for 1990.  Newmyer is beginning graduate work in nuclear
engineering at the University of Tennessee.  He is a recent
graduate from Penn State.
     The Lutheran Student Movement-USA is a pan-Lutheran student
group with members from several U.S. Lutheran denominations.  Its
annual conference is provided with major financial and staff
support from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

LIRS RECEIVES CONGRESSIONAL TRIBUTE
90-1-3-BB

     WASHINGTON -- Ten members of the U.S. Congress paid tribute
to Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service in remarks made in
the Senate and House at the start of LIRS's yearlong 50th
anniversary observance.
     Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who chairs the subcommittee
on immigration and refugee affairs in the Senate, said LIRS was a
"phenomenal humanitarian agency.
     "LIRS has made the difference between lives of oppression
and deprivation and lives of hope and freedom for over 150,000
refugees from throughout the world," he said.
     Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., who chairs the House
subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law,
commended LIRS for "its efforts in organizing assistance for
children who are being kept in detention centers because of their
lack of legal status in this country."
     "While the LIRS does not seek recognition for its
humanitarian efforts, I rise today to commend them," said Sen.
Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.  "With the world's refugee population
estimated at 14 million, the work of organizations such as the
LIRS assumes an ever-increasing significance."
     Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., called LIRS "a vibrant organization
for 50 years."
     Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said the more than 6,000
congregational sponsors that have joined LIRS in the resettlement
process, "also deserve praise for their untiring work in
accepting newcomers.  As the only refugee serving in the U.S.
Senate, I have a deep concern for the plight of refugees and
immigrants.  I have worked closely with LIRS in the past and look
forward to a continued close working relationship."  Boschwitz is
a member of LIRS's honorary 50th anniversary committee.
     Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said "It is the private
voluntary organizations like LIRS which are truly on the front
lines of refugee policy.  On both the local and international
level, private voluntary organizations help governments grapple
with the growing refugee problem."
     Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., noted the involvement of
LIRS "in efforts to chart a more humane immigration and refugee
policy within the United States and among the nations of the
world."
     Rep. Thomas E. Petri, R-Wis., pointed out that LIRS is "one
of just two voluntary agencies that resettles unaccompanied
minors."  LIRS has placed more than 3,000 unaccompanied refugee
children in foster care since 1978.
     Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass., said that in Massachusetts
"the work of LIRS is well known and has added to the very fabric
of our life as a commonwealth."
     "The work of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service makes
Christ's words manifest and is a shining beacon of hope in a
world in which the lack of human compassion sometimes seems
overwhelming," Christ said that as you have done to the least of
these you have also done it unto me, said Rep. Timothy P.
Johnson, D-S.D.
     LIRS serves on behalf of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and Latvian Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America.  "Opening Doors" is the theme of its
anniversary observance which will continue until next fall.

Commentary: Religion as prophet to politics
RNS>17230

By A. James Rudin
Special to Religious News Service

   (Rabbi Rudin is national interreligious affairs director of the
American Jewish Committee.)

   (RNS) -- What in American life has historically played a key role
in shaping fundamental values of political leaders?
   Look for the answer in the early minutes of an upcoming television
program called "Democracy in America," an in-depth look at the lives
of Sen. Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Appearing briefly during the Markle Foundation-produced broadcast,
to be aired Oct. 11 on CNN, is the Missionary Baptist Church in
Carthage, Tenn., where Gore's spiritual life is rooted. It is the
church where his grandparents worshiped.
   And then, during a segment on Quayle, he says that "church on
Sunday" was a part of his upbringing in Huntington, Ind.
   These are but two examples of many in history that highlight the
strong influence of religion on our political process. It was an
aspect of the American scene that astonished French historical Alexis
de Tocqueville when he wrote a book called "Democracy in America" more
than a century ago.
   The connections have continued to amaze foreign visitors. The
United States is a highly industrialized First World country that
behaves religiously like a Third World nation. We have a legal barrier
between religion and government. Even though there is a legal
separation between religion and state, religion has been a critical,
often defining, factor in shaping the values of our political leaders.
   Throughout history, religious groups have stressed moral dimensions
of public issues, giving urgency and passion to politics. When leaders
sought independence from Great Britain, the cause was preached in
colonial pulpits.
   The abolitionist and pro-slavery movements were strongly supported
by religious leaders before the Civil War. And in this century, such
movements as prohibition, civil rights, sexual equality, the various
anti-war efforts and yes, family values, have all found a home in
church and synagogue.
   Religion's deep hold on the political imagination of most Americans
sets our country apart from others. High visibility at religious
services has traditionally been part of a U.S. president's job
description.
   Some consider the close ties a threat to the American republic. In
fact, they may be more a threat to religion. Many American political
leaders have abused religious symbols and language. And worse, they
have at times appropriated divine approval for ideology of their own
political parties.
   In the heat of a presidential election, it is important to remember
that God is neither a Republican nor a Democrat, not even an
independent.
   It is also important to recognize religion's proper functions in
society. One role, of course, is to develop permanent ethical values
in future leaders. Are the churches doing their job well? If Gore or
Quayle eventually becomes president, as five of our last nine vice
presidents have done, we may all learn the answer.
   But religion plays another important role in the political process:
to play the biblical prophet Nathan to King David, to be the
conscience of political leaders.
   Too often Jews and Christians have forgotten Nathan, who confronted
David with the seriousness of a moral lapse, and identified with the
dominant political values of society. Too often religion has been
deliberately manipulated by political leaders for their own ends.
   Writing 200 years ago, James Madison envisioned a robust role for
religion. He called for a "multiplicity of sects" in the public arena,
the better to achieve a balance between the compelling demands of
authentic religion and the complex political process.
   Each time we elect national leaders we are striking a new balance
for the future. It is an awesome but a necessary task.

Editor sues for wider access to Dead Sea Scrolls
RNS>17231

By David E. Anderson
Religious News Service
      (RNS) -- Herschel Shanks, the American editor who broke open a
fraternity of Dead Sea scholars to ensure wider access to the scrolls,
has gone to court to defend that access.
   Shanks, and the organization he heads, the Biblical Archaeology
Society, have filed suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia
against Israeli professor Elisha Quimron. The suit, filed Sept. 25,
seeks a declaration from the court that a part of the Scrolls
reconstructed by Quimron cannot be copyrighted.
   Quimron, a professor of Hebrew Language at Ben-Gurion University in
Israel, is currently a scholar in residence at the Annenberg Research
Institute in Philadelphia.
   Some eight months ago, Quimron successfully sought a temporary
injunction barring the society from publishing or distributing
anywhere in the world the two-volume book "A Facsimile Edition of the
Dead Sea Scrolls."
   The book, which contains an introduction by Shanks, was the result
of years of labor by him and others to break the hold a small group of
scholars has held on the scrolls since they were discovered in 1947 in
a cave in what is now Israel. Shanks' effort was intended to make the
documents more available to other researchers and the public.
   The documents are believed to have been written between 200 years
before and 50 years after the birth of Jesus.
   The ancient texts represent one of the most important manuscript
discoveries in the field of early rabbinic Judaism and the first years
of the Christian movement. The originals are kept at the Rockefeller
Museum in Jerusalem and research on them is done under the auspices of
the Israeli Antiquities Authority.
   Since the 1950s, a small group of scholars, now numbering just 15,
has controlled exclusive publishing rights to the scrolls and less
than half have been published.
   Last year, the Biblical Archaeology Society published its two-
volume work containing more than 1,750 photographic plates. The book
made the text of the scrolls widely available to scholars, researchers
and other interested parties.
   Part of the volumes included a 120-line portion of the
reconstructed text of an ancient document known as MMT, an acronym for
the Hebrew phrase "Miqsat Ma'aseh ha-Torah."
   The MMT text is believed to a foundation document of the Qumran
sect, a Jewish group that broke with the prevailing rabbinic Judaism.
   Although the text, amounting to about 120 lines in Quimron's
reconstruction, is 2000 years old, the Israeli scholar, who is
preparing the reconstructed text for publication, says he owns the
copyright on it. Publication in the society's two-voume work is an
infringement of that copyright, he contends.
   Shanks said that the Israeli court's injunction, if allowed to
stand, "would have very broad implications for all scholarship."
   "It's probably the first time where a scholar has claimed such a
copyright on an ancient text," he said in an interview with Religious
News Service.
   Shanks went on to note that the reconstructed Hebrew transcript of
the text, as pubished in the facsimile, is already in wide
circulation.
   "Virtually all scholars have this text," he said. "Classes have
been taught on it. He (Quimron) authorized numerous articles" on it.
In 1990, a Polish journal, "The Qumran Chronicle," published a 120-
line text of MMT.
   In the complaint filed in Philadelphia, Shanks compared the
reconstruction of the MMT text to the completion of a jigsaw puzzle.
The complaint said that "much, if not all," of the work of
reconstructing MMT has been completed by scholars other than Quimron.
He became involved in preparing MMT for publication only in 1980,
according to Shanks.
   When the reconstructed text is made available for study by scholars
it is expected to shed a great deal of light on the Qumran sect,
including its beliefs, religious laws and practices and the then-
prevailing practices of Judaism.
   Shanks and the archaeology society are asking the court to declare
that publishing a portion of the MMT did not infringe any copyright in
violation of Quimron's rights.
   Quimron has until mid-October to reply to the complaint.

Q&A: Answers to questions about religion
RNS>17232

By Religious News Service

   (Editor's note: The following is a weekly feature from RNS. See
note at the end, which invites reader participation.)


Color it ?

Q: What is the significance of the colors of vestments worn by
Catholic priests and some Protestant ministers when they preside over
a worship service?

A: Violet or purple symbolizes penitence and is used during the
two major penitential seasons of the church's liturgical year. Those
are Advent, leading up to Christmas, and Lent, leading up to Easter.
   Rose, which symbolizes joy during a period of penance, is worn on a
specific Sundays during each of those seasons.
   Red symbolizes the suffering, or passion, of Jesus Christ on the
cross, and is worn for services that recall it. They include Passion
Sunday (also called Palm Sunday) and Good Friday. Red is also worn on
Pentecost, the major feast associated with the Holy Spirit, and for
celebrations of the feasts of apostles and martyrs.
   White, symbolizing purity, is worn for holidays associated with
Christ, such as Christmas and Easter; for feasts commemorating the
Virgin Mary or saints who are not martyrs. White may also be worn for
funerals.
   Green, symbolizing hope and vitality of faith, is worn for
"ordinary time," those Sundays that do not fall into other categories.
   Liturgical colors were standardized by the Council of Trent in the
16th century. Before that, the use of colors varied from place to
place.
   In efforts to set themselves apart from Catholics, most Protestants
abandoned use of color in services during the Reformation. But many
have begun using it again in recent times.


Biblical wings

Q: How many birds are mentioned in the Bible?

A: About 50, far fewer than the 350 species known to inhabit
biblical lands. Leviticus 11:19 alone mentions more than a dozen,
including the eagle, vulture, osprey, buzzard, raven, ostrich, hawk,
sea gull, owl, water hen, stork, heron and hoopoe. The list identifies
birds of prey that are to be avoided because they are considered
"unclean."
   Of these, the least well-known on the list, the hoopoe, is a 12-
inch-long bird with a long, curving beak and hawking call. It has a
cinnamon or buff-colored body and a high, gold crest tipped with
black. Its back and wings are marked with black and white bands.
   The hoopoe, common in Africa and Eruope, forages for insects and
worms in manure piles, which accounts for its being labeled unfit to
eat.

   Readers are invited to submit questions about religion or
religious practices to: Questions, Religious News Service, P.O. Box
1015, Radio City Station, New York, N.Y. 10101.

Archbishop Roach scolds newspaper for series
RNS>17233

By Willmar Thorkelson
RNS Correspondent
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (RNS) -- Archbishop John R. Roach of the
Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis has denounced the St. Paul
Pioneer Press for publishing excerpts from a book dealing with priests
and the sexual abuse of children.
   Among other cases, the book, "Lead Us Not Into Temptation" by Jason
Berry, recounts how the archdiocese and another Minnesota diocese
assigned the Rev. Thomas Adamson, an accused pedophile, to various
parishes despite reports he had abused boys.
   In a guest column in the St. Paul newspaper on Thursday, Roach said
the Berry excerpts, published as a series, raise "serious questions
about fairness and good journalistic practice."
   The information about Adamson "was simply a rehash of matters that
have been public and published by you," he said, in what amounted to
an open letter to the newspaper.
   "Media throughout the country, including the Pioneer Press, and
professionals in the field of sexual abuse have recognized that the
Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis has been a leader in
correcting what we have admitted were serious flaws in the way we
addressed pedophilia cases several years ago," Roach wrote. "We
operated from ignorance, and we have paid the price.
   "More importantly, we have learned, and we have been called upon by
interfaith groups and others all across the country to share our
policies," which were published in the Pioneer Press in 1988, he said.
   He continued: "Your knowledge of that and your failure to strike a
balance by noting it in connection with this series raises questions
about fairness, and perhaps indicates bias."
   Roach said he had "resisted vigorously" the notion that Catholics
are victims of a biased media. Howver, he said, "the decision to run
this series gives considerable credence to the theory of prejudice and
bias.
   "This archdiocese has been a vital part of this community from its
very beginning. We have been responsible citizens and have a long
history of successful service to the community. We have been here
longer than the Pioneer Press, and we will be here after the Pioneer
Press.
   "As you know, over the years we have had meetings with the editors
of your paper to discuss a variety of issues. We work hard to be
cooperative with the local media.
   "If your intent was to embarrass us, you've done it. But the way in
which you did it says more about you than about us."

Catholic leader targets entertainment industry
RNS>17234

By David E. Anderson
Religious News Service
      (RNS) -- Cardinal Roger Mahony, head of the archdiocese of Los
Angeles, issued an unprecedented pastoral letter to the entertainment
industry on Wednesday, telling artists they have a moral obligation to
uphold "human values" but rejecting any censorship or production code.
   "Because I reject censorship, I do not propose a code to govern
what filmmakers may create, nor do I wish to dictate what intelligent
viewers may see," Mahony wrote in the 40-page letter. It was timed to
mark the fifth anniversary of Pope John Paul II's meeting with leaders
of the movie, television and recording industries during his trip to
the United States in 1987.
   While saying filmmakers are "rightly jealous" of their creative
freedom, the cardinal added: "But a moment's reflection will convince
them that the freedom they cherish cannot be separated from the moral
order, the demands of truth, a concern for the common good or the
well-being of other people.
   "Such a separation would result not in freedom, but in license."
   Mahony said he wrote the letter because Los Angeles is the
entertainment capital of the world, an area where "a great proportion
of the world's entertainment is conceived, financed and produced."
   "But I also write for our Catholic community and for all people of
goodwill across the nation who are viewers of these efforts," he said.
   The letter comes in the midst of an intense campaign year debate
over "family values," a term Mahony avoided, using "human" instead,
and an on-going attack on Hollywood by Vice President Dan Quayle and
leaders of the Religious Right.
   Mahony, however, has rejected the more extreme of those views.
Earlier this year, he quickly disavowed a statement from the
archdiocesan office, which said that he would call for a tough new
film rating code. It was being proposed by the Atlanta-based Christian
Film and Television Commission.
   In preparing the letter, Mahony met with several leaders of the
industry. They included Lew Wasserman, chairman of MCA Inc., parent of
Universal Pictures, as well as the heads of the Writers Guild of
America West and the Directors Guild of America.
   In the letter Mahony posed a series of guidelines filmmakers and
other entertainers should apply to themselves, including avoiding
sexist portrayals of women. He noted especially that the responsible
filmmaker's task is made difficult by the fact that so much of the
audience is made up of "young people who are not yet emotionally
mature."
   "Given the power of film, what might be a tasteful and realistic
portrayal of a significant human experience for a disciplined and
mature adult, can result, for sensitive and vulnerable young people,
in self-destructive, anti-social behavior," he said.
   "The Golden Rule applies here," he added. "Responsible filmmakers
will not do to their audience what they would not done to themselves
or to their own teen-age sons and daughters," he said.
   The letter was greeted by industry officials with relief and
praise.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, called the Mahony letter "wise and thoughtful." Danny
Goldberg, president of Atlantic Records and chairman of the American
Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California, told the Los
Angeles Times he was "impressed" and "moved" by the letter.
   "It speaks to the kind of relationship that artists should have
with religion," he said.
   On religion, Mahony noted that the "overhelming majority of
American people believe in God and pray regularly. They look to God to
give meaning to their lives."
   The responsible filmmaker, he said, should ask, "Is the religious
dimension of the characters in their story in evidence. If not, why
not?"
   He also challenged filmmakers to upgrade their portrayal of women.
"Are they persons possessing the same intrinsic dignity as their male
counterparts and, at the deepest level, facing the same soul-wrenching
challenges to grow? ... Or is the impression given that they are
somehow something less, valued as objects rather than the persons they
are."
   In urging that "human values" be reflected, Mahony said such values
"are not the exclusive property of any one religious community, ethnic
group, educational level, economic class or political party."
   "To the filmmakers of our community, I say: Make films which
reflect these kinds of values and you actualize what is deepest,
richest and most creative within you. By doing so, you will give
something very special to your audiences. I can think of no better way
for you to say `thank you' for the superlative talents you have been
given by God."

Pastor resigns prominent Baptist pulpit
RNS>17235

By Jim Jones
Speical to Religious News Service
   DALLAS (RNS) -- A minister hired to be pastor of one of the largest
congregations in the Southern Baptist Convention resigned abruptly
Wednesday night, claiming the legendary senior pastor, the Rev. W.A.
Criswell, was reluctant to give up leadership.
   The Rev. Joel Gregory, named to succeed Criswell in November 1990
at 28,000-member First Baptist Church here, stunned members attending
a Wednesday prayer service when he read a resignation statement. In
the statement he charged that some church leaders were trying to
prolong Criswell's ministry at Gregory's expense.
   "The ultimate agenda," he said, "is in the prolongation of the
incumbent's ministry rather than enabling the new pastor's."
   Gregory, 44, said he considered his resignation to be irrevocable
and effective immediately.
   Gregory acknowledged that a short "transition period" had been
agreed upon when he accepted the prestigious post. At the time he was
hired, the arrangement was for Criswell to continue preaching at the
church's 11 a.m. Sunday service, while Gregory would preach at the
church's other three weekly services. Criswell, 82, was just the
second pastor of the church, founded in 1898.
   However, in the interview Gregory said he had recently learned that
some congregational leaders were expressing hopes that Criswell, a
former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, would remain as
senior pastor until his 50th anniversary at the church, still two
years away.
   "There was a verbal agreement that this was a short-term
transition," said Gregory. "I didn't anticipate it to be 20 months. I
certainly didn't anticipate it to be four years."
   Gregory, 44, said he had been told originally that Criswell would
step down as senior pastor after only a few months, possibly by the
spring of 1991.
   Gregory, a noted preacher in the 15-million-member denomination,
said, "The decision had elements of pain, but it also had elements of
integrity and rightness. I feel a verbal understanding among
Christians ought to be honored."
   Before accepting the pastorate, Gregory noted, he had been warned
by many fellow pastors that it would be impossible to be the true
pastor of First Baptist as long as Criswell remained in the pulpit.
   "I was told by many people, and, you know, they were right," said
Gregory.
   Asked about his plans, Gregory said, "I plan to rest and read. That
congregation is a huge burden, a day and night responsibility. I'll
rest awhile and see what opens up."
   Gregory said he had approached some congregational leaders about
the problem in recent weeks and was told he should bring his concerns
directly to Criswell.
   But in his statement he said he had decided that option would not
be appropriate.
   Despite the situation, Gregory said, he bears no animosity toward
Criswell, who was on the platform with Gregory when he made his
announcement.
   Criswell made no statement at the Wednesday service, and a
spokesman at First Baptist said Thursday afternoon that Criswell was
unavailable for comment on the matter.

   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)

   The Rev. Morris Chapman, president of the executive committee of
the Southern Baptist Convention, said he was aware of the struggles
within the Dallas church but had no idea they would result in a
resignation.
   "Things were not going real easily in the church," Chapman said
from executive committee headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. "It was just
a time of transition which was not going smoothly."
   "Dr. Criswell has given great leadership to the church over the
years," said Chapman. "Dr. Gregory is one of the premier preachers in
the Southern Baptist Convention."
   Up until 1990, Gregory had not been publicly identified with either
the denomination's moderate factions or its fundamentalists, who over
the past decade have come to dominate most of the denomination's
boards and commissions.
   But that year, when it seemed a moderate could be elected president
of the denomination, Gregory joined with several other prominent
pastors to endorse Chapman, the more conservative candidate.
   At that time, he said he hoped to "demonstrate that the
conservative resurgence in the convention is not simply a punitive
political plot to transfer power to one group" and said he hoped "to
be able to call all our people together who affirm the Bible as the
perfect work of God."

NEWS ON THE TAX FRONT

     Legislative update.  At this time Congress and the President
are still at loggerheads.  The jam could be broken at any time,
or could outlast the spring thaw.  It does appear that much of
the reform bill is vulnerable to change.
     Most prizes and awards are taxable income.  In Yarbrough
Oldsmobile Cadillac, Inc. (T.C. Memo. 1995-538) the Court held
trips received by the taxpayer from an auto manufacturer were
taxable income to the company president.  In addition, the Court
found that two boats were the property of the president and
shareholder, even though the corporation held title to the boats.
The president was the only person to use the boats.
     In an audit of regular corporations, agents often claim an
officer-shareholder's compensation is unreasonable.  Any amount
disallowed is treated as a nondeductible dividend.  In  Guy
Schoenecker, Inc., (T.C. Memo. 1995-539) the Court sided with the
IRS in finding the president's salary to be excessive.  The Court
noted that the president set his compensation based on what he
wanted to take out of the company, and not what would have been
paid in an arm's-length transaction.  The fact that the president
decreased the bonus of one employee while increasing his own
weighed against him.
     In Announcement 95-98 (I.R.B. 1995-47, 19) the IRS announced
that the expiration date on the 1992 revision of Form 3115,
Application for Change in Accounting Method has been extended to
August 31, 1998.
     The strong bond market is benefiting taxpayers who owe
interest on underpayment penalties.  In Internal Revenue News
Release IR-95-96 the Service announced that the interest rates
for the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 1996 will remain at
8% for overpayments, 9% for underpayments, and 11% for large
corporate underpayments.
     In Announcement 95-99 (I.R.B. 1995-48) the IRS released
examination guidelines for employee plan examiners to use when
examining plans for compliance with certain distribution
requirements and for the application of the limitation on
benefits.
     When incorporating a new business you can avoid a taxable
transaction by contributing assets to the corporation in exchange
for stock (Sec. 351).  However, the corporation's basis in the
assets acquired are generally equal to the transferor's basis.
In George Georgiou and Judith Georgiou, (T.C. Memo. 1995-546) the
Court held that inventories the taxpayer transferred to a new
corporation had to be valued at the taxpayer's basis.  He could
not value the assets at their fair market value.
     You can only deduct living expenses while away from home if
the job assignment is temporary.  Generally, that means less than
a year.  In Gary M. and Trudy J. Weichlein (T.C. Memo. 1995-553)
the taxpayer had no prospect of finding work near her home and
worked at a series of jobs away from home, all for the same
employer.  The Court denied her traveling expenses.
     There are a number of similarities between partnerships and
S corporations in the way they are taxed.  But there are a number
of differences.  A shareholder's income from an S corporation can
consist of salary and the passthrough of income, but none of the
income qualifies as self-employment income.  That's what the
Court held in Antonio R. Durando (95-2 USTC 50,615).  Since the
taxpayer had no self-employment income, he could not make
contributions to a Keogh plan.
     Rev. Proc. 95-51 (I.R.B. 1995-51) provides approval to
change the funding method used to determine the minimum funding
standard for defined benefit plans under Code Sec. 412.
     In Internal Revenue News Release IR-95-68 the IRS announced
that most taxpayers will be able to have their IRS refunds
deposited directly to their checking or savings accounts when
filing their 1995 returns.  You must include the necessary bank
information on Form 8888 (Direct Deposit of Refund) and attach
the form to your return.
     Because pending legislation would affect Forms W-4, W-4P and
W-4S, in Announcement 95-104 (I.R.B. 1995-51), the IRS is asking
taxpayers to continue using 1995 forms until the 1996 revisions
are available.  However, Form W-5 (Earned Income Credit Advance
Payment Certificate) is being revised and the new form must be
used beginning in 1996.  Some filers of this form may no longer
be eligible for the credit.
     Direct sellers are not considered employees for withholding
tax purposes. In Letter Ruling 9530001 the Service held that
persons who worked as canvassers and closers who went door to
door selling home improvement and repair services were direct
sellers and not employees.  The workers were held to be in the
trade or business of selling consumer products in the home or
other than in a permanent retail establishment.  Substantially
all of the workers' remuneration was related to sales or other
output rather than the number of hours worked.  In addition, the
workers perform their services pursuant to a written agreement
that provides that the workers will not be treated as employees
for federal tax purposes.
     Many small business owners operate more than one business,
sometimes through separate entities.  In Letter Ruling 9530005
the taxpayer performed work for his S corporation and had
consulting income he reported on Schedule C.  The IRS held that
the taxpayer was a corporate officer who performed significant
services which were held to be wages subject to FICA and FUTA
taxes and income tax withholding.  Moreover, he could not net the
losses from S corporations with income from self-employment for
purposes of calculating the self-employment (SECA) tax.

BUSINESS TAXES--INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS

     You own two corporations.  Madison's bank account is
overflowing; Wilton Inc. can't afford to meet this week's
payroll.  Should you just tell your controller to cut the payroll
checks on Madison's bank account?  It depends on all the facts.
However, in some cases it could be very costly move.
     The general rule is that a deduction is only allowed to the
party who both incurs (or is liable for) the expense and makes
the payment.  Let's look at the case of a parent and subsidiary.
Assume you own 100% of Madison Inc.  Madison has a wholly owned
subsidiary, Wilton Inc.  Because Wilton is short of cash, Madison
writes the bonus checks to Wilton's employees on its account.
According to Rev. Rul. 84-68 (1984-1 C.B. 31), Madison can't
deduct the payment.  Instead, Madison records the payment as a
capital contribution to Wilton.  Wilton takes the deduction.
     Generally, the only disadvantage here is some extra
bookkeeping.  Wilton is a subsidiary of Madison, so there's
really no winner or loser from a tax standpoint.
     Now consider a slightly different situation.  Instead of a
parent-subsidiary relationship, you own 100% of both Madison and
Wilton.  Again Madison writes checks for a total of $50,000 to
pay Wilton's employees.  The IRS recharacterizes this as three
separate transactions.  One, Madison paid a $50,000 dividend to
you.  Two, you made a $50,000 capital contribution to Wilton.
Three, Wilton paid a $50,000 bonus.
     The tax effects here are very different.  The dividend is
not deductible by Madison, but is taxable to you.  The capital
contribution has no direct tax effect.  The $50,000 payment is
deductible by Wilton.  Here, again, Wilton gets a $50,000
deduction, but this time you have $50,000 of dividend income.
Keep in mind that there are some subtle tax effects.  For
example, the capital contribution would increase your tax basis
in Wilton should you sell the business.
     Things can get worse in the second example.  What if Wilton
later repaid Madison?  The IRS could recharacterize it as a
$50,000 dividend from Wilton to you followed by a capital
contribution by you to Madison.  The roundtrip of $50,000 has
created $100,000 in income to you.
     What if Madison loaned Wilton the $50,000?  If you can
create a bona fide loan, that should work.  But remember, you
should have a note with a maturity date, collateral, etc.  While
a much better approach, it may not be a sure thing.  The loan
might be recharacterized if Wilton is thinly capitalized or would
not have been able to borrow money from a regular lender.
     What about S corporations?  If both Madison and Wilton are S
corporations, the result may not be as disastrous.  The
distribution from Madison might not be taxable.  Even so, using
the loan approach makes more sense.
     A loan from a regular corporation to an S corporation could
also have adverse consequences.  For example, you own 100% of
Wilton (a regular corporation) and 100% of Madison (an S
corporation).  Wilton loans money to Madison.  The IRS might try
to recharacterize this as an equity contribution by Wilton to
Madison.  You'd get no benefit for the additional capital.
Worse, the S election could be terminated.
     You should also be careful of other transactions.  For
example, Madison produces widgets which it sells to unrelated
customers for $10 each.  Madison also sells them to Wilton, but
for cost, $4 each.  Madison and Wilton are both owned by you.
the IRS might try to recharacterize this transaction.  You could
also have problems if Madison sold the widgets to Wilton for more
than it charges regular customers.  (See Product Discounts,
below.)
     Another point.  In the examples we assumed you own 100% of
both corporations.  That's not necessary.  For example, you could
encounter problems if you and 4 other associates own all the
stock of both entities.
     If you do business through two or more regular corporations,
and there are regular intercompany transactions, talk to your tax
adviser about setting up a parent-subsidiary relationship.  And
keep all dealings on an arms'-length basis.

BUSINESS TAXES--TELEMARKETER-EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR?

     In religion the eternal struggle is good vs. evil.  In the
annals of the IRS it's employee vs. independent contractor.  The
IRS and the courts look at 20 factors when making a
determination.  Some factors may not be appropriate.  However,
one factor present in almost all cases is the degree of control
by the employer.
     Telemarketers were the subject of a recent letter ruling (LR
9527009), but the IRS advice was unchanged from an earlier
revenue ruling (Rev. Rul. 74-333, 1974-2 C.B. 328), so it can
generally be relied upon.
     In the first situation, a company engaged an individual to
perform services as a telephone solicitor to obtain orders.  Her
duties are to telephone certain prospects designated by the
company and to record the necessary information on an order blank
at the time a sale is made.  She is furnished with office
facilities, supplies and a telephone by the company on its
premises.  There is no prescribed period of training; however the
company does furnish a suggested script.  The calls are made at
times optional to the solicitor, but she is expected to devote
from 4 to 8 hours daily to the job.  Her services are performed
under the company's name.  She is paid a commission on each sale
and is not expected to produce a minimum volume of sales.  Her
services may be terminated at any time.
     In this situation, the IRS held the worker was an employee
since the company exercises or has the right to exercise
direction and control over the worker.
     In the second situation, the facts are the same as above,
but the worker operates out of her own home, performs all
services on a part-time basis, without supervision, and pays all
the expenses incurred in connection with her selling activities.
The worker is given a list of names from a telephone directory so
that there is no duplication.  She does not submit reports, other
than sales orders, does not deliver the products or collect
payments, and is not required to devote any certain amount of
time to the work, perform any services on the company's premises,
or produce a minimum volume of sales.
     In this situation the IRS held that the company does not or
can not exercise enough control to call the worker an employee.
Thus, the worker would be classified as an independent
contractor.
     Rev. Rul. 75-242 (1975-1 C.B. 321) presented a slightly
different situation.  The telemarketers worked from home,
furnishing their own phones, under the company's name.  The
company provided the workers with all necessary forms and
stationery.  They were given introductory training and furnished
with a required speech.  The solicitors were required to complete
a daily report listing all calls made and the number of hours
spent performing services.  The company also specified the hours
during the day and the number of days a week that each solicitor
was to perform the services.  The company paid the workers on an
hourly basis.
     Here the IRS held that the worker was an employee because of
the control involved (hours of work required, reports, etc.),
even though the solicitor worked out of his house.
     The letter ruling had a slightly different set of facts.
Workers who performed the services at offices provided by the
company and had to work a certain number of hours were deemed
employees.  Those who either had to or choose to work at home
with no restrictions, were considered independent contractors.
It didn't make any difference that the workers signed a contract
indicating they were independent contractors.
     There's no general answer.  Each situation is different.
There is one way to avoid problems.  Try to modify your business
practices to follow the situation described in the revenue
ruling.  For example, have the person work out of their house (or
own office), make them pay for their own supplies, pay them
solely on commission, etc.

TAXES--DEPRECIATION-ALLOWED OR ALLOWABLE

     When you sell any tangible personal property (e.g.,
machinery, furniture, etc.) used in your business, you may have a
gain or a loss.  The nature (ordinary income or capital gain) and
the amount of the gain or loss will depend on the depreciation
'allowed or allowable'.  Allowed or allowable is a technical
term, but it can be a big trap if you're not careful.
     Basically, allowed or allowable means that you've got to
reduce your basis in the asset by either the amount of
depreciation you took, or the amount you should have taken.
There's the trap.  If you inadvertently don't take depreciation
on an asset, the law assumes you depreciated the asset using the
straight line method, and your basis in the asset will be reduced
accordingly.
     Example--In 1988 Madison Inc. purchased a new machine for
$10,000, but through a bookkeeping error, never took any
depreciation.  In 1996 Madison sells the machine for $4,500.
Since the machine would have been fully depreciated using the
straight line method, Madison's basis is $0 and it will have to
report a gain of $4,500 on the sale.
     The $4,500 gain would be the same if Madison had taken
depreciation, but it would have gotten $10,000 in tax deductions
over the years.
     There's only one possible out.  If you discover the error
before it's too late you might be able to file an amended return
and recover some lost depreciation deductions.  More than likely
you'll only be able to salvage a fraction of what you could have
taken.
     Be sure to record and depreciate all fixed asset additions.
While not as popular as general accounting software, there a
number of programs that make it relatively painless.

BUSINESS TAXES--PRODUCT DISCOUNTS

     Rebates or discounts on products sold to customers or
dealers are always deductible, right?  Don't answer too quickly.
While you'll have no trouble if you've got a standard formula
(e.g., 10% off on purchases over $500, etc.), you could run into
an IRS challenge if you get too tricky.
     In one recent case (Foretravel, Inc.,;1 T.C. Memo. 1995-494)
the taxpayer was a manufacturer of high-end motor coaches.  The
taxpayer sold the motor homes through both independent and
captive (subsidiary) dealerships.  The units had high wholesale
and suggested retail prices (to maintain a top-of-the-line
image), but substantial discounts might have to be made by the
dealer to sell a demo unit, one with an unusual paint scheme,
etc.  Adjustments would also have to be made if a customer was
trading in an used coach made by the taxpayer.  On the other
hand, if the dealer could sell a coach at the full price, it
certainly tried to do so.
     The taxpayer had no written policy for arriving at a
discount.  The company took into account trade-ins, customer
goodwill, the type of customer (a high profile owner such as a
leader of a motor home club might get a bigger discount), etc.
In fact, because the ultimate profit on the sale might not be
known until after the trade-in unit was sold, the rebates were
generally not determined until the end of the year.
     The taxpayer recorded the rebates by crediting accounts
receivable and debiting bad debts.  When preparing the financial
statements, the company's accountants reclassified the rebates.
Unfortunately, because of several oversights, the
reclassification was not reflected on the tax returns.
     The IRS contended that the incentive payments were
contributions to the capital of the dealerships and thus not
deductible.  That argument was based on the fact that the rebates
were not based on the dealership's performance.
     Fortunately, the Court sided with the taxpayer.  The Court
found that the mistaken accounting entries were not fatal.  The
Court looked behind the bookkeeping entries to determine the true
nature of the payments.  It also found that a strict formula was
not necessary for the payments to qualify as discounts.  The
Court noted that the product was unique, there were valid
business reasons for the incentives, and that the company had to
customize the rebates to fit the situations.
     CAUTION.  While the taxpayer won, not having a numerical
formula could cause problems in more normal instances.  Consider
a regular policy first; handling it the way the taxpayer did here
should be your fallback position.
     Getting tricky can get you into trouble.  In another case
(Sun Microsystems, Inc., T.C. Memo. 1993-467) the taxpayer tied
purchase price discounts to the purchase by that customer of
warrants to buy the taxpayer's stock.  Again, the taxpayer won
the case, but not without a fight.

FRINGE BENEFITS--MEAL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES

     On several occasions we've mentioned that not all meal and
entertainment expenses are subject to the 50% rule (i.e., only
50% of the expense can be deducted).  Here's some more
information on one frequently encountered situation.
     Expenses for recreational, social, or similar activity,
primarily for the benefit of employees, is not subject to the 50%
rule.  The exception only applies to expenditures made primarily
for the benefit of employees other than those who are officers,
shareholders or other owners of a 10% or greater interest, or
other highly compensated employees.  Family members of employees
are treated as employees here.
     What sort of activities fall under this exception?
Christmas parties, annual picnics, summer outings, or maintaining
a swimming pool, baseball diamond, bowling alley, etc. are given
in the regulations as examples.  You could probably extend that
to occasional office parties.  If the parties are regular, they
probably won't qualify.  For example, the company signs a big
contract on Thursday.  Friday evening, most of the office goes
out for drinks and dinner, for which the company pays.  That
should qualify.  On the other hand, drinks on the company every
Friday won't.
     If, because of the number of employees, you have to limit
the number of participants, that's all right.  You just can't
discriminate in favor of officers, owners, etc.  That means, you
could fail to fall under the exception if the only people at the
outing are officers, or if family members of owners are invited
by not family members of other employees.

S CORPORATIONS--LOSS PASSTHROUGHS AND BASIS

     Losses generated by S corporations and partnerships are
passed through to the shareholders or partners.  However, the
losses can only be used to reduce your taxable income up to your
basis in the S corporation or partnership.  Losses in excess of
basis can be carried forward and used in a later year.  Your
basis is generally equal to your equity plus any loans you made
to the S corporation.  The same rules apply to partnerships, but
your basis can also include any partnership loans for which
you're liable.
     Example--For 1995 Madison Inc. has a $50,000 loss.  You're
the only shareholder and your basis (at the end of the year, but
before the loss) is $35,000.  You can only deduct $35,000 of the
loss in 1995.  The remaining $15,000 can be carried forward and
deducted in 1996 (or a later year), if you have sufficient basis.
     What are your options?  Tax professionals often
automatically advise loaning enough money to the corporation to
increase your basis so that you can take the entire loss.
     Instead of going with a rule of thumb, work through the
numbers.  Can you use the additional loss in the current year?
Even if you can, does it make sense?  For example, assume you're
normally in the 36% tax bracket, but this year you're in the 15%
bracket.  Any additional loss will only save taxes at 15%.  If
the loss was carried forward, you might be able to offset income
in the 36% bracket.
     If the loss for a year is large enough it could offset all
your income and create a net operating loss (yes, individuals can
have a NOL).  In that case the loss can be carried back three
years.  If you were in a high bracket in that year you might want
to make a capital contribution or loan this year to use the
entire loss.

TAXES--PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES

     More and more companies are challenging their personal
property tax assessments.  If your company has a substantial
amount invested in fixed assets or inventory, arguing your
assessment can save considerable tax dollars.  Property tax laws
vary from state to state, so there are no general rules.  But
here are some points to consider.
     o Make sure the assets are there.  You may be carrying
assets on the books that have been sold or scrapped or moved to
another state.  Consider doing a physical inventory to confirm
the accounting records.
     o If the assessment is based on the book value of the
assets, make sure you're depreciating the assets correctly.
     o Check the law carefully.  The rules vary by state and even
by county and town in many cases.  Some assets may be exempt,
others taxed at a lower rate.  Inventory is exempt in about half
the states.
     o You may be able to challenge the formula.  In a recent
Virginia case the taxpayer fought the county's approach that
valued computer equipment at a rate that declined to no less than
20% of the purchase price after 5 years.  The judge found the
equipment worth no more than 4%  of its cost after 5 years and 1%
in subsequent years.
     o Make sure the property is classified correctly.  There are
a number of areas where the definition of personal and real
property cross.  A single purpose building such as a greenhouse
may be considered personal property in some states; real property
in others.  Items in a building, such as overhead cranes, are
also subject to misclassification.
     o You may be taxed on idle equipment that you haven't used
in years.  Consider abandoning or scraping it.

MANAGEMENT--LICENSING YOUR IDEAS

     You may come up with a idea for a new product, process, etc.
that has potential but that you can't explore because of limited
capital, time, expertise or experience in a particular market.
One way to generate revenue with little or no expense is to
license the product to another firm.  Many products are
manufactured under license.  Unfortunately, you've got to take
steps to protect your idea and maximize the revenue.  Here are
some thoughts.
     o The license agreement is critical.  Get an attorney who's
a specialist in this area.  It may cost you several thousand
dollars more, but it will pay big returns in the long run.
     o The contract should take into account changes in
technology.  That may mean it should be for a limited time.  Or
provide for changes in some way.  Technology is changing more
rapidly than ever.  Many years ago, when personal computers were
in their infancy, a large newspaper gave exclusive rights for on
line access to its paper without any expiration on the agreement.
At that time the agreement was probably worth very little; today
the agreement is a gold mine.  Changing technology can also have
an effect on the medium.  Selling the reproduction rights to a
book today may involve a print edition, movie version,
television, video tape, CD-ROM, and on-line access.  Failure to
cover all possibilities could be costly.
     o Definitions and limitations are important.  Does the
licensee include different versions?  Can the product be sold in
just foreign markets?  Just the U.S.?
     o Make sure the licensee will promote the product.  Chances
are you may be selling the product to a company with a rival
product.  They may buy your idea just to keep it off the market.
Or they may market your product on a token basis.  Or they may
decide not to promote your product until they can leapfrog your
technology.  If all your income is based on royalties, your
return may be minimal.
     o Include the right to cancel the contract after a certain
period of time if the royalties don't reach a certain level.  For
example, if royalties don't reach $20,000 by the end of the one
year after the agreement is signed.  You can include a second and
third level.  For example, royalties must reach $35,000
annualized by the end of the second year.
     o The royalty payment will probably be based on sales of the
product.  The contract should contain a minimum payment amount.
For example, the greater of 2% of sales or $10,000 per year.
That will give the licensee some incentive to push the product.
     o Give the licensee some incentive to increase sales by
providing for progressively lower royalty rates.  For example,
royalties are 5% of the first $500,000 of sales; 4% on the next
$1 million of sales; 3% on sales over $1.5 million.
     o Be sure you have the right to audit the licensee's books.
More than one licensee has understated sales to reduce royalty
payments.
     o If the company produces a competing product you should be
especially careful.  The contract should contain a clause
prohibiting the company from developing or selling a competitive
product during the term of the agreement and possibly for a
certain period after termination.
     o Limit the right to assign the contract.  You may license a
small software producer with revenue of $5 million a year to sell
your product and feel comfortable in dealing with the owners.
What happens if Megasoft Inc. acquires that company?  Will you
still feel comfortable with the license agreement?
     o Be especially careful if the product or idea contains some
proprietary technology.  For example, you may be licensing a new
electronic device for the medical market because you have no
experience in that market.  However, the device contains
proprietary technology that you use in products you sell to the
consumer and military markets.  You want to protect that
technology.
    Licensing can produce significant returns for only a minor
investment.  However, you need to consider all the possibilities
and get good advice before signing a deal.  The investment in
time and money will pay off.  Consider too, that negotiations
here are likely to be tricky.  It's not like selling a business
or division.  You still want control of the product.
     Finally, if the product is not amenable to licensing,
consider selling the rights outright, either in total or in a
particular market.  Many of the suggestions above will still
apply (e.g., limit the ability to assign the agreement, be
careful if the buyer is a competitor, etc.).  If you do so, make
sure you have recourse should the buyer default on any deferred
payments.

PERSONAL FINANCE--CHOOSING AN ADVISOR

     Looking for a personal financial planner?  There's a wide
range of choices.  Everyone's familiar with stockbrokers, but
what does the designation ChFC stand for?  Here are your basic
options.
     Certified Financial Planner  The designation is granted by
the International Board of Standards and Practices for Certified
Financial Planners.  To qualify for the CFP license the candidate
must have at least a bachelor's degree, complete an approved
financial planning program and have at least 3 years experience
in financial planning (varies with education).  The candidate
must pass a comprehensive 2-day, 10-hour exam.  After
certification the individual must complete 30 hours of continuing
professional education every 2 years.
     Chartered Financial Consultant  The designation (ChFC) is
awarded by the American College in Bryn Mawr, PA, which also
grants the CLU (Chartered Life Underwriter) designation.  The
candidate must have at least 3 years of business experience (less
with an undergraduate or graduate degree).  He or she must also
take 10 courses through American College and then pass 10 2-hour
exams.  A ChFC must complete 60 hours of continuing professional
education every 2 years.
     Personal Financial Specialist This is a specialty
designation awarded to CPAs.  The designation is granted by the
AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants).  The
first step in qualifying is to hold a current CPA certificate and
be an AICPA member.  The education requirements are the same as
those for a regular CPA certificate and vary by state.  However,
every CPA must pass a comprehensive exam that is the same from
state to state.  In order to receive the Personal Financial
Specialist (PFS) designation, the CPA must have at least 250
hours of financial planning experience each year for the
preceding 3 years and pass a comprehensive 6-hour exam.  A PFS
must complete at least 72 hours of continuing education in
personal financial planning every 3 years (in addition to 750
hours of experience every 3 years).
     Chartered Financial Analyst A CFA is more likely to be a
securities analyst or investment adviser than a personal
financial planner.  He must have a bachelor's degree or an
equivalent amount of work experience and pass three comprehensive
tests, each of which is 6 hours long.  He must have 3 years of
experience as a financial analyst.
     The tests for the first three designations focus on
financial planning fundamentals, income taxation, insurance,
investments, estate and retirement planning, etc.  The CFA
designation focuses on financial accounting, quantitative
analysis, securities analysis, etc.
     Broker or Registered Representative  The person must have a
background in the securities business and pass a series of tests,
including the General Securities Examination and state securities
tests.  He is "registered" with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  He generally works for a brokerage house.
     Other Choices There are many other individuals who will
provide financial advice, but whose qualifications are unlikely
to match those mentioned above.
     Pros and Cons For overall financial planning (estate
planning, insurance, tax planning, etc.) the first three choices,
certified financial planner, chartered financial consultant and
personal financial specialist are about equally ranked.  A
personal financial specialist might have the edge if the CPA firm
you're dealing with has one or you need the broad base of
knowledge that a CPA has.  For example, a CPA with a PFS
designation might be better able to help you with both business
and personal financial planning.  You should be wary of brokers
and other planners since their background is not as general and
they are likely to steer you into investments that they sell.  A
chartered financial analyst would be a good choice for help in
picking particular securities or industries to invest in, but may
not be a good choice for overall planning.
     A final word.  Even accredited professionals should be
checked out.  Ask about their experience.  It is not
inappropriate to get references or ask business associates, your
banker, etc. about them.  And you've got to feel comfortable with
the planner.  Personal feelings are sure to creep in to the
planner's opinions.  For example, a 60-year old adviser is likely
to be more risk adverse than one 30 years old.

THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNet
January 1, 1996

IN BRIEF:

     Director's liability . . . Officers and directors of
corporations owe a fiduciary responsibility to the corporation
they represent.  Clearly, that means they can be held liable if
they act in bad faith or with gross negligence.  And it goes
without saying that an officer or director has to put the
interests of the corporation ahead of his personal interests if
his interests conflict with those of the corporation.  However, a
board member who does nothing may be at risk.  Board members have
been sued for inattention to the matters of the corporation.
     Leasing . . . Leasing, instead of buying and financing the
purchase, may make sense for a lot of reasons, but keeping your
balance sheet clean probably isn't one of them.  In most cases a
lease obligation has to be disclosed.  In the case of a finance
lease (basically, where you own the equipment at the end of the
term for little or no extra outlay), the capitalized value is an
asset; the payments are a liability.  Even if you don't have
regular financial statements, most creditors will ask you about
lease obligations.
     Bonuses . . . Want to reward an executive or employee?
Giving a bonus rather than a big raise can make sense.  Three
reasons.  First, giving a raise may affect other payments such as
vacation and sick pay.  Second, should the employee not perform
as well next year, or if you're strapped for cash, you won't be
locked into a higher salary.  Third, it's usually much easier to
keep a bonus quiet than a raise.  That means you can give it
selectively without creating office talk.
     Speed is everything . . . You're buying a new computer.
What should you look for?  The MHz (megahertz) rating is
important, but if you're looking for pure speed, that's not the
only factor.  Final results will depend on a number of factors.
For example, if you're running software that's heavily dependent
on RAM (random access memory) you could find that a 90MHz Pentium
machine with 16M bytes (megabytes) of RAM is significantly faster
than a 133MHz unit with 8M bytes of RAM.  If your budget is
tight, you might want to go with the slower machine and use the
savings to put in more RAM.  Likewise, if you do a lot of
graphics work, a graphics accelerator card with extra memory will
pay for itself.
     Merger mania . . . If you've got a significant portfolio of
stocks, sooner or later one of them might be a merger target.  If
the deal's all cash, you've got no choice.  However, in many
deals you have an option.  You can elect to take the cash or take
the stock in the acquiring or combined entity.  What's the best
approach?  If you take the cash, you'll have an immediate gain or
loss.  If you take the stock, your gain or loss will be deferred
until you sell the new stock.  Deferring the gain can make sense
in many cases, particularly if you've already realized
substantial gains during the year.  Talk to your tax and
investment advisors.  If you're going to take the stock and plan
to hold it for a while, be sure the prospects for the acquiring
company are sound.
     Tax exempt munis from Puerto Rico . . . The general rule is
that obligations issued by a state or municipality is exempt from
federal income tax and from tax in the state of issuance.  For
example, if you're a Massachusetts resident, interest on bonds
issued by Massachusetts (or a municipality in the state) would
not be taxable.  If you're a New York resident, the income would
be taxable.  There's an exception.  Interest on bonds issued by
Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are exempt in all states.
Thus, interest on a bond issued by the Virgin Islands would be
exempt to both a New York and a Massachusetts resident.  These
bonds can be particularly useful to taxpayers who are transferred
frequently.
     Slow payers . . . Your terms are net 30 but Madison Inc.
always pays you 60 days after billing.  They're an important,
long-time customer and the check always arrives on the 60th day
so you live with it.  That may be all you can do.  However, you
should still monitor the payments.  If the 60 days begins to
stretch to 65 or 70 days, there may be a real problem.  Even if
the company is still financially sound, they may be testing you.
Now's the time to step in and make sure they don't stretch
payments any farther.  In fact, it may be the perfect opportunity
to ask them to speed up payments.
     Is the property insurable? . . . That may be the first
question you should ask before purchasing a new home (or business
property).  Many insurers, hit by huge claims, are avoiding
certain areas or properties entirely.  For example, several
companies will write no policies on homes within 1,000 of the
coastline.  You may still be able to get insurance, but only for
a big premium.  An extra 10 feet back may save you over $1,000
per year.  You should also keep insurability in mind if you're
buying a new car, investing in a business, etc.

               SUMMARIES OF TODAY'S IMPORTANT TAX NEWS.

             TAX ANALYSTS ANNOUNCES NEW CITATION SYSTEMS.

     Starting January 1, 1996, Tax Analysts adopted a new citation
system to identify full text documents. A single, uniform number now
identifies each new document that we add to our print, electronic,
microfiche, fax, and CD-ROM publications. You can use that number to
obtain documents in whatever publishing medium you find most
convenient.

     No matter where a document appears or how you choose to order
it, the identifying number is now the same.

     The new citation format consists of the abbreviation "Doc"
followed by the last two digits of the current year, plus a serial
number. For example, the 141st document received by Tax Analysts in
1996 is identified in this way:

                             Doc 96-141

     Pre-1996 documents will continue to be identified by means of
our earlier citation systems. In other words, citations already
assigned to documents will not change.

     We believe that our customers will find our new citation system
to be substantially simpler and more convenient than the multiple
systems that we have used in the past.

Pinpoint Citations

     Along with the unified full text citation system, Tax Analysts
now provides pinpoint citations by means of bracketed paragraph
numbers in full text documents appearing in our print and electronic
publications. The new system enables you to specify the precise
portions of a full text document to which you wish to make reference.

     The new pinpoint citation system is available in substantially
all full text documents produced by Tax Analysts in print and
electronic form, including court decisions, IRS announcements and
rulings, congressional reports, and the like.

     The new paragraph numbering system does not apply to documents
that already have their own numbering system, such as statutes and
IRS regulations.

     The new paragraph numbering system is based on precedents
developed in British Columbia and recently adopted by the Supreme
Court of Canada. Paragraph numbering has been discussed extensively
in the United States as a means of providing pinpoint citations in
electronic texts, but it appears that Tax Analysts's adoption of
paragraph numbering is the first broadscale use of paragraphing to
provide pinpoint text citations.

     To cite to a specific paragraph in a Tax Analysts's document,
simply place a comma after the document citation and then add the
relevant paragraph number. For example:

                           Doc 96-141, 28

     Ranges of paragraphs or a series of individual paragraphs may be
cited as follows:

                          Doc 96-141, 28-33

                                 or

                       Doc 96-141, 28, 37, 54

     Tax Analysts' citation system and its guidelines for paragraph
numbering are not copyrighted. The memorandums discussing these
issues, together with the related computer programs, are available to
interested members of the public, and to other publishers, on
request. They will be made available in January 1996 on the Internet.

     If you have questions about our new full text document citation
system or need assistance, call Customer Service at (800) 955-3444.

           BUDGET NEGOTIATORS SET TO MEET THROUGH WEEKEND.

     Congressional and White House negotiators left the Capitol
December 29 promising to meet through the weekend if necessary to
hammer out a budget deal.

     "I expect us to make further progress," President Clinton told
reporters. "We will begin to deal with some of the difficult issues
today involving how we can balance the budget and protect Medicare,
Medicaid, education and the environment," said Clinton, who did not
mention taxes.

     House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said, "There are reasons to
be cautiously optimistic. I would hope that over the next two or
three days we could basically get this done and have everything up
and running and everyone paid for while the staff work[s] out the
technical details."

                AIRLINE EXCISE TAXES SLATED TO EXPIRE.

     The 10 percent excise tax on airline tickets was scheduled to
expire at midnight December 31 unless Congress and the president
approved legislation to extend it. That was considered an unlikely
prospect, although high-level budget meetings were scheduled to
continue through the weekend.

     Under the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Program, excise taxes
are imposed on domestic passenger tickets, domestic freight waybills,
international departures, and noncommercial aviation fuel.

     The budget reconciliation bill Congress passed in November would
extend these excise taxes through September 30, 1996. Contingent on
this extension, the reconciliation bill also would extend through
next September 30 airlines' exemption from the 4.3-cent-per-gallon
tax on aviation fuel.

    IRS AND NATIONAL ARCHIVES AT LOGGERHEADS ON ACCESS TO RECORDS.

     Writing a history of the IRS from the advent of the modern
income tax (1913) to today would be difficult. The National Archives
does not have much information, and the IRS is not likely to provide
any. Unlike most government agencies, the IRS does not turn many of
its records over to the Archives. This has been its practice since
the 1920s. Since 1976, with the tightening of the confidentiality
rules under Internal Revenue Code section 6103, the IRS has been even
less willing to turn over records to the nation's document preserver.

     Even an employee authorized to use internal records would have
difficulty researching a complete history of the agency -- because
the IRS does not have its own centralized recordkeeping or filing
system.

     Recently, the IRS's first and only historian, Shelly Davis,
resigned in protest over the way the IRS was mishandling its records
and the agency's refusal to send documents to the National Archives
as required by law. (See The Wall Street Journal, Dec. 15, 1995, p.
A1.)

     And late last year, the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) issued a report evaluating the IRS's records
management. NARA found that the IRS is neglecting federal laws
regarding record retention.

     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-4

     IRS RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PANNED BY NATIONAL ARCHIVES.

     The IRS's records management program has serious shortcomings
that must be fixed if the agency is to be in compliance with federal
law, according to a recent report by the National Archives. The
evaluation of IRS practices found that the agency does not send to
the Archives the kinds of records routinely transferred to it by
other federal agencies -- which is a nice way of saying the IRS is
not doing what the law says it has to do.

     An important concern is the Archives' inability to appraise
documents for archival retention because of disclosure restrictions
claimed by the IRS under Internal Revenue Code section 6103, which
restricts the disclosure of tax return information.

     The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is
authorized to conduct inspections or surveys of the records, records
management programs and practices of federal agencies, and recommend
improvements.

     Authority to save or dispose of a government record must come
from NARA. This is done through records control schedules, which
direct what happens to a record or class of records. The schedules
are prepared by the federal agency, but the final disposition of a
record or class of records must be approved by NARA. An agency cannot
legally take unilateral actions on records dispositions.

YEAR IN REVIEW: FOR THE SERVICE, 'PIVOTAL' YEAR CONTAINS ITS SHARE OF
                              SETBACKS.

     By all accounts, 1995 was a trying year for the Service. In many
high-profile areas -- computer modernization, the budget, electronic
filing, and compliance programs -- IRS setbacks seemed to outnumber
the victories, at least as far as Congress was concerned.

     After years of favorable treatment from congressional
appropriators, the IRS found the new GOP Congress resistant to
administration funding requests. Lawmakers, frustrated by what they
saw as a spending vacuum caused by Tax Systems Modernization (TSM),
became increasingly critical of whether TSM funds were being used
effectively.

     The net budget result: $200 million less in funding than the
agency received in fiscal 1995, and nearly $1 billion less than
requested by President Clinton. Before the IRS budget was signed in
late November, the agency had endured a several-day shutdown and
announced an indefinite suspension of the Taxpayer Compliance
Measurement Program (TCMP). Along with the TCMP, casualties included
the elimination of a couple thousand IRS jobs, forcing officials to
make some tough choices, not all of which were well-received.

                TWO MEN CHARGED IN RENO BOMBING PLOT.

     Two Nevada men were charged last week with attempting to bomb an
IRS building in Reno in December.

     Ellis Hurst, 52, and Joseph Bailie, 40, both of Gardnerville,
Nev., appeared before U.S. Federal Magistrate Phyllis Atkins and were
charged with attempted destruction of a government building and use
of a destructive device in a crime of violence. (For prior coverage,
see Doc 96-435 (2 pages), 95 TNT 253-4, or H&D, Dec. 29, 1995, p.
5141.)

     The men are accused of attempting to set off a bomb December 18
in a parking lot adjacent to the IRS building in Reno. Authorities
found that the fuse of the bomb had been lit, but that the bomb did
not explode.

     Reuters reported last week that the men had a dispute with the
IRS. "Hurst related both he and Bailie had had difficulties with the
Internal Revenue Service in the past," said Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Special Agent Richard Stoltz.

     The BATF said the the material removed from the device was a
mixture of fertilizer and fuel. Authorities said that had it
exploded, it would have injured or killed many people.

     Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron Rachow said the men face a 30-year
mandatory minimum sentence for use of the explosive device. He said
he would seek grand jury indictments.

     IRS senior spokesman Frank Keith said the agency's field offices
all have disaster recovery plans in place in case of a bombing, an
act of God, or some other violent episode.

     The disaster recovery plan was most recently used last spring
when an off-site building at the Martinsburg Computing Center in West
Virginia caught fire in the middle of the night. Because of the
contingency plan, IRS employees were able to get telephone service
restored and computers working by the next morning.

 IRS ISSUES PROPOSED RULES ON DISTRIBUTIONS OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES
                          BY A PARTNERSHIP.

     The Service has issued proposed regulations (PS-2-95) relating
to the treatment of a distribution of marketable securities by a
partnership. The regs reflect the amendment made to section 731(c) by
the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-465) regarding the
treatment of marketable securities as money for purposes of sections
731(a)(1) and 737.

     In general, the term "marketable securities" includes any
financial instruments that are actively traded. Further, section
731(c)(2)(B)(v) provides that an interest in an entity is a
marketable security if substantially all of the entity's assets
consist of marketable securities or money. The proposed regulations
provide that substantially all of the assets of an entity consist of
marketable securities or money only if 90 percent or more of the
entity's assets at the time of the distribution consist of such
assets.

     In addition, the proposed regs provide that an interest in an
entity is a marketable security to the extent that the value of the
interest is attributable to marketable securities or money that
constitute less than 90 percent but 20 percent or more of the
entity's assets. The 20 percent threshold means that an interest in
an entity holding only a small amount of marketable securities won't
be treated as a marketable security.

     The proposed regulations also provide that a marketable security
will continue to be treated as a marketable security even if the
partnership or its partners are restricted by agreement or otherwise
from selling or exchanging the security. According to the Service,
that provision is intended to prevent a partnership from avoiding
section 731(c) by temporarily restricting the transferability of the
distributed security.

     Consistent with section 731(c)(3)(A), the proposed regs contain
three exceptions to section 731(c). First, they provide that if the
marketable security was contributed to the partnership by the
distributee partner, section 731(c) doesn't apply to the distribution
of that security.

     Second, the regs provide that section 731(c) doesn't apply to
the distribution of a marketable security to the extent that the
security was acquired by the partnership in a nonrecognition
transaction in exchange for property other than marketable securities
or cash and (i) the security is actively traded as of the date of
distribution and (ii) the security is distributed by the partnership
within five years of either the date the security was acquired by the
partnership or, if later, the date the security became actively
traded.

     The proposed regulations further provide that section 731(c)
doesn't apply to the distribution of a marketable security if (i) the
security wasn't actively traded on the date acquired by the
partnership and the entity to which the security relates has no
outstanding actively traded securities at the time the security was
acquired by the partnership; (ii) the security is actively traded as
of the date of distribution; and (iii) the security was held by the
partnership for at least six months before it became actively traded
and the security was distributed by the partnership within five years
of the date on which it became actively traded.

     Section 731(c) doesn't apply to the distribution of marketable
securities by an investment partnership to an eligible partner. The
regs contain provisions relating to that exception. The proposed
regulations also provide rules for coordinating section 731(c) with
sections 704(c)(1)(B) and 737. Finally, the regs contain an anti-
abuse rule stating that the provisions of section 731(c) and the
regulations must be applied in a manner that's consistent with the
purpose of section 731(c) and the substance of the transaction.

     The regulations are proposed to apply to distributions of
marketable securities by a partnership to a partner on or after
December 29, 1995. A public hearing on the regs has been scheduled
for April 3, 1996, beginning at 10:00 a.m., in the IRS Auditorium in
Washington. Written comments on the proposed regulations and requests
to speak at the hearing (with outlines of oral comments) are due by
March 13, 1996.

           IRS CANCELS HEARING ON PROPOSED SUBPART F REGS.

     The Service has canceled the public hearing on the proposed
regulations (IL-75-92) under sections 952, 954(c), and 960 relating
to the definition of subpart F income and foreign personal holding
company income of a controlled foreign corporation and the allocation
of deficits for purposes of computing the deemed-paid foreign tax
credit. The hearing had been scheduled to take place on January 4,
1996. (For text of the proposed regulations, see 95 TNT 175-7 or H&D,
Sept. 7, 1995, Special Supplement.)

   IRS PROPOSES RULES ON TRANSFERS OF STOCK IN U.S. CORPORATIONS TO
                        FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.

     The Service has issued proposed regulations under section 367
concerning transfers of stock or securities of domestic corporations
by United States persons to foreign corporations pursuant to a
corporate organization, reorganization, or liquidation.
(IL-9-95) (60 F.R. 66771-66772)

 IRS PROPOSES RULES FOR ALLOCATION OF ACCRUED PENSION PLAN BENEFITS.

     The Service has issued proposed regulations (EE-35-95) under
section 411 that provide rules for calculating an employee's accrued
benefit derived from the employee's contributions to a qualified
defined benefit pension plan. The regs reflect changes made by the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 and the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, which amended the law to change the
accumulation of employee contributions and the conversion of those
accumulated contributions to employee-derived accrued benefits.

     Before OBRA '89, section 411(c)(2)(B) specified that the
conversion factor to be used to compute the employee-derived accrued
benefit was 10 percent for a straight life annuity beginning at
normal retirement age of 65, and that for other normal retirement
ages, the conversion factor was to be determined in accordance with
regulations. OBRA '89 deleted the 10 percent conversion factor and
replaced it with the requirement that the accumulated contributions
at normal retirement age be expressed as an annual benefit beginning
at normal retirement age using an interest rate that would be used
under the plan under section 417(e)(3).

     To reflect the OBRA '89 amendments, the proposed regulations
define "appropriate conversion factor" for an accrued benefit
expressed in the form of an annual benefit that is nondecreasing for
the life of the participant as the present value of an annuity in the
form of that annual benefit beginning at normal retirement age at a
rate of $1 per year. That amount is to be computed using the interest
rate and mortality table that would be used under the plan under
section 417(e)(3) and reg. section 1.417(e)-1T. To reflect the post-
OBRA '89 conversion factor definition and to conform to common
actuarial practice, the proposed regs would change the "multiplied
by" language in reg. section 1.411(c)-1(c)(1) to "divided by."

     Section 411(c)(2)(C), as amended by OBRA '89, provides that an
interest rate of 120 percent of the applicable federal midterm rate
under section 1274 is to be used for accumulating contributions only
up to the "determination date." For the period from the determination
date to normal retirement age, the interest rate that would be used
under section 417(e)(3) must be used. The proposed regs would amend
existing reg. section 1.411(c)-1(c)(3) to reflect those rates.

     Proposed reg. section 1.411(c)-1(c)(5)(i) defines "determination
date" for purposes of section 411(c)(2)(C)(iii) in a case in which a
participant will receive his or her entire accrued benefit derived
from employee contributions in any one of the following forms: an
annuity that is substantially nonincreasing, substantially
nonincreasing installment payments for a fixed number of years, or a
single sum distribution. In such a case, "determination date" means
the date on which distribution of the benefit begins. For that
purpose, an annuity that is nonincreasing except for automatic
increases to reflect increases in the consumer price index is
considered to be an annuity that is substantially nonincreasing.

     The regulations are proposed to be effective for plan years
beginning on or after January 1, 1997.

     FINAL REGS PROVIDE RULES FOR CASH REPORTING BY COURT CLERKS.

     The Service has issued final regulations (T.D. 8652) under
section 6050I(g) on the information reporting requirements for
federal and state court clerks on receipt of more than $10,000 in
cash as bail for any individual charged with a specified criminal
offense. T.D. 8652 adopts with revisions the temporary and proposed
regulations (T.D. 8572; IA-57-94) that were published on December 15,
1994.

     The 1994 regulations provided that a clerk is the clerk's office
or the office, department, division, branch, or unit of the court
that is authorized to receive bail. According to the Service, a
commentator suggested that the regs clarify whether reporting under
section 6050I(g) is required by a clerk if an entity that is not a
part of the court receives bail. In some jurisdictions, for example,
a sheriff receives bail. The final regulations provide that if
someone other than a clerk receives bail on behalf of a clerk, the
clerk is treated as receiving the bail. Therefore, the clerk must
file the information return.

     Under the 1994 regs, a statement must be sent to each payer of
bail reporting certain information, including the aggregate amount of
reportable cash received by the clerk. The final regulations clarify
that the aggregate amount requirement can be satisfied either by
sending a single written statement with an aggregate amount listed or
by furnishing a copy of each Form 8300 relating to that payer of bail.

     The final regulations also clarify that if multiple payments are
made to satisfy bail reportable under section 6050I(g) and the
initial payment doesn't exceed $10,000, the initial payment and
subsequent payments must be aggregated and the information return
must be filed by the 15th day after receipt of the payment that
causes the aggregate amount to exceed $10,000. However, payments made
to satisfy separate bail requirements aren't required to be
aggregated.

   IRS FINALIZES ALLOCATION AND APPORTIONMENT RULES FOR R&E COSTS.

     The Service has issued final regulations under section 861
concerning the allocation and apportionment of research and
experimental (R&E) expenditures for purposes of determining taxable
income from U.S. and non-U.S. sources. The regulations do not make
major changes in the proposed regulations, and are effective January
1, 1996.

     The proposed regulations contained three principal changes in
to the existing regs. First, allocation of R&E costs to three digit
-- rather than two digit -- SIC code product categories of gross
income would be permitted. Second, the percentage of R&E costs that
may be exclusively apportioned to U.S.-source income under the sales
method of apportionment under reg. section 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii) would be
increased from 30 percent to 50 percent. And third, use of the
optional gross income methods of apportionment would constitute a
binding election to use those methods in subsequent years.

     The Service agreed to a change regarding the optional gross
income methods of apportionment. It was suggested that the final
rules include a 50 percent exclusive place of performance
apportionment under the optional gross income methods to be parallel
with reg. section 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii)(A). The final regs don't go that
far: they include a 25 percent exclusive place of performance
apportionment under the optional gross income methods.

     The regs also change the binding election rules: IRS permission
will not be required to change methods under reg. section 1.861-
8(e)(3)(iii)(C), provided that the taxpayer has used one method for
five years.

   FINAL REGS PROVIDE PAL RULES FOR RENTAL REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES.

     The Service has issued final regulations (T.D. 8645) under
section 469 providing rules for rental real estate activities of
taxpayers engaged in real property trades or businesses. The
regulations reflect changes to the law made by the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993. The final regulations adopt the proposed
regs (PS-80-93) published on January 10, 1995, with revisions. (For
the full text, see 95 TNT 6-11.)

     OBRA '93 added section 469(c)(7), which provides that rental
real estate activities of qualifying taxpayers are not subject to the
rule that treats all rental activities as passive. It also provides
that each of a qualifying taxpayer's interests in rental real estate
is treated as a separate activity unless the taxpayer elects to treat
all interest in rental real estate as a single activity.

     The proposed regs provided rules for determining whether a
taxpayer qualifies for treatment under section 469(c)(7). Except for
modifications in response to comments received on the proposed regs,
the final regs generally adopt the rules in the proposed regs.

     Citing the statutory language and legislative history, the
Service said the final regs retain the rule in the proposed regs
prohibiting qualifying taxpayers from grouping rental real estate
activities with other activities in determining whether the taxpayers
materially participate in the rental real estate activities. It said
it invites comments, however, on whether the material participation
tests in reg. section 1.469-5T(a) should be amended to include a
look-back material participation test for taxpayers significantly
involved in the development or construction of their rental real
estate interests.

     The final regs are effective for tax years beginning on or after
January 1, 1995.

     PARTNERSHIP PROPERTY DISTRIBUTION REGULATIONS ARE FINALIZED.

     The Service has issued final regulations (T.D. 8642) under
section 704(c) relating to the recognition of gain or loss on the
distribution of contributed property by a partnership under section
704(c)(1)(B). T.D. 8642 also provides final rules on the recognition
of gain on certain distributions to a contributing partner under
section 737.

     The final regs clarify the proposed rules in a number of
respects, but do not make major changes. The final regs are effective
January 9, 1995. (For text of the proposed regs (PS-76-92), see 95
TNT 5-7 or H&D, Jan. 9, 1995, p. 515.)

     The Service noted that a clarification was sought on the
interaction of the like-kind exception and the disguised sale rules
of section 707(a)(2)(B). The Service says there's "no suggestion in
section 704(c)(2) or the proposed regulations that the like-kind
exception was intended as an exception to the disguised sale
provisions." The final regs confirm that the disguised sale rules can
apply to a distribution, "even if the distribution would otherwise
have qualified for the section 704(c)(2) like-kind exception."

     Despite numerous suggestions for "clarifying or modifying the
anti-abuse rule in the proposed regulations," the final regs adopt
the proposed rule without change.

       FINAL GSTT REGS ELIMINATE CONTROVERSIAL 'SPOUSAL RULE.'

     The Service has issued final generation-skipping transfer tax
regulations (T.D. 8644) under chapter 13 of the code. T.D. 8644
adopts with revisions proposed regulations (PS-73-88; PS-32-90)
published on December 24, 1992. The final regulations are effective
December 27, 1995.

     One notable change concerns the estate tax inclusion period
(ETIP). Proposed reg. section 26.2632-1(c)(2)(ii) provided that an
ETIP existed during the period in which the transferred property
would have been includable in the transferor's gross estate had the
transferor retained an interest held by the transferor's spouse, but
only to the extent the spouse acquired the interest from the
transferor in an inter vivos transfer that was not included in the
transferor's taxable gifts or for which a deduction was allowed under
section 2523. According to the Service, commentators stated that
there was no support in the statute for that spousal rule, and any
such rule would require a legislative change. The final regs
eliminate the spousal rule and Example 5 of reg. section 26.2632-
1(c)(5).

     Some of the other more significant revisions involve various
definitions. Proposed reg. section 26.2612-1(a)(2)(i) provided
generally that for purposes of determining whether a transfer
constitutes a direct skip, the generation assignment of a person who
would otherwise be a skip person is redetermined by disregarding the
intervening generation, if certain individuals have died before the
transfer (for example, a predeceased child of the transferor). That
section has been modified to provide that if an individual who is a
member of the intervening generation dies no later than 90 days after
the transfer, the deceased individual is treated as having
predeceased the transferor, if the governing instrument or applicable
state law provides for that treatment.

     Further, reg. section 26.2612-1(a)(2)(ii) has been added to
provide that if a transferor makes an addition to an existing trust
after the death of an individual described in section 26.2612-
1(a)(2)(i) (that is, an individual in the intervening generation),
the additional property is treated as being held in a separate trust
for purposes of chapter 13.

     Other revisions, modifications, and clarifications to the
proposed regulations concern the transition rules, the uniform
statutory rule against perpetuities, allocation of the GST exemption,
erroneous allocations, the determination of the applicable fraction,
the division of a single trust into separate trusts, and the
application of chapter 13 to nonresident aliens.

      IRS UPDATES RULES FOR FORM 1040 ONLINE ELECTRONIC FILING.

     The Service in Revenue Procedure 96-20 has set forth guidelines
and requirements for those who participate in the 1996 online
electronic filing program for Forms 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ. Rev.
Proc. 96-20 updates and supersedes Rev. Proc. 95-13, 1995-1 C.B. 514.
The updates include changes in the online filing program for the 1996
filing season, clarification of prior online filing program
statements, and additional guidance derived from other IRS documents
that relate to the online filing program.

         SUSPENDED S CORPORATION LOSSES AREN'T TRANSFERABLE.

     In technical advice, the Service has ruled that a taxpayer may
not deduct losses disallowed and suspended under section 1366(d)(1)
at a time when the taxpayer's former spouse owned the S corporation
stock.

     The husband and wife separately owned shares of the S
corporation's stock. In a year when the corporation had a loss, a
portion of the husband's loss was disallowed at the shareholder level
because the loss exceeded his adjusted basis in the stock.

     The husband subsequently transferred all of his stock in the
corporation to the wife incident to their divorce. As of that date,
the husband had not taken the carried over losses.

     For the tax year at issue, the wife deducted the losses carried
over from the year when the husband owned the stock. On audit, the
losses were disallowed because they were associated with stock owned
by the husband and, the IRS agent asserted, could not be transferred
to the wife.

     Agreeing with the auditing agent, the Service pointed out that
section 1366(d)(2) provides that any loss disallowed by the basis
limitation in section 1366(d)(1) is treated as incurred by the
corporation in the succeeding tax year "with respect to that
shareholder." The use of the words "with respect to that
shareholder," the Service said, requires that losses be personal to a
shareholder and that they not be transferred in any manner.

     The Service further concluded that section 1041 doesn't change
that result, adding that no gain or loss is recognized on the
husband's transfer of the stock to the wife. The transfer is treated
as a gift, it said, and the wife's basis in the stock is the
husband's adjusted basis at the time of the transfer.

    COMPANY MUST PAY INTEREST ON BACKUP WITHHOLDING TAX LIABILITY.

     The Service has ruled in technical advice that a corporation is
liable for interest regarding backup withholding tax liability
imposed by section 3406.

     In 1992, the corporation was selected for a Form 1099 compliance
check for the years 1990 and 1991. At the conclusion of the
compliance check, the IRS examiner proposed assessments for backup
withholding tax liability under section 3406 because the corporation
filed Forms 1099 without taxpayer identification numbers. Also,
penalties were assessed under section 6721 for failure to file
correct Forms 1099 and under section 6722 for failure to furnish
correct Forms 1099.

     Most of the backup withholding tax liability asserted against
the corporation was abated under section 3402(d); however, interest,
penalties, and a portion of the backup withholding tax liability were
not abated. No agreement was reached at the examination level or at
IRS Appeals. The IRS district director made a notice and demand for
the assessed taxes and interest.

     The Service noted that the corporation would not be liable for
interest if the interest-free adjustment provisions of section 6205
applied. If the corporation had satisfied that section's requirements
for reporting the tax and making a supplemental return, it could
qualify for an adjustment of its backup withholding tax liability.
However, the Service pointed out, notice and demand for payment of
the tax due was made before the filing of the supplemental return (or
the deemed filing of a supplemental return by signing an agreement to
the adjustment). Consequently, under reg. section 31.6205-1(a)(6),
the interest-free adjustment provisions of section 6205 don't apply.

     Therefore, the Service concluded, regarding the backup
withholding tax that has been abated under section 3402(d), the
corporation is liable for interest for the periods beginning with the
due date of the return for the period in which it was required to
withhold, but failed to do so, until the recipient of the reportable
payment satisfied his federal income tax liability for the period at
issue. Regarding liability for backup withholding tax that hasn't
been abated, the Service said, the corporation is liable for interest
for the periods beginning with the due date of the return for the
period in which it was required to withhold, but didn't, until it
pays the tax, or the recipient pays income tax on the reportable
amount, whichever is earlier.

       SELF-UNLOADING FARM VEHICLES ARE SUBJECT TO EXCISE TAX.

     The Service has ruled in technical advice that a self-unloading
automobile truck body manufactured by a company and sold through its
retail division is subject to the section 4051 excise tax.

     The company is in the business of manufacturing agricultural
equipment, including the self-unloading truck body. The body has a V-
shaped bottom that the company says was designed to haul farm cargo
such as seed and harvested potatoes. The body has a variable speed
unloading conveyer belt and a drive system that may be driven by the
transmission's power take-off. The variable speed function is
incorporated into the design of the unloading system to match the
unloading speeds required for each type of load that may be carried
by the body. The company's sales literature states that the body may
be used to haul seed, potatoes, beets, and small grains.

     In ruling that sales of the truck body were taxable, the Service
pointed out that the exemption provided by section 4053(2) doesn't
extend to truck bodies designed for general use, even though the
bodies are used to transport farm cargo. To be exempt, it said, a
body must be primarily designed to haul seed, feed, or fertilizer to
and on farms. The Service found the truck bodies in question to be
functionally similar to those described in Rev. Rul. 75-462, 1975-2
C.B. 419, in that they are not primarily designed to haul seed, feed,
or fertilizer. Rather, as suggested in the company's sales
literature, the bodies in question are designed for general hauling
of farm cargo, in addition to seed, the Service concluded.

 FUND-RAISING ORGANIZATION'S OPERATION OF FISHING FACILITY GIVES RISE
                TO UBIT; ROYALTY ARGUMENT IS REJECTED.

     The Service has ruled that amounts a section 501(c)(3) fund-
raising organization receives in operating fishing facilities at a
lake are subject to unrelated business income tax.

     Under an agreement with an other entity, the exempt organization
is licensed, for a fee, to occupy and use a lake and the adjoining
support facilities (a dock), to provide the public with a lake area
specifically for fishing on alternate weekends, year-round. The
exempt sells fishing passes to the public on a first-come, first-
served basis. Activities at the lake are controlled by paid personnel
who operate a ticket office, police the facility, and supervise the
dock and boat ramp. General recreation activities, such as picnicking
and swimming, are prohibited at the lake.

     No apparent charitable activity takes place at the lake. The
fund-raising organization entered the license agreement solely to
generate revenues which, after the payment of expenses, will be
distributed to client social service and welfare agencies.

     The Service concluded that payments the exempt receives from the
general public for use of the lake are income from an unrelated trade
or business regularly carried on. The Service noted that usage of the
lake is similar to any commercial fishing facility. Comparing the
arrangement to greens fees paid to play golf, the Service said the
admission fee is a charge for the provision of personal services.

    GAO DEEMS 1995 FILING SEASON GOOD -- DESPITE SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

     The General Accounting Office has concluded that the IRS had a
successful 1995 filing season, although the agency still had some
serious difficulties, particularly on the public relations front.

     Although IRS indicators show that most of the 1995 filing season
goals were met, the GAO found, anti-fraud initiatives caused much
adverse publicity, taxpayers continued to have serious problems
reaching the IRS on the telephone, and a new document system designed
to increase productivity failed to do so.

     The GAO praised IRS steps to combat fraud, but said the outcry
over the delay of more than 7 million refunds could have been avoided
had the IRS done a better job of communicating that even taxpayers
with legitimate returns might be subject to a delay.

 IRS ISSUES TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED REGS ON TRANSFERS OF STOCK IN U.S.
                CORPORATIONS TO FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.

     The Service has issued temporary and proposed regulations (T.D.
8638; INTL-9-95) under section 367 concerning transfers of stock or
securities of domestic corporations by United States persons to
foreign corporations pursuant to the code's corporate organization,
reorganization, or liquidation provisions. To a large degree, the
regulations simply update and coordinate temporary guidance provided
since the relevant statutory changes were enacted in 1984.

     Temporary and proposed regulations issued in May 1986 included
section 1.367(a)-3T, which relates to transfers of stock or
securities of domestic or foreign corporations by U.S. persons to
foreign corporations. The Service modified those regulations in
Notice 87-85, 1987-2 C.B. 395. Regulations based on Notice 87-85 were
issued in August 1991, and further guidance was provided in Notice
94-46, 1994-1 C.B. 356. The regulations that have been set forth in
T.D. 8638 incorporate and modify the rules announced in Notice 94-46.

     The positions taken in Notice 94-46 have been modified in two
significant ways. First, the regulations shift the ownership
threshold from "50 percent or more" to "more than 50 percent," so
that a U.S. transferor may qualify for an exception to section 367(a)
in situations where U.S. transferors, in the aggregate, receive
exactly 50 percent of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation
in the exchange.

     Second, although the new regulations retain the presumption that
shareholders of the U.S. target company are U.S. persons, generally
it does not retain the cross-ownership presumption or take cross-
ownership into account. The Service explained that the regulations
count cross-ownership "only in the limited circumstance where U.S.
officers, directors, and 5 percent or greater shareholders of the
U.S. target company own, in the aggregate, more than 50 percent of
the total voting power or the total value of the transferee foreign
corporation immediately after the transfer (a control group case)."
In such a case, the Service said, the exchange is taxable to all U.S.
transferors.

  IRS RELEASES 1988 INTERNAL NOTICE OUTLINING PURPOSE OF LITIGATION
                           GUIDELINE MEMOS.

     The Service has released a 1988 internal notice that outlines
the purpose of Litigation Guideline Memorandums (LGMs). The notice
characterizes LGMs as "Law Enforcement Manual directives" not subject
to public release.

     According to the internal notice, N (32)210-1, the purpose of
LGMs is to provide "information and instruction relating to
litigating procedures and methods," along with "standards and
criteria on issues and matters of significant interest to litigating
attorneys in the Office of Chief Counsel."

     The notice states that LGMs "are NOT to be released to the
public" and "are to be printed on blue paper to distinguish them from
nonprotected directives and to avoid inadvertent disclosure."

          ACTUARIAL EXAM COMMITTEE TO MEET JANUARY 8 AND 9.

     The Service has announced that the Joint Board for the
Enrollment of Actuaries Advisory Committee on Actuarial Examinations
will meet on January 8 and 9, 1996, to discuss topics and questions
for inclusion on future examinations in actuarial mathematics and
methodology. The committee will also review the November 1995
examination in order to make recommendations relative to it,
including the minimum acceptable passing score.

     The committee will meet in the Conference Room of the Office of
Director of Practice, Suite 600, 801 Pennsylvania Ave., NW,
Washington, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. each day. The portions of the
meeting dealing with future exam questions and the review of the
November exam will be closed to the public.

          NADER ASKS CEOs TO SUPPORT CORPORATE WELFARE CUTS.

     To usher in the New Year, Ralph Nader is asking CEOs who wrote
President Clinton and Congress calling for a balanced budget
agreement to identify and list federal subsidies and tax expenditures
that benefit their companies they would agree to forgo.

     In a letter he is sending to the 91 CEOs who signed the December
19 letter to budget negotiators, Nader pointed out that the
elimination of five corporate tax expenditures would provide an
additional $46.4 billion in revenue in fiscal year 1996. The consumer
advocate's five tax expenditure targets included accelerated
depreciation on equipment and buildings, reduced rates on the first
$10,000 of corporate taxable income, the exception to the source rule
for inventory property sales, the possessions tax credit, and the
expensing of research and development costs.

UNITED KINGDOM RENTAL INCOME OF NON-RESIDENTS

Regulations have been published setting out the details of the new
mechanisms for taxing rental income from UK property in the hands of
non-residents. The rules introduced in the 1995 Finance Act are
designed to bring the taxation of income in such circumstances within
the scope of the new self assessment system. They apply to rent and
other income paid from April 6, 1996.

Under the existing rules tenants, broadly, are obliged to withhold tax
at the rate of 25 per cent on gross rental income paid to non-resident
landlords. Informal arrangements were possible to pay on a net basis
where a UK agent was employed and an annual tax return was filed on
behalf of the non-resident landlord.

The new regulations set out in detail the obligations of non-resident
landlords, their agents and tenants.

Non-residents

The scheme applies to landlords whose "usual place of abode is outside
the UK". This unfortunate expression has been continued in the new
legislation and its precise meaning is unclear. Although in some
respects this corresponds broadly with residence for tax purposes, it
is not identical. A booklet issued by the Inland Revenue interprets the
expression as follows: It considers individuals who usually live
outside the UK as being covered by the scheme. This does not include
someone who is temporarily living outside the UK for six months or
less.

This does not include someone who is temporarily???? In relation to
companies, it covers those that have their main office or other place
of business outside the UK.

It notes that companies incorporated outside the UK will normally have
a usual place of abode outside the UK. Companies which are treated as
resident in the UK for tax purposes will not be regarded as having a
usual place of abode outside the UK. It also notes that the scheme does
not apply to the rental income of UK branches of non-resident
companies.

Trustees are regarded as having a usual place of abode outside the UK
if all the trustees have a usual place of abode outside the UK.

The Inland Revenue booklet notes that normally where a person is
treated as non-UK resident for tax purposes they will have a usual
place of abode outside the UK. It is clear however that the two
concepts are not viewed by the Inland Revenue as being identical.

Tax Base

The regulations require prescribed persons to deduct tax at the basic
rate from UK rental income, pay the tax quarterly to the Inland Revenue
and submit annual information returns setting out income expenses and
tax deducted. The basic rate from April 6, 1996 is 24 per cent.

Letting agents

Primary liability rests with letting agents. These are defined in the
legislation as persons who act on behalf of the non-resident in
connection with the management or administration of its UK property
rental business.

A statement by the Inland Revenue in a recent tax bulletin indicates
that they view this as a wide definition which includes those who act
in an informal manner such as friends or relatives as well as
professionals such as estate agents who collect rent. It does not cover
banks who merely provide accounts into which the income is paid.

In addition it applies to agents only if they handle or control UK
rental income on behalf of the non-resident. Therefore, accountants who
do no more than prepare accounts and tax returns or agents who merely
find tenants in return for fees without collecting any rent are not
included.

Persons who provide legal services are specifically excluded. This
covers solicitors recovering arrears of rent or receiving apportioned
rents in the course of a sale of property. If, however, solicitors
collect the first payment of rent after drawing up the lease they will
be covered because that is viewed as going beyond the provision of
legal advice or services.

Tenants

Where there is no letting agent the tenant must operate the scheme in
most cases. Tenants who pay rent of #100 per week or less are excluded
unless served with a notice from the Inland Revenue to operate the
scheme.

In either case the withholding person is required to register with the
Inland Revenue. Tax is paid to the Inland Revenue quarterly.

In the case of letting agents tax is deducted against:

- all Schedule A income, plus

- other Schedule A income paid away by the tenant in the quarter at the
letting agents direction, less

- expenses paid in the quarter which the agent can reasonably be
satisfied are allowable expenses of the non-resident landlord.

If expenses in the quarter exceed income received then the agent may
carry back surplus expenses to earlier quarters in the same year ended
at March 31 taking later quarters before earlier ones. Any surplus
expenses not used in this manner may be carried forward to future
quarters including those in a later year.

In the case of tenants, tax is calculated on:

- Schedule A income paid in the quarter to the non-resident landlord,
plus

- Schedule A income paid to a third party not being a payment they can
reasonably be satisfied is an allowable expense of the landlord.

Tenants must show the tax due on a quarterly return submitted with
payment within 30 days of the end of the quarter. In the case of
letting agents they will both return and pay in respect of all non-
resident landlords they represent. As tenants calculate tax on amounts
paid there is no carry back of surplus expenses.

Schedule A Business

Income from property underwent a significant reform in the 1995 Finance
Act (see FTWTR December 1994 page 228). Schedule A business essentially
comprises all property rental and the scheme covers income received by
or within the control of a letting agent or where there is no letting
agent, amounts paid by a tenant. It includes all annual profits or
gains arising from any land in the UK including income from the letting
or licensing of any furnished or unfurnished property and any premiums
chargeable as income rent charges ground rents etc.

Deductible expenses

The test for deductibility is now similar to that in relation to
trading activities. Expenses are those which the agent or tenant can be
reasonably satisfied are allowable in computing the profits of the non-
residents Schedule A business paid by the agent or the tenant. The
Inland Revenue proposes to publish guidance notes on this subject. If
the guidance notes are followed there will be no penalty for deducting
expenses which ultimately turn out not to be deductible.

They have warned where agents are unable to satisfy themselves whether
an expense is deductible, for example where there is insufficient
information about the purpose of the expenditure, they should not
deduct it.

Payment without deduction of tax

The regulations make provision for non-residents to receive rental
income without deduction of tax. Application may be made which when
approved will permit agents or tenants to pay without deduction of tax.
This may be allowed where the non-residents' UK tax affairs are up to
date or where they have never had any UK tax obligations or where they
do not expect to be liable to UK income tax (for example where expenses
will likely exceed income).

In each case they must undertake to comply with all their UK
obligations including filing of all returns and paying tax due on time.

The Inland Revenue will give reasons for any refusal and an appeal may
be made against such a refusal. Agents and tenants will be notified of
the obligation to resume withholding if the approval is withdrawn.

TRANSFER PRICING - UNITED STATES COST SHARING REGULATIONS

Code S482 was amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to require that
consideration for the use of intangible property transferred in a
controlled transaction must be commensurate with the income generated
by the item of intangible property. Congress did not intend to preclude
multinational groups from entering into bona fide research and
development cost sharing arrangements as an appropriate method of
allocating income attributable to intangibles among related parties.

The IRS issued a study of intercompany pricing in 1988 known as "the
White Paper". The White Paper suggested that most bona fide cost
sharing arrangements should have certain provisions.

For example, cost sharing arrangements should cover all research within
a particular three-digit SIC code, most participants should be assigned
exclusive geographic rights in developed intangibles (and should be
able to predict benefits and divide costs accordingly), and marketing
intangibles should be excluded from bona fide cost sharing
arrangements.

The IRS issued proposed cost sharing regulations in 1992.

The final regulations issued in December 1995 define a cost sharing
arrangement as an agreement for sharing costs in proportion to
reasonably anticipated benefits from the individual exploitation of
interests in the intangibles that are developed. Although a taxpayer
must satisfy certain formal requirements to contend that a cost sharing
arrangement exists, the IRS may apply the cost sharing rules to any
arrangement that in substance constitutes a cost sharing arrangement.
For a US-based company, this could result in a loss of R&D deductions.

The final regulations provide that neither a qualified cost sharing
arrangement nor an arrangement treated in substance as such, will be
treated as a partnership. Moreover, a foreign participant will not be
treated as being engaged in a trade or business within the US solely by
virtue of its participation in such an arrangement.

The final regulations emphasize the move away from a strict use of
numeric ratios in measuring the sharing of costs with the anticipated
benefits. Thus, for example, no allocation will be made with respect to
a qualified cost sharing arrangement, except to make each controlled
participant's share of the intangible development costs equal to its
share of reasonably anticipated benefits.

Similarly, in listing the requirements for qualification, the final
regulations provide that the arrangement must provide a method to
calculate each controlled participant's share of intangible development
costs based on factors that can reasonably be expected to reflect
anticipated benefits. The new standard is intended to ensure that cost
sharing arrangements will not be disregarded by the IRS as long as the
factors upon which an estimate of benefits was based were reasonable,
even if the estimate proves inaccurate.

As under the proposed regulations, a cost sharing arrangement must be
set forth in writing and contain a number of specified provisions,
including the interest that each controlled participant will have
received in any intangibles developed, referred to as "covered
intangibles". If the research results in the development of intangible
property that was not foreseen at the inception of the cost sharing
arrangement, the property is also included as a covered intangible.

The final regulations permit participation by unrelated persons,
referred to as "uncontrolled participants", in a cost sharing
agreement. Controlled taxpayers may be participants, referred to as
"controlled participants", provided that they use or reasonably expect
to use covered intangibles in the active conduct of a trade or
business. An entity that chiefly provides services as a contract
researcher may not be a controlled participant. However, nothing
prevents a service entity such as a contract researcher from furnishing
research and development services to the members of a qualified cost
sharing arrangement in return for appropriate consideration.

As under the proposed regulations, the activity of another person may
be attributed to a controlled taxpayer for purposes of meeting the
active conduct requirement. However, the standard has changed. In the
proposed regulations, the controlled taxpayer merely had to bear the
risk and receive the benefits of the attributed activity. Under the
final regulations the attribution will be made only where the
controlled taxpayer exercises substantial managerial and operational
control over the attributed activities. Thus, a shell entity is
unlikely to qualify for participation.

The final regulations define intangible development costs as operating
expenses other than depreciation and amortization expense, and an arm's
length charge for tangible property made available to cost sharing
arrangements. As under the proposed regulations, the IRS may adjust the
pool of costs shared in order to properly reflect costs that relate to
the intangible development area.

The final regulations define anticipated benefits as additional income
generated or costs saved by the use of covered intangibles. The pool of
benefits may also be adjusted in order to properly reflect benefits
that relate to the intangible development area. Anticipated benefits of
uncontrolled participants will be excluded.

A share of reasonably anticipated benefits will be determined using the
most reliable estimate of benefits. This rule echoes the best method
rule for determining the most reliable measure of an arm's length
result under the substantive transfer pricing regulations. The
reliability of an estimate of benefits principally depends on two
factors; the reliability of the basis for measuring benefits used and
the reliability of the projections used.

The cost to operating income ratio used in the proposed regulations to
check the reasonableness of an effort to share costs in proportion to
anticipated benefits is deleted from the final regulations. Instead, an
allocation of costs or income may be made if the taxpayer did not use
the most reliable estimate of benefits. That determination will depend
on the facts and circumstances of each case. The most reliable basis
for measuring anticipated benefits must be used and the measurement
basis must be consistent for all controlled participants. The
regulations provide that benefits may be measured directly or
indirectly.

In addition, regardless of whether a direct or indirect basis of
measurement is employed, it may be necessary to make adjustments to
account for material differences in the activities that controlled
participants perform in connection with exploitation of covered
intangibles, such as between wholesale and retain distribution.
Indirect bases for measuring benefits may include units of production,
sales, operating profit and any other factor that bears a relationship
to benefits.

The final regulations provide that projections used to estimate
benefits must include a projection of the time over which benefits will
be received and a projection of the benefits anticipated for each year
in the period. A significant divergence between projected and actual
benefit shares may indicate that the projections were not reliable. A
significant divergence is defined as divergence in excess of 20 per
cent between projected and actual benefit shares.

If there is a significant divergence, which is not due to an
unforeseeable event, the IRS may use actual benefits as the most
reliable basis for measuring benefits. Conversely, no allocation will
be made based on a divergence that is not considered significant as
long as the estimate is made using the most reliable basis for
measuring benefits. For purposes of the 20 per cent test, all non US
controlled participants are treated as a single controlled participant
in order that a divergence by a foreign controlled participant with a
very small share of the total costs will not necessarily trigger an
allocation.

A taxpayer receiving a cost sharing payment must reduce its research
and development expense. The final regulations adopt a net approach to
foster simplicity and preserve the character of items actually incurred
by a participant to the extent not reimbursed.

Any payment that in substance constitutes a cost sharing payment will
be treated as such, regardless of its characterization under foreign
law. This rule is intended to enable foreign entities to participate in
cost sharing arrangements with US controlled participants even if
foreign law does not recognise cost sharing.

KATZ COMMISSION ON TAX REFORM

The Katz Commission of Inquiry into tax reform (see FTWTR January 1995
p3) released their Third Interim Report in December 1995.

The thrust of the First Interim Report was that the Revenue
administration had to be restructured to ensure effective revenue
collection and to make meaningful tax reform possible.

In an announcement at the end of 1995, the Government accepted most of
the Commission's recommendations on administrative reform. These
include the establishment of a combined Inland Revenue and Customs
authority with a greater degree of independence than before. The
effectiveness of collection is expected to improve almost immediately.
The longer term benefit will only be realised over several years.
Several recommendations are not final in this report, although
important indications of future developments are recorded.

Retirement Savings

The most comprehensive recommendation in the Third Interim Report is
for retirement funds to be brought into the tax net. This deviates from
the decades long South African formula of deductible contributions to
pension funds, exempt build-up in the funds, and taxability on payout.
The Commission recommended a 30 per cent flat rate tax on normal
taxable income in the funds. The recommendations are motivated by two
considerations. First, assets of some R500 billion, an appreciable part
of the economy, are controlled through these funds; over the years this
has brought about a massive, structural inducement to arbitrage between
the taxable and exempt sectors of the economy. Second, the retirement
industry has enjoyed a degree of fiscal privilege which is viewed as
incompatible with other priorities in a democratic society.

The current tax exemption for payments from public sector funds should
disappear. Differences in tax treatment between pension, provident, and
benefit funds are to be removed, especially those concerning
deductibility of contributions. Limitations on deductibility are to be
eased. Lump-sum payouts are to be taxed at progressive rates with
reference to a capital sum; thereafter pensions, whether in lump sum or
through annuity, will be untaxed. Transitional measures are proposed to
ensure that no vested rights are affected. The Commission has expressed
the view that at least some of the additional tax collected should be
applied towards relief in the income tax area.

Business Tax Issues

Corporate profits - The report expresses a preference over the longer
term for an imputation type system, but finds that current
administrative capacity and the likely lesser sophistication of an
emerging corporate sector militate against real progress at this time.
The current system of a Secondary Tax on Companies (STC) should
therefore be retained; however, the STC rate of 25 per cent on
distributed profits has a distortionary effect and should be reduced to
something like 15 per cent.

Several more detailed measures are proposed to streamline the STC. None
affect the basic principle that STC is an additional tax on companies
upon distribution and dividends are untaxed in the hands of recipients.

The Commission noted the acceptance by the UK authorities of the STC as
a creditable tax for treaty purposes and an apparent acceptance by the
Japanese authorities that the tax will qualify for foreign tax credit
purposes.

The Commission took cognisance of the fact that the STC is not
currently enforced against foreign businesses operating in South Africa
in the form of a branch. After rejecting a branch profits tax the
Commission recommended that this tax be abolished for branches rather
than to be retained and not enforced.

Group Taxation - South Africa currently has no general group tax
system. Each corporate entity is regarded as a separate taxpayer. The
Commission strongly criticised this and recommends introduction of an
elective group basis of taxation. In view of expected administrative
deficiencies, it proposes a gradual introduction.

Initially a group will be defined as involving only 100 per cent
affiliations (employee shares excepted). Losses carried forward into
the new system will not be allowed against group profits. Initially
only current year losses will be dealt with on a group basis. The
intention is to extend the degree of full consolidation group
treatment.

Share Incentives - The Commission did not favour sweeping incentives to
encourage employee share ownership. It did recommend a system of
deferral on the fringe benefit tax consequences of employer assisted
finance for the acquisition of employer shares. It also recommended
that, proper dealers apart, it should be made clear that employees will
not be taxed on gains on employer shares.

Anti Avoidance - The current general anti-avoidance provision in the
Income Tax Act (Section 103) provides the taxpayer with two main
defences - namely that the transactions in question did not have a tax
advantage as sole or main objective and that they did not create rights
and obligations abnormal within the relevant circumstances. The latter
test has been increasingly interpreted by the courts as subjective, to
a point where it became very difficult to attack certain avoidance
schemes. The Commission proposed that the abnormality test should be
scrapped in favour of a bona fide business purpose test.

This will apply in all business situations. Private family transactions
will continue to be governed by a normality requirement. The Commission
suggested that the provisions should not apply where it could be shown
that the transaction would not result in misuse of the Income Tax Act.

Other Levies - The Commission strongly criticised the current Regional
Services Council Levies (low-rate levies on payroll and turnover), but
stopped short of recommending their abolition, mainly because their
fate could best be decided by the Financial and Fiscal Commission - a
body charged with adjudicating funding as between the various
provinces.

It favoured abolishing the financial services levy on financial
institutions in favour of including all fee based financial services
under the VAT net.

It recommended abolition of the marketable securities tax on share
transfers on the stock exchange, and similar stamp duties on other
transactions.

Other Matters

Capital Gains Tax - The Commission recommended against a capital gains
tax at this time. The benefits would not justify the cost, effort and
complexity; such a tax is not a priority. The Commission did recommend
that, should a capital gains tax ever be considered, assets would have
to be assigned a benchmark date value which would then not be subject
to the tax.

Instead, the Commission recommended continuation of the donations tax
and estate duty, although they could be merged into a new capital
transfer tax.

Land Tax - Study into the feasibility of a land tax continues. Insofar
as South Africa already taxes municipal property on a local government
level, such a tax will mainly affect rural land. The Commission has
already indicated that a land tax on the national level would be very
unlikely, but scope remains for such a tax on a local or regional
level. Further recommendations will be made in due course.

Taxpayer rights - The Commission proposed that the administration
articulate certain basic rights for taxpayers. In its First Interim
Report it has listed a number of provisions in the current law which
would probably fall foul of the Interim Constitution regarding basic
rights and administrative fairness.

In this report they proposed a Statement of Taxpayer Rights. This
statement will not constitute a legal Bill of Rights.

Implementing these principles will be a function of specific
legislation, Codes of Practice, intervention by the existing Public
Protector and a tax specific ombudsman.

EUROPEAN UNION: TRANSIT CHARGE UNDER PRIVATE CONTRACT

The European Court of Justice has ruled on the question as to whether a
transit charge payable under a private contract has equivalent effect
to a customs duty and is therefore illegal under European law in Eduard
de Bois et Fils SA and General Cargo Services v Garanor Exploitation
SA.

Garanor managed an international road station and brought proceedings
against two customers for non-payment of a contractually agreed charge
known as a "taxe de passage" (transit charge). The appellants were
forwarding agents and recognised as such by the customs authority. In
addition to paying rent to the respondent for premises at an
international road station where customs clearance operations are
normally completed, they paid a flat rate transit charge for each
vehicle in international transit calculated on the basis of monthly
returns by the appellants.

The charge was intended to cover expenses of the respondent in respect
of the performance by the customs and veterinary services of their
tasks as providers of services in the public interest.

The Court ruled that the charge is illegal under European law if it is
designed to compensate a private undertaking for bearing costs arising
from the performance of services in the public interest even if they
have not been imposed by the state but arise from an agreement
concluded by that undertaking with its customers.

EUROPEAN UNION: VAT ON RESEARCH PROGRAMMES

In response to a Parliamentary question, Commissioner Monti has
confirmed that under the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of
the European Community as reflected in Article 15(10) of the Sixth VAT
Directive, goods and services supplied to the Commission are exempt
from VAT, either directly or by means of a subsequent refund of tax.

He said that the Commission is anxious to ensure that organisations
which participate in Community funded research and technological
development programmes receive equal treatment under the common VAT
system. It will therefore monitor the situation carefully taking
appropriate measures as necessary.

The question raised concern that if individual universities and
research organisations have to reclaim VAT from the British Government,
they will find it almost impossible to do so if the Commission does not
intend to change the policy of globally claiming VAT on research
programmes from member state governments.

EUROPEAN UNION: DELAY IN DEFINITIVE VAT REGIME LIKELY

In response to a question in the European parliament the taxation
commissioner Mr Mario Monti has refused to give an assurance that the
definitive system for VAT will enter into force on January 1, 1997 as
stated in article 28 of the sixth VAT directive.

The directive was amended in 1991 to introduce a transitional
arrangement for a period of four years which is to expire on December
31, 1996. A final or definitive system was to enter into force
thereafter which was proposed to embrace the original system. This
envisages tax imposed in the country of origin of goods or services
only with input tax being claimed by business customers in the country
of destination based on the tax charged in the country of origin.

The transitional arrangements are however automatically extended until
the definitive system enters into effect.

Reasons given by the commission for the delay are the amount of work
done and the recent enlargement of the EU. They view it as unlikely
that the deadline will be met.

BELGIUM: WEALTH TAX HINT

Mr Elio di Rupo, the deputy prime minister of Belgium, has raised the
possibility of introducing a wealth tax and a "generalised social
levy", as a way of taking some of the pain out of spending cuts in this
year's budget.

Belgium already has high tax rates, but the government needs to raise
revenues to plug the budget deficit.

Mr di Rupo said: "The problem of social security will not be solved
only acting on the spending side and asking exclusively for an effort
from those who benefit from various social benefits".

FRANCE: FINANCE AMENDMENT LAW 1996

The Finance Amendment Law finally adopted by Parliament on December 21,
1995 has been submitted to the Constitutional Council ("Conseil
Constitutionnel"). Its entry into force depends on publication in the
"Journal Officiel" and the approval of the Constitutional Council.

Simplified Declaration System

Small or medium companies may be taxed under a special regime called
the simplified declaration tax system. Such companies may keep
simplified accounts and report their income on a simplified return. The
scope of application of this system has changed.

Previously, companies with annual turnover not exceeding Fr 3,800,000
for sales and lodging or Fr 1,100,000 for services, qualified for the
simplified system.

Under the new law, the thresholds are increased to Fr 5,000,000 for
sales and lodging and Fr 1,500,000 for services. The simplified regime
will now concern 60,000 to 70,000 companies representing 8 per cent of
those taxed under the normal regime.

The thresholds first apply to 1995 personal income tax, to corporate
income tax for tax years closed at December 31, 1995 and from January
1, 1996 for VAT.

VAT

The new law mainly enacts the second VAT Simplification Directive
95/7/EEC of April 10, 1995.

The transposition concerns operations of jobbing, ("travail a facon")
which are now treated as services; the territoriality of work and
expert evaluation on personal tangible property and transportation of
approach; the basis of taxation on import; suspensive customs regimes
and export procedure by sales notes.

Other VAT provisions which do not derive from the second simplification
Directive include a new simplified form of tax representation for
certain operations where no VAT is due in France.

Property

According to article 1115 of the French Tax Code (CGI), the purchase of
property by professional real property dealers is subject to
registration duty reduced from 18.6 per cent to 0.6 per cent if the
dealer undertakes to sell the property within four years from the date
of acquisition.

Because of the crisis in the property market, the 1992 finance
amendment bill extended the deadline for sale to December 31, 1996 for
property acquired before January 1, 1993.

The new law extends this for a further two years to December 31, 1998.
It also introduces a reduced tax rate for sales made between January 1,
1999 and December 31, 2001 as follows:

- sales in 1999 - 75 per cent
- sales in 2000 - 50 per cent
- sales in 2001 - 25 per cent

The tax is due in the month following the sale.

Sales benefitting from reduced tax are not subject to the 6 per cent
additional duty. This is normally due by dealers who do not comply with
their undertaking to sell within 4 years.

Interest on late payment at 0.75 per cent per month, remains. It
applies from expiry of the period during which the sale should have
been made.

Contribution of property realised from January 1, 1996 is not to be
considered as a sale for the application of article 1115 of the CGI.

Professional Income

Under article 93 of the CGI, the taxation of professional income is in
principle determined on a cash basis. Professional income comprises non
commercial income of professionals such as doctors or lawyers.

However, the tax administration accepts the accrual basis at the
taxpayers' request.

The accrual system option is now provided by law and must be exercised
before February 1 of a given year.

FRANCE: TAX LAUNCH DELAYED

The French government, under pressure from leaders of its own centre-
right majority, postponed for a month the launch of a new tax designed
to wipe out welfare deficits. "The contribution for the reimbursement
of the social deficit will apply from February 1, 1996" instead of
January 1, the Labour Ministry said.

A former budget minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, a member of the ruling
RPR party, and a centrist former defence minister, Mr Francois Leotard,
had urged the government to delay the new 0.5 per cent income tax for a
year, saying the economy was too fragile to sustain it.

GERMANY: TREATY OVERRIDE

German bilateral tax treaties which eliminate German taxation on
foreign enterprises have allowed activities in Germany both without tax
and the bother of tax formalities. In the last few years domestic law
amendments have changed the whole situation.

Section 50d of the income tax act (Einkommensteurergesetz, Estg) has
been amended three times in the last three years. It now requires
payments subject to German withholding tax to be made without regard to
any tax treaty or the provisions implementing the EU parent-subsidiary
directive. The foreign creditor may only claim a refund of tax withheld
if he can prove that he is entitled to the treaty or EU benefit. Under
certain circumstances the debtor may apply to the competent authority
(the Bundesame fur Finanzen) for approval not to withhold tax.

If the foreign creditor is a company, the tax authorities may deny it
the exemption if the shareholders personally would not be entitled to
the tax exemption and if there are no economically convincing reasons
for using the company and the company has no commercial activities of
its own.

The importance of these provisions has grown because obligations to
withhold have been broadened. Previously, only licence fees, dividends
and similar profits were subject to withholding. Now the proceeds from
the sales of enterprises, real property and patents are subject to
withholding. The tax authorities require withholding on gross payments
rather than net profits.

These rules and the approach of the tax authorities have been widely
regarded as not conforming to treaty obligations and EU law. In
particular, treaty exemption of profits from commercial activities and
the parent/subsidiary directive's abolition of withholding taxes seem
contrary to the provisions.

The tax authorities emphasise that the rules and their application are
only onerous for German debtors and therefore do not discriminate
against foreign enterprises.

A number of cases have now focused on the issues. The first important
decision of the Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) was published in
1995. In a further decision in 1995 the Federal Tax Court has confirmed
and made clear its position.

The Federal tax court did not discuss the conflict with treaties but
pointed out that treaties are implemented by national legislation.
National legislation may be amended and overturned by further
legislation. This is what happened in the case of section 50d Estg
according to the Federal Tax Court. The consequences for contracting
states may be discussed between the governments but are not to be
regarded by the court according to German doctrine on public
international law.

In German tax law the practical approach has been different. It is
assumed that domestic tax law is not intended to infringe international
law. Domestic law and treaties are therefore to be interpreted so that
treaties could prevail over national law or that domestic law not be
read as contradicting a treaty. This is supported by section 2 of the
Act on Tax Procedure (Abgabenordunung), which gives a provision derived
from a tax treaty precedence before a provision of purely national law.

The latest court decision overturns the traditional method of
interpretation and will encourage the treaty overriding legislation
which Germany has recently begun to enact.

The decision only deals with a question under a bilateral treaty.
Conformity with EU law still has to be discussed.

GERMANY: JOBS THROUGH TAX BREAKS

Germany plans to encourage new business creation and give tax
concessions to small and medium sized enterprises as part of a
programme to boost employment, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance
minister, said on December 10, 1995.

"We are doing everything to encourage business start-ups and we want a
sensible company tax reform," he said in an interview with the
Financial Times.

As part of a "symmetrical finance policy" that reduces the government
deficit and taxes in parallel, Mr Waigel said he wanted to get rid of
Germany's wealth tax and the local trading capital tax, a levy that
taxes companies even when they do not make a profit.

He also wanted to blunt the impact of local profit taxes on small and
medium sized companies by lowering initial tax rates and giving
concessions to companies building up financial reserves.

"The government does its duty if it consolidates the budget and tries
to cut those taxes and levies within its power," he said. He denied
rumours that he was seeking to increase value added tax: "I do not have
such plans."

ITALY: NEW YEAR'S EVE DECREE

A Law Decree (which must be converted into Law by Parliament within
sixty days of its entry into force) was enacted by the government on
January 30, 1995. Tax measures in the decree complete those provided in
the 1996 Budget and are expected to ensure an increase in the State's
revenue of Lire 5,285 billion, of which Lire 3,800 billion will be
obtained by introducing new taxes and by extending the deadline of the
mass tax settlement while Lire 1,485 billion by reducing public
spending.

The mass tax settlement, which was previously applicable only with
regard to returns filed in respect of the tax years 1987 to 1993 (see
FTWTR August 1995 page 146; October 1995 p. 185) has now been extended
(with new conditions) also to years 1994 and 1995.

The cigarette price is increased by Lire 200. Excise duty rates on
spirits are increased by approximately 8 per cent. Excise duty
regarding "unleaded" petrol is increased by Lire 22.

Stamp-duties are increased from Lire 15,000 to 20,000 while stamp
duties at a fixed rate on invoices, receipts, documents etc. are
increased from Lire 2,000 to Lire 2,500.

Highway tolls are increased on average by 2.6 per cent.

NETHERLANDS: INTEREST DEDUCTION FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION

The Undersecretary of Finance has published the policy on the
deductibility of costs incurred with respect to a minority
participation qualifying for the participation exemption.

The participation exemption excludes from corporate income tax both
dividends and capital gains in respect of a qualifying participation
(article 13 of the 1969 Corporate Income Tax Act).

The shareholder will often incur costs with respect to the management
and financing of that participation. According to article 13, paragraph
1, these costs are not deductible, unless the owner can demonstrate
that they contribute to profits which are taxable in the Netherlands.

This rule may prove to be a serious problem for a Netherlands company
which acquires a minority participation in a concern which is active
both in the Netherlands and in other countries. The company may have
difficulties acquiring the information required to demonstrate that the
costs it incurred with respect to said participation contribute to
profits taxable in the Netherlands.

To accommodate companies which find themselves in this situation, the
Undersecretary of Finance recently stated that these costs are
considered to be incurred with respect to profits taxable in the
Netherlands if the minority participation has a "sufficient"
substantial relation with the Netherlands. This may be the case if the
Netherlands' business activities of the company in which the
participation is held are "material" in relation to the total business
activities of the concern of which that company is a part.

According to the Undersecretary, costs incurred with respect to a
minority participation will be deductible if:

- the company in which a minority participation is acquired is a
resident of the Netherlands and conducts business activities in the
Netherlands. This includes Netherlands resident subsidiaries, in which
that company has an interest of at least 25 per cent;

- the business activities conducted in the Netherlands are material in
relation to the whole of business activities conducted by the concern
of which the Netherlands companies are a part;

- the acquiring company, together with related companies, does not own
a controlling interest (25 per cent or more) in the participation.

The meaning of "material" is undefined since, depending on the specific
circumstances of a case, different factors may be decisive with regard
to the question whether the business activities have a sufficient
relation with the Netherlands. However, the Undersecretary did indicate
that, although no fixed percentage can be assumed, 5 or 10 per cent may
be considered material.

Given the important role of the participation exemption the letter has
important practical implications. Unfortunately, since the "material"
criterion is not explained in detail, it is not quite certain what the
exact range of approval is.

NETHERLANDS: CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE

Until January 1, 1996, Netherlands corporate income tax was levied at
40 per cent on profits up to Dfl 100,000, and 35 per cent on the
excess. The 40 per cent rate will be gradually reduced. In 1996, it
will be 37 per cent, in 1997, 36 per cent and in 1998, it will be 35
per cent.

Thus from 1998, corporate income tax will be levied at 35 per cent
rate.

The Polish Constitutional Tribunal ruled on December 28, 1995 that the
tax amendments to the Personal Taxation Law introducing six tax bands
for the 1996 taxation year (see FTWTR December 1995, page 229) were
unconstitutional as they did not provide the required vacatio legis.
Hence, the tax rates will remain for the 1996 taxation year as follows:

UNITED KINGDOM: PENSION SCHEMES - INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS

The Inland Revenue have issued a revised practice note relating to
pension schemes in the international context.

The circumstances in which employees overseas can remain members of a
UK approved pension scheme have been amended. The results are more
favourable and represent several relaxations. In particular,
individuals can remain overseas for periods of up to 10 years or longer
with agreement. They need not be under the control of the UK employer
and may also apply where the initial employment is with the UK branch
of a non-resident employer.

It is also intended that the requirement that the employee must have
initially worked in the UK be relaxed on an experimental basis.

Overseas pension technical changes have been made in relation to the
circumstances in which an employee from overseas can obtain
corresponding relief for UK tax purposes in respect of membership of a
foreign pension scheme.

In particular, the recognition of foreign schemes as corresponding to
UK arrangements for multi-national groups in tax havens are limited to
circumstances where it is legally impossible to establish a scheme for
the foreign emoluments employee in the jurisdiction of location or
where it is a scheme for a multi-national group to which all expatriate
(or at least the career expatriate) employees belong.

Individuals who are granted corresponding relief under the previous
practice will not be subject to the new practice on any future claim to
relief in respect of the same scheme.

UK/Ireland

The statement notes that the reciprocal approval agreement between the
UK and Ireland has been discontinued although relief may be available
pursuant to the protocol to the tax treaty between the two countries.

UNITED KINGDOM: COMPANY RESIDENCE

The Special Commissioners have recently considered the residence of two
offshore companies in the case of Untelrab Limited and Others v
McGregor. The principle that a non-UK incorporated company is resident
where its central management and control is exercised is based on a
handful of decisions the most recent of which is nearly 40 years old
and the majority of which are over 80 years old.

The two companies in question were subsidiaries of a UK resident parent
company. One was formed for the purpose of receiving the purchase price
when the UK parent purchased a company and assumed its debts.

Two of the directors were resident in Bermuda and were executives in a
company which managed the day-to-day affairs of the offshore company. A
third was a Jersey resident solicitor. Board meetings were held two or
three times a year in Bermuda attended by the two Bermuda directors. No
advance notice of board meetings was given and no agenda was circulated
although the Jersey director was kept informed of what was decided.

The company's business was the making of loans to other members of the
parent company's group at the request of the parent company.

The second company remained dormant for some five years and thereafter
participated in the financial dealings of the first. It was managed by
accountants in Guernsey. Two of the directors were residents of Sark
where the board meetings were held.

The Inland Revenue argued that the boards of both subsidiaries merely
rubber stamped decisions which had been made by the parent and had not
addressed their minds as to what they were being asked to do. They did
not really make decisions. While documentation was made in Bermuda the
decisions were taken in London.

They also argued that if, on the facts, a local board submitted to
direction from outside then that was central management and controlled
from outside. It was insufficient to go through the forms of corporate
governing where in fact decisions purportedly taken by a subsidiaries
board were taken at the direction of a parent. They argued that it
could not sensibly be said that the boards were making the decisions
and that in reality they were taken by the parent.

The Commissioners identified the following principles based on existing
cases:

- The Company was resident where the directors met and transacted their
business and exercised the powers conferred upon them;

- If the directors met in two places the Company's business was where
its real business was carried on and the real business was carried on
where the central management and control actually abided;

- A determination as to whether a case fell within that rule was purely
a question of fact to be determined by a scrutiny of the course of
business and trading;

- The actual management and not the place where a company ought to be
managed determined its residence;

- It was an exceptional case for a parent company to exert control for
its subsidiaries as a parent usually operated through the boards of its
subsidiaries;

- Although a board might do what it was told to it did not follow that
the control and management of the company lay with another so long as
the board exercised their discretion when coming to decisions and would
have refused to carry out an improper or unwise transaction; and

- When deciding the issue one should stand back from the detail and
consider the picture which the whole of the evidence presented.

On these principles the Commissioners found that although the
subsidiaries were complacent to do the will of the parent they did
actually function in giving effect to the parents' wishes. Proposals
were discussed at board meetings and decisions were made by the
directors in the best interests of the Company. They would have refused
to carry out any proposal which was improper or unreasonable. The
parent did not control the board in the exercise of their powers. It
could have taken steps to remove the directors but could not control
them in their conduct of the business. The companies were therefore
resident in Bermuda and Sark respectively.

UNITED KINGDOM: WITHHOLDING TAX RATES

The Inland Revenue has issued a press release to clarify the rates of
tax withheld at source following the budget of November 29, 1995. The
basic rate of income tax was reduced from 25 to 24 per cent. Generally,
withholding has been at the basic rate. However certain rates of tax on
passive income have also been reduced to 20 per cent. As a result the
principal withholding tax rates from April 6, 1996 will be as in the
table below.

20% rate

Payment

- Interest paid by banks, building societies and other deposit-takers

- Interest on UK Government and other securities

- Interest distributions by authorised unit trusts

- Other annual interest payable under deduction of tax

- Purchased life annuities (income element)

- Certain payments made by paying and collecting agents

24% rate

- Annual payments (including charges on income, such as payments under
deeds of covenant to charities, and distributions by unauthorised unit
trusts)

- Other annuities (where PAYE does not apply)

- Rents paid to non-resident landlords

- Patent royalties

- Payments to foreign entertainers and sportsmen (subject to any
application for a reduced tax payments)

Income treated as paid under deduction of tax

Certain income is treated as though tax has been deducted from it but
the tax is not repayable. From April 6, 1996 tax will be treated as
deducted or paid at the following rates:

20% rate

- Foreign income dividends

- Stock dividends

- Loans to participators which are waived

24% rate

- Certain chargeable event gains.

UNITED STATES: BUDGET BATTLE CONTINUES

The philosophical differences between the Administration and the
majority Republicans in the House and Senate continue. In December, the
President vetoed the balanced budget bill passed by both Houses of
Congress. The bill contained major tax reform proposals. Subsequently,
the Administration offered its seven year balanced budget proposal,
relying on significant tax increases to offset middle class tax relief.

Included among the revenue raisers are the Administration's
expatriation tax as modified by the Senate (all gains of expatriates
would be taxed upon expatriation, rather than the proposal adopted by
Congress involving a 10 year extension of US tax jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of US assets), and the foreign grantor trust
proposals. Other revenue raisers in the Administration's plan include:

- A reduction in the dividends received deduction available to
corporations, from 70 per cent to 50 per cent thereby increasing tax on
intercompany dividends from a maximum rate of 10.5 per cent to a
maximum rate of 17.5 per cent.

- Treatment of preferred stock as boot in corporate organizations and
reorganizations, forcing recognition of gain on the receipt of
preferred shares as consideration for the transfer of property.
Conditions similar to those that appear in the anti-conduit regulations
would have to be met for the provision to apply. Those conditions
establish a standard under which an equity transaction has
characteristics of debt.

-  The conversion of a C Corporation to S Corporation status would be a
taxable event for any corporation that has a value in excess of US $5
million.

- Limiting replacement personal property received in like kind
exchanged to property located in the US.

-  Limiting the net operating loss carryback period to one year, but
extending the carryover period to 20 years.

- Creating a new class of Subpart F income for notional principal
contracts and including income from the lending of securities as
Subpart F income.

- Treating certain corporate redemptions that would be afforded
favourable dividend treatment in the hands of a corporation under
existing law as capital gain transactions. For a corporation, capital
gains are subject to higher tax rates than intercompany dividends.

- Limiting interest expense deductions for corporations in connection
with the issuance of debt which (i) had a maturity in excess of 40
years or (ii) provides for the payment of interest in the form of
shares of the corporation.

In addition, the Administration proposes to loosen the rules applicable
to captive insurance companies so that premiums paid to captives will
be treated as insurance if more than 50 per cent of the captive's net
premium income relates to the insurance of risks of unrelated persons.
The Administration also proposes to modify the rules applicable to
domestic corporations operating in Puerto Rico and claiming benefits
under Code S936.

UNITED STATES: REGULATIONS FOR PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIPS

Ordinarily, a partnership is not considered to be a separate entity for
purposes of computing taxable income. Rather, under the aggregate
theory of partnerships, a partnership is treated as a flow through to
its partners, who are generally deemed to receive the income and incur
the expenses booked by the partnership. Nonetheless, in some
circumstances, a partnership may be treated by financial markets as the
equivalent of a publicly traded corporation.

In 1987, Code S7704 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted to provide
corporate treatment for publicly traded partnerships. This means that a
separate level of tax is due from the partnership and the partnership
loses its status as a pass-through to its partners. Existing entities
were given a 10 year carryover before the new rules were to become
effective.

Under the statute, a partnership is a publicly traded partnership if
interests in it are traded on an established securities market or are
readily tradeable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent
thereof. Final regulations have been adopted implementing the statute.

Under the final regulations, an established securities market includes
a national securities exchange registered under section 6 of the
Securities Exchange Act 1934 or a national securities exchange which is
regulated under the laws of its place or organization.

Partnership interests are readily tradeable on a secondary market or the
substantial equivalent. If, under all the facts and circumstances, the
partners are readily able to buy, sell or exchange their partnership
interests in a manner that is comparable economically, to trading on an
established securities market.

The regulations contain a number of safe harbour exceptions. Under the
first safe harbour, certain transactions are expressly disregarded in
determining whether partnership interests are readily tradeable on a
secondary market. These transactions include traders in which carryover
basis exists, either from a transferor of the partnership interest or
resulting from a distribution from a partnership, transfers at death,
transfers among family members, the issuance of partnership interests
in exchange for cash, property or services, distributions from a
qualified retirement plan or by an individual retirement account.

Second, a transfer that is pursuant to a redemption agreement not
otherwise described above will be disregarded in determining whether
partnership interests are readily tradeable on a secondary market or
the substantial equivalent thereof if certain conditions are in place
to prevent the redemption and a potential issuance of a comparable
interest in a transaction that follows closely in time.

Under the third safe harbour, transfers effected through a qualified
matching service which match lists of intended sellers and potential
purchasers will be disregarded.

Finally, private placements are disregarded. To constitute a private
placement under the final regulations, all partnership interests must
have been issued in a transaction that was not required to be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the partnership must
not have more than 100 partners at any time during the tax year.

The final regulations provide rules of application for the foregoing
provisions. If a transaction does not fall within a specific safe
harbour, the transaction is not presumed to be a trade of a partnership
interest on an exchange or on a secondary market or the equivalent
thereof. Thus, no presumption arises as to the effect of the
transaction. Taxpayers are free to argue that the particular facts and
circumstances relating to a transfer of a partnership interest are not
sufficient to cause the interest from being sold on the substantial
equivalent of a secondary market. If the sum of the partnership capital
or profits interests transferred during the year, exclusive of
transactions covered by any of the safe harbours, does not exceed 2 per
cent of the total interests in partnership capital or profits, the
partnership is not a publicly traded partnership. Finally, if the
general partner and related entities own more than 10 per cent of the
capital or profits interests at any time during the year, all
percentage computations are to be made exclusive of the interests owned
by the general partners and related entities.

UNITED STATES: NEW SOURCE REGULATIONS PROPOSED

The source of income is an important concept under US tax law. For US
entities, the source rules control the computation of the foreign tax
credit limitation. For foreign entities, the source rule frequently is
crucial in determining whether the US has jurisdiction to tax. Code
S863(b) controls the source of income that arises when a company
engages in income producing activities in more than one location.

In December, the IRS proposed revised regulations under Code S863(b).

Under the proposal, taxpayers are to use the apportionment method to
determine the source of the income when inventory is manufactured in
one country and sold in another country. Under this method, 50 per cent
of the income is sourced in the place where the sale occurs and 50 per
cent is sourced in the place where the production assets are located.
The existing regulations are not limited to production assets and the
reference in the proposed regulations reflects a targeted approach to
the types of assets that are taken into account in the computation. A
production asset is any tangible or intangible asset owned by the
taxpayer and directly used to produce the inventory in issue. Excluded
are accounts receivable, marketing intangibles, transportation assets,
warehouses, the inventory itself, raw materials, work in process,
working capital, investment assets, prepaid expenses and stock of a
subsidiary.

If the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership which owns production
assets, a pro rata portion of those assets will be attributed to the
taxpayer from the partnership. If the taxpayer is a member of an
affiliated group within the meaning of Code S1504(a), the production
activity of the members of its group must be taken into account.

Tangible production assets are located where they are found and
intangible production assets are located where the associated tangible
assets are found.

As under the current regulations, an independent factory price may be
used to determine the source of income. It may only be elected if the
taxpayer regularly sells part of its output to wholly independent
distributors or other selling concerns in such a way as to reasonably
reflect the income earned from production activity.

Also, a taxpayer may request advance permission to base its allocation
on its books and records. As part of its submission, the taxpayer must
show that the books and records are not affected by tax considerations.

Rules are also provided in the proposed regulations for transportation
income and for mineral extraction activities.

UNITED STATES: FINAL REGULATIONS FOR R & D EXPENSES

The IRS issued final regulations regarding the allocation and
apportionment of research & development ("R&D") expenses to various
classes of income. For US based taxpayers, the regulations will have
primary impact on the computation of the foreign tax credit limitation
and possibly the computation of combined taxable income for taxpayers
who export through foreign sales corporations or domestic international
sales corporations in order to obtain certain tax benefits.

The regulations finalise a proposal that was circulated for comment in
May 1995. The proposal provided relief to taxpayers in three broad
ways. It allowed taxpayers to allocate R&D expenses on the basis of a
three digit SIC code, rather than on the broader two digit code as
provided in existing law. The percentage of R&D expenses that may be
apportioned exclusively to US sources is 50 per cent if the sales
method of allocation is used.

This is an increase from 30 per cent under existing regulations. An
elective apportionment based on gross income is permitted, but once
elected may not be changed without the permission of the LRS.

The final regulations modify the proposed regulations in two broad
ways. First, taxpayers that elect the gross income method of
apportionment may make an exclusive apportionment of 25 per cent of the
R&D to the US. Under the proposed regulations, an exclusive
apportionment was allowed only if taxpayers elected the sales method of
apportionment. The IRS believes that this is an equivalent benefit to
the exclusive apportionment of 50 per cent under the sales method.

Second, the prior written consent of the IRS to change from the gross
income method to another method is no longer required once the taxpayer
has used the gross income method for 5 years.

The IRS and Treasury have advised tax practitioners that publication
date for the "check the box" regulatory proposal for classifying
entities will be delayed into 1996. A simplified system of classifying
international entities is apparently controversial within the IRS and
is holding up the project.

Regulation writers apparently view the proposal as unduly taxpayer
favourable and are opposed to granting taxpayers any leeway in
classifying foreign entities. The overall project may be severed into
domestic and international projects to break the log jam. It is also
reported that the status of one person entitles will not be addressed
in the regulatory proposal.

In an attempt to raise tax revenue from persons other than local
voters, states have been attempting to collect income tax on pensions
payments and deferred compensation paid to persons who worked in the
state but who are no longer resident at the time of receipt.

Legislative language has been approved for a Federal bill that would
protect employees from tax in this situation. It is reported that the
proposal will cover non-qualified deferred compensation plans only when
the plan has a minimum 10 year payout or when the benefits are tied to
a qualified plan.

foreign currency, no discharge exists.

Congress approved a bill effective from January 1, 1996, reducing
corporate income tax from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. The additional
tax on profits over R$ 240,000,000 is reduced from 18 per cent to 10

profit is introduced.

The distribution of profits or dividends based on profits determined
after January 1, 1996, will not be subject to income tax for taxpayers

HONG KONG: EXPENDITURE ON PRIVATE CARS

A Bill has been published to disallow deductions for all forms of
expenditure on private cars.

All outgoings and expenditure incurred in connection with the
acquisition, financing, leasing, maintenance, operation or use of a
private car (other than that incurred in respect of trading stock) is
to be disallowed as a deduction in the computation of assessable
profits for business profits tax.

All outgoings and expenditure incurred by employees on the acquisition,
financing, leasing, maintenance, operation or use of a private car is
to be disallowed as a deduction in the computation of assessable income
for salaries tax.

Private cars are to be specifically excluded from the definition of
machinery or plant for the purposes of initial and annual depreciation
allowances on capital expenditure.

The purpose of the proposed legislation is to discourage the use of
private cars which are causing serious traffic congestion and
pollution.

INDONESIA: TAX INCENTIVES PARTIALLY RESTORED

Following major amendments to Indonesia's principal tax laws in 1995
(see FTWTR February 1995 page 34 and March page 56) there have been
attempts to further restrict the already limited tax incentives
available in Indonesia. The official view is that the basic framework
of Indonesian tax law is structured to be internationally competitive
and thereby tax inducements should not be necessary to stimulate
particular sectors of the economy.

The top marginal rate of corporate and personal income tax had been
reduced from 35 per cent to 30 per cent. The Minister of Finance has
been granted authority to reduce the top rate to 25 per cent.

Remaining incentives included deferral of value added tax for approved
investment companies including foreign investment companies. Also the
corporate income tax and value added tax arising from contracts
financed by foreign grant or loan aid were borne by the government of
Indonesia under previous regulations. The Directorate General of Taxes
sought to discontinue deferral of value added tax under the provisions
of the amended Value Added Tax law. A Presidential Decree was published
in April whereby foreign aid financed contracts signed on or after
April 1, 1995 would be subject to tax.

Both changes were controversial and generated considerable discussion
and lobbying. Further changes have recently been announced which
partially reinstate the facilities. Deferral of value added tax has
been restored in respect of all investments which have been approved by
the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) but not later than March 31,
1996.

The related investments must be realised by December 31, 1999. This is
only a partial restoration of facilities for deferral of value added
tax but may enable those potential investors, which had made plans
assuming deferral of value added tax, to go ahead. The period of
realisation may, however, not be extended sufficiently for large
projects where delays are not uncommon. The imposition of VAT on new
investments of plant and equipment results in additional cash outflows
of 10 per cent during the investment period of a project. Although such
value added tax may be recovered, extended delays in refunds are not
uncommon.

Tax facilities for foreign aid contractors have been restored following
the publishing of Presidential Decree No 42/1995 dated November 30,
1995. The implementation is back dated to April 1, 1995 and thus
cancels Presidential Decree No 13/1995 which had withdrawn facilities.
The government of Indonesia will thus continue to bear the corporate
income tax and branch profits tax applicable to such contracts.
Facilities also extend to import duties, value added tax and sales tax
on luxury goods. Facilities only extend to the main contractor and not
its employees or subcontractors.

SOUTH KOREA: 1996 AMENDMENTS

Significant tax reforms have come into effect at the beginning of
January 1996.

Corporate Tax Rates
Taxable Income             1995     1996
up to W100 million         18%      16%
over W100 million          30%      28%

Inhabitant tax of 10 per cent (7.5 per cent in 1995) of corporate tax
should be also included. Agricultural and Fishery communities Special
Tax of 2 per cent on taxable income exceeding W500 million is no longer
applicable in 1996.

Tax Credits

Affiliated companies are those with equity ownership of 20 per cent or
more. The underlying tax on dividends from affiliated companies is
credited from fiscal year beginning January 1, 1996 as follows:

Tax                   Dividend amount
amount of       X     ------------------
affiliated            After tax earnings
company               of affiliated
                      company

Entertainment Expenses Limit

The limit has been changed to the total of W24,000,000 plus 1 per cent
of net worth up to W5 million plus a percentage of revenue on a sliding
scale as follows:

Sales                         %
below W10 billion           0.3
over W10 billion            0.2
over W100 billion           0.1

Accumulated Earnings Tax

Retained earnings appropriated as the reserve for development is
excluded from the tax base for accumulated earnings tax. The reserve
for development may be used to reduce deficits or transferred to
capital only.

Taxation on Capital Transactions

Stock dividends received as a result of the transfer of the capital
surplus including asset revaluation surplus to the capital were
previously taxed as deemed dividends.

After the tax revision, the dividends obtained through such transaction
are exempt from income taxes.

Transfer Pricing

As the tax disputes between nations are increasing, and to be in line
with the world trend, and to provide a legal basis for assessing taxes
on the international transactions between related parties, the Ministry
of Finance and Economy legislated the tax regulations on international
transfer pricing effective from January 1, 1996.

Arm's length price and methods to determine arm's length price such as
comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost plus
method, are described in detail.

Foreign corporations or non residents who have voting rights of 50 per
cent or more, directly or indirectly, and have the authority to make
decisions on the management of one company are classified as overseas
related parties. If the trades with such related parties are not
conducted at arm's length price, the transfer price can be adjusted.

The National Tax Administration can request information on
international transactions, such as basis of calculating transfer
price. Decree article 4.2 required disclosure of method and basis in
the final tax return starting the tax return for 1996. Taxpayers may be
penalised for failure to provide information in the amount of W30
million or less.

Thin Capitalisation

Interest paid on loans from a parent company or guaranteed by a parent
company in excess of 3 times the capital amount is deemed as dividend.
The ratio is 6:1 for financial institutions.

Controlled Foreign Corporations

Distributable earnings of affiliates located in tax havens are deemed
to be distributed to Korean corporate shareholders. An affiliate is one
where the shareholder has 20 per cent or more of the equity. A tax
haven is a jurisdiction with a corporate tax rate below 15 per cent.

A resident who gifts assets located abroad to a non resident is
required to pay gift tax thereon in Korea.

The procedures for mutual agreement to settle tax disputes between tax
authorities have been clearly defined.

AUSTRALIA: INTEREST WITHHOLDING TAX EXEMPTION

The Government has announced that a number of significant changes will
be made to the exemption from withholding tax applicable to some types
of interest paid to foreign lenders. The changes are designed to
enhance Australian borrowers' access to overseas capital markets.
Interest paid to foreign lenders that does not qualify for the
exemption is subject to a 10 per cent interest withholding tax.

The current interest withholding tax exemption has four features:

- interest must be paid by an Australian corporation to foreign
lenders,

- borrowings must be by way of widely held debentures issued by an
Australian borrower,

- the borrowed funds must be used for business purposes, and

- the borrower must obtain an exemption certificate from the
Commissioner of Taxation prior to the payment of interest.

Changes to the exemption will eliminate the need for taxpayers to
obtain an exemption certificate and will modify other requirements of
the present law. Thus, in line with Australia's new self-assessment
system, it will be the responsibility of Australian borrowers to
ascertain whether the interest qualifies for an exemption from the
interest withholding tax.

Importantly, the requirement that borrowed funds must be used in an
Australian business will be removed, so the withholding tax exemption
will be available where borrowed funds are used to finance housing and
consumer loans.

The wide distribution of debentures requirement will be replaced by a
"public offer" test. To satisfy the public offer test, funds must be
raised by the issue of securities to unrelated foreign lenders by a
company resident in Australia. It will no longer be necessary to meet
the stricter "widely-held" test formerly used.

To protect the integrity of the interest withholding tax where no
exemption applies, borrowers who fail to deduct interest withholding
tax from non-exempt interest payments will be denied a deduction for
the interest payments.

The new interest withholding tax exemption rules apply from January 1,
1996.

AUSTRALIA: OFFSHORE BANKING UNITS

The Government is modifying the Offshore Banking Units regime to
provide Australian-based offshore banking units with greater
flexibility. An offshore banking unit is a banking entity located in
Australia that borrows and re-lends funds offshore. Interest payments
by offshore banking units are exempt from interest withholding tax.

To ensure the operations of offshore banking units were completely
insulated from Australian banking businesses, the original offshore
banking units exemption imposed strict quarantine rules on the units,
including prohibitions on Australian investments.

Offshore banking units that undertake fund management activities have
argued that the prohibition prevents them from offering clients
balanced global portfolios, which normally would contain some
Australian assets. The government has responded to the criticism by
announcing that offshore banking units that undertake fund management
activities will be able to invest up to 10 per cent of the value of
total funds under management in Australian assets.

AUSTRALIA: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONCESSION

The government has announced changes to the research and development
(R&D) tax concession, which provides a 150 per cent deduction for
eligible R&D expenditures, to combat 'gravedigging' practices designed
to exploit the concession.

The 'gravedigging' practice involves consultants examining company
records for previous years' expenditures that might qualify for the
special deduction and applying long after the fact for recognition of
expenses as R&D outlays.

Under the new rules, registration for the concession must take place
within six months of the end of the year in which the expenses were
incurred. Transitional arrangements will allow registration of expenses
incurred in the 1993-94 tax year and the 1994-95 tax year (ending 30
June 1995) until 30 June 1996. Expenses incurred prior to 1 July 1993
will no longer be eligible for the concession.

AUSTRALIA: ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISION RESTRICTED

The apparent scope of Australia's general anti-avoidance provision has
been substantially narrowed following the decision of the Full Federal
Court in Spotless Services Limited & Anor 95 ATC 4775.

The taxpayer in the Spotless case had $40 million dollars invested on
the overnight money market and was seeking alternative longer-term, tax
effective investments. After discussions with various merchant banks it
settled on a scheme that involved the transfer of funds through a
series of bank transfers from Melbourne to the Cook Islands, where the
funds were eventually deposited.

Interest paid on the deposit was subject to Cook Islands withholding
tax of 5 per cent. The taxpayer then claimed the interest was exempt
from Australian tax pursuant to a provision that formerly exempted from
Australian tax income subject to foreign tax in its country of source.

The Commissioner attacked the arrangement, arguing the true source of
the income was Australia, where the scheme was devised and the money
originally deposited, not the Cook Islands, where it was finally
deposited. The Commissioner argued in the alternative that the
arrangements should be struck down on the basis of the general anti-
avoidance provision in the income tax legislation.

The Federal Court rejected the first argument, finding that the source
of the interest income was the Cook Islands because the taxpayer
completed the deposit contract in the Cook Islands, and ignoring the
earlier steps in the scheme.

The Court agreed that several of the elements required for the
operation of the general anti-avoidance provision were satisfied, but
concluded that the principal element required by the provision, that
the scheme be one of the dominant purpose of which was to obtain a tax
benefit, had not been satisfied. The dominant purpose of the scheme,
the Court said, was a commercial one, to obtain the maximum return on
the money investment after the payment of all applicable costs,
including tax.

The effect of the decision is to revive the "choice" doctrine used by
courts to decimate a predecessor general anti-avoidance provision.
Under the choice doctrine, the general anti-avoidance provision had no
application if the taxpayer were faced with two commercial choices and
chose the option that attracted the lower tax liability.

If the decision is not reversed by the High Court, legislative
amendment of the anti-avoidance provision is likely. In the meantime,
the scope of the anti-avoidance measure is severely constrained.

AUSTRALIA: GOODWILL

The Australian Taxation Office has recently lost two important cases on
the meaning of goodwill for tax purposes. The decisions open the door
to considerable tax benefits for many owners of small businesses.

The meaning of goodwill is relevant to a capital gains tax concession
that exempts from taxation 50 per cent of the gain realised on the sale
of a small business (with a net value of less than $2 million) that is
attributable to the sale of goodwill associated with the business.

In the first case, Case 59/95, the taxpayer sold a taxi business,
including the car, equipment, shares in a cab co-operative, and taxi
licence and attributed the amount of consideration received in respect
of the taxi licence (calculated as the excess of consideration received
over the market value of the car, equipment, and shares) as payment for
"goodwill" and thus eligible for the 50 per cent exemption.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal agreed with the taxpayer's
characterisation, concluding that the value of the licence was in its
power to confer monopoly privileges to the holder and in the context of
a taxi business, these privileges amounted to the goodwill of the
business.

In the second case, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Krakos
Investments (not yet reported), the taxpayer sold a hotel and pub
business and leased the business premises to the new owners. The
Commissioner of Taxation characterised the significant payment received
by the vendor as a lease premium, reflecting the location value to the
business, while the taxpayer claimed the payment was consideration for
the sale of business goodwill.

The full Federal Court agreed with the taxpayer's characterisation. The
decision is likely to have a major impact on the tax consequences of
sales of small businesses, as it makes it very difficult for the
Commissioner to carve out part of the sale price and attribute it to
factors apart from general goodwill.

NEW ZEALAND: DEDUCTIONS FOR WARRANTY CLAIMS

In CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has allowed a deduction for
expected warranty claims. Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited
("Mitsubishi") sold vehicles to dealers for on-sale and indemnified
those dealers for a warranty provided on sale against defects in
material or workmanship appearing within one year or 20,000 kilometres,
whichever occurred earlier. Evidence was given in the High Court that
in 1988 63 per cent of vehicles sold gave rise to a subsequent warranty
claim for which Mitsubishi indemnified the relevant dealers.

Mitsubishi deducted the estimated warranty costs for tax purposes in
the year in which the vehicles were sold. The Commissioner subsequently
disallowed the deduction. The case was argued on different bases:

- Whether the estimated warranty expense was properly deductible as
being "incurred" under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976 ("Act")
in the year of sale of the vehicle;

- Whether, if no deduction was available under section 104, the
estimated warranty costs nevertheless reduced the assessable income
properly derived in the year of sale, ie the purchase price was not
fully earned until the warranty period expired (at the latest, one year
later); or,

Whether the warranty income should be spread under the accruals rules
contained in sections 64B to 64M of the Act.

The High Court held that a deduction was properly allowable under
section 104. The Court of Appeal held that a deduction was not
allowable under section 104 because the estimated warranty expense was
not incurred. However, the Court held that to the extent that the price
for the vehicle included an amount for the warranty, that amount was
not derived in the year of sale but should be spread over the period of
the warranty under ordinary principles. The Court of Appeal also held
that the accrual rules did not apply to the particular contact. The
Privy Council disagreed with the Court of Appeal and held that a
deduction was properly allowable under section 104.

Their Lordships considered the terms of the warranty to determine
whether Mitsubishi became "definitely committed" to the estimated
expenditure in the year of sale of each vehicle. They agreed with the
Court of Appeal that the effect of the warranty was not a promise that
the vehicle was free from defects on sale. They held that any liability
was contingent on a defect appearing and notification being made within
the warranty period and until that occurred, no liability was incurred.

Nevertheless, although that conclusion on the scope of the warranty
resulted in the Court of Appeal finding that the ability to deduct was
deferred to a later income year, that was not the end of the matter for
their Lordships.

They were not prepared to determine deductibility by rather arcane
legal distinctions between contingency and defeasibility as had been
done in earlier cases and by the Court of Appeal. The question was
whether with all the surrounding circumstances a legal obligation in
the future can be said to have accrued. In making that determination
theoretical contingencies were disregarded. Given the data available,
their Lordships held that the defects were a matter of existing fact,
not future contingency, as 63 per cent of the vehicles sold were found
to display defects within the warranty period. Those defects must have
existed at the time of sale.

The contingency that owners might choose not to seek repairs was likely
to be quite small and would not make a material difference to the
accuracy of the estimated expenditure. Accordingly, their Lordships
held that the warranty costs were deductible in the year of sale under
section 104 of the Act.

The finding on deductibility made it unnecessary for their Lordships to
reach a view on either of the other issues. However, they did comment
in relation to the second issue that, because Mitsubishi had not made a
separate charge for the warranty, in their view there was no
justification for treating part of the price of the vehicle as if it
were a separate charge for the warranty. They indicated that in their
opinion the full price should have been recognised as income and there
could be no deferral of income for the warranty costs.

They would not have been prepared, if a deduction was not allowable, to
"manipulate" the ordinary rules for the recognition of income to give
such a deferral.

The decision of the Privy Council does seem to have changed the test
for determining when expenditure is incurred for the purpose of being
deductible under the Act. For the reasons set out below, however, this
change may not have much practical significance.

SPAIN/PORTUGAL TAX TREATY

The ratification of the Spain/Portugal income tax treaty signed in
Madrid on October 26, 1993, was published in the Spanish Official State
Bulletin on November 7, 1995. It replaces one since 1968 and addresses
the problems arising from the new financial relationship between the
two countries.

Section 10 of the new treaty retains the right to tax dividends in the
payers's country. The rate of tax may not exceed 10 per cent if the
recipient holds 25 per cent of the authorised share capital of the
paying company directly.

Income from Government Stock may be taxed in both states.

Interest may be taxed in the contracting state of origin at a rate not
exceeding 15 per cent.

Capital Gains

While the 1968 agreement permitted the country of residence only to tax
capital gains, the new agreement provides that gains may be subject to
tax in the state where the company, whose shares have been sold, is
resident if the vendor has, either directly or indirectly, held at
least 25 per cent of the authorised share capital of the said company
for the previous twelve months.

Companies, whose assets consist of land and buildings, may be liable
for tax in the country in which the lands and buildings are located.

Limitation of Benefits

No reductions in or exemptions from the taxation of dividends, capital
gains, royalties or interest shall apply in the case of companies
engaged in the management of securities or other assets if more than 50
per cent of the authorised capital is held by shareholders who are not
resident in the state where the company in question is domiciled. This
is to prevent the carrying out of circular investment operations.

INDIA/MALTA TAX TREATY

India notified an income tax treaty with Malta, on November 23, 1995.
The treaty covers income tax and surcharge in India, and income tax in
Malta. However, the income tax on petroleum produced in Malta, is not
covered.

Business profits would be taxable in the source country, if the
enterprise carries on business through the permanent establishment
(PE), therein. However, profits, directly or indirectly attributable to
the PE, will only be taxable if the PE takes an active part in
negotiating, concluding or fulfilling contracts entered into by the
enterprise. Attribution will be to the extent of the contribution of
the PE in those transactions. The PE provision is not applicable to
insurance profits.

The term PE, among other fixed places of businesses, includes an
offshore drilling site. A building site or construction or assembly
project or connected supervisory activities is a PE, if it lasts for
more than 6 months. Certain activities are deemed a PE. Exploration of
the seabed, and its sub-soil or exploration of natural resources
situated there as well as activities, which are complimentary or
auxiliary to such activities. Also included is the use or installation
of substantial equipment or connected supervisory activities.

Dividends, interest, royalties and fees for services, and technical
service fees, are taxable in both the states. Tax in the source state,
may not exceed on dividends in India, 15 per cent, reduced to 10 per
cent, in the hands of a 25 per cent participating company. In Malta,
the tax may not exceed that chargeable on the profits out of which the
dividends are paid. On interest the maximum rate is 10 per cent.

Technical fees and royalties are taxable at 10 and 15 per cent
respectively. Total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or
supply of the specified property or right is also be covered by the
term 'royalties'.

Capital gains on the alienation of shares is generally taxable in the
state of residence of the alienator.

Double taxation is be avoided by the credit method. Tax sparing is
allowed for. Exempt income is taken into account for rate purposes.

US TREATY UPDATE

Kazakstan

Ratification of a negotiated income tax treaty with Kazakstan has been
delayed because of provisions in Kazak law permitting the use of
anonymous bank accounts and protecting investor secrecy. It has been
reported that a procedure will be adopted by the Kazak government that
will allow foreign governments to have access to anonymous accounts.

Netherlands Antilles

The protocol terminating the exemption for interest income that appears
in Article VIII, the sole remaining provision of the income tax treaty
between the US and the Netherlands Antilles, for most taxpayers was
submitted to the Senate for its approval. The protocol will allow
Article VIII to continue in existence for debt paid to finance
subsidiaries in connection with Eurobond offerings issued and
outstanding on or before October 15, 1984.

Switzerland

Negotiations regarding the open issues between the US and Swiss
governments are scheduled for early January. Not surprisingly, the
limitation on benefits provision which the US demands as part of its
treaty programme is a sticking point.

Ireland

Negotiations between delegations from the Republic of Ireland and the
US were held in December and apparently significant progress was made
regarding outstanding issues. As in the negotiations with Switzerland,
the limitation on benefits article is the principal sticking point.

France

Instruments of ratification of the new income tax treaty were exchanged
on December 30, 1995, causing the new treaty to be effective as of
January 1, 1996.

INTERNATIONAL TAX BOOKS

The Taxation of International Entertainers And Athletes

by Daniel Sandler.

The Chartered Institute of Taxation, Kluwer Law International;
Hardcover, 356 pages

Why are entertainers and athletes singled out for special tax
treatment? In his introduction the author notes that they are probably
the most mobile individuals in the business world. As they become more
well known income may be derived in many different countries and
residential ties to a particular country may lessen. Taxation of such
individuals in a source country may be problematic given the short stay
and the lack of any strong economic ties with that country.

The author also refers to concerns expressed in the 1987 OECD study on
taxation of the entertainment business that imply that entertainers
either evade tax or at best negligently prepare their returns.
Certainly he notes that perceived abuses by such individuals are better
reported than abuses by other taxpayers who do not enjoy celebrity
status.

The central focus of this book is a comparative analysis of the tax
treatment of non-resident entertainers and athletes in seven countries
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the
United States. The key themes are firstly the question of allocation of
income and secondly enforcement. Most countries adopt withholding
mechanisms. Given the complexity of the entertainment industry a number
of issues are involved depending on the nature of the source of income.
The clash between personal service income and a royalty income is
particularly difficult.

The analysis of each country proceeds through an examination of the
taxation of non-residence generally and the treatment of non-residents
employed or carrying on business in the particular country. It also
considers the treatment of royalties and the general withholding
arrangements, as well as those specifically applicable to entertainers
and athletes. In each case, the effect of tax treaties on domestic law
is considered, as well as the application of VAT.

The OECD study on the taxation of entertainers and athletes refers to
sophisticated tax avoidance and an industry increasingly categorised by
loosely connected chains of companies, partnerships and joint ventures.
However, the principal focus of planning and indeed, anti-avoidance
rules apart from withholding, analysed in the book revolves around the
use of loan-out and slave companies. In each jurisdiction, the
treatment of such entities is considered in detail.

A chapter is devoted to a detailed analysis of article 17 of the OECD
model convention. He covers the history and interpretation of the
article in great detail. It illustrates some of the anomalies in the
rule where although singers and actors are covered by the article their
entourage is not. Other closely related professions who are equally
mobile such as "super models" also appear to be excluded.

This is a thorough and detailed book. For example in considering
article 17 he analyses in some detail the concerns of each of the
countries considered in relation to their concerns on the application
of article 17 in the context of their domestic laws.

Many tax books today are padded out with appendices comprising
voluminous source material. This is certainly not the case here. The
tax treaties of all of the countries have been carefully researched and
the results are contained in tables identifying the date when the
treaty entered into force, articles analogous to article 17,
limitations on the application of the article within the treaty and
other relevant comments.

A further chapter is devoted to illustrating the rules by reference to
examples. They comprise a pop group on a world tour and a professional
athlete participating in a number of tournaments around the world.

This is not a book about tax planning. Indeed the concerns of the
author expressed in the conclusion are for effective and efficient
taxation of non-resident entertainers and athletes and the policy
issues relating to it. The bulk of the book covers income tax although
VAT is also considered.

It is a highly thoughtful, thoroughly researched and very readable
book. It is clearly a must read for anyone involved in this area. Its
only drawback is the absence of an index although the lengthy
bibliography is extremely useful.

DEAR SUBSCRIBER,

Don't be surprised if you walk into your phone closet and find it
empty. That big, bulky PBX may soon be replaced by a tiny PC
card.

A PC card now sold by NetPhone, Northboro, Mass., performs all
the standard functions of a PBX, including basic call switching,
executing hunt groups, call forwarding and conferencing, for
example.

The best thing about the NetPhone, however, is its price. The
card and its accompanying software only cost $4,295. That price
easily beats spending several hundred thousand dollars for a PBX,
says Dave Zweiban, telecom consultant at the International Group,
Los Angeles, Calif.

Here's how the NetPhone works: The Windows-based system operates
on a 486 PC that uses Novell Netware and acts as a server on a
LAN, says NetPhone spokesman Bob Fletcher. The card plugs into
the 16-bit ISA slot of the PC, and is connected to phone lines on
a punchdown block.

One card can only handle six trunks and 18 extensions, but six
cards can be installed on a single 486 PC, says Fletcher. Your
full capacity is 36 incoming trunks and 108 extensions -- enough
for a mid-sized site.

NetPhone also includes features that aren't standard on PBXs. A
voice mail system, an automatic attendant and a CTI program that
links Caller ID numbers to customer records are included in
NetPhone's software. And each PC on your LAN is loaded with
software that receives Caller ID from the PBX server and links it
to files, Fletcher says.

But is the PC card too good to be true? Many of the long-standing
PBX manufacturers think so. The majority of PC-card PBXs can't
handle digital lines, T1s or ISDN yet, says Tony Tissot, a
director of marketing at Rolm, San Jose, Calif. And, there is
little redundancy built into the cards, adds Tissot. In most
stand-alone PBXs, you can order back-up circuits for
mission-critical applications, he says.

Tissot is right on many counts. The NetPhone system, for example,
can only handle analog trunks and phones for now, and doesn't
support T1s, ISDN or frame relay. Plus, NetPhone doesn't have a
UPS (uninterruptable power supply) built into it. But, the
company does suggest putting at least a 30-minute UPS on your
server.

When power goes out completely, each card has an automatic "ring
down" feature, says Fletcher. That means each card has one
extension that works off the phone company's power, so you can
dial out, he adds. And, if your server gets locked up or fails,
but its power is still on, the PBX will function normally,
although voice mail and CTI will not run.

NetPhone is now working on T1 and ISDN capabilities for its
cards, and plans to have them ready by the end of '96, says
Fletcher. The company is also developing programming that will
let companies link PBX servers together and control them from a
central PC. That would eliminate one of the other current
advantages of PBXs, says Fletcher.

Ironically, Mitel doesn't think card-based PBXs are a bad idea.
The company is developing a PBX for release in 1996 that combines
PC cards and a LAN server, says Mitel marketing manager Rob
Clark. The cards plug into the back of a PC and will connect to
both digital lines and T1s, he adds. Up to 200 extensions can be
serviced by the PBX.

Manufacturing PC cards that switch calls isn't a big gamble,
Clark explains. "Companies will be pushed into using CTI as it
becomes more and more common in business, and customers will even
start requesting it," he says. "And CTI is very easily integrated
with LANs -- in some cases more so than with PBXs," Clark adds.

Note: if you buy an initial NetPhone card, the card's price is
reduced to $3,295 for additional cards. NetPhone's number is
(508) 393-7979.

MOTOROLA BEATS CELLULAR "PHREAKS"

Worried that hackers may run up big bucks on your company's
cellular phones? Motorola is taking a step that should prevent
hackers from using devices to intercept your phones' electronic
serial numbers and phone numbers.

The company is launching a new line of phones with a microchip
that encrypts each subscriber's phone number and serial number.
Encryption encodes the numbers with algorithms that can only be
decoded by a decryption key at cellular base stations.

Phreaks will still be able to intercept signals, but shouldn't be
able to crack encrypted codes without a decryption key.

USE YOUR ROOFTOP TO MAKE BIG BUCKS

Look up at the stars. Do you see dollar signs in the heavens? You
could if you look a little lower and rent out your rooftop for
wireless antennas.

Rooftop management companies desperately want rooftop space to
meet a rising demand for antenna locations from wireless
carriers. The telecom bill and the '96 auction of PCS licenses
will create an explosion in the number of rooftops needed for
cellular, microwave, PCS and paging antennas over the next three
years, says John Cipollone, vice president of Tower Economics
Company Inc., Bala Cynwyd, Pa. Tower Economics, a rooftop
management company, is now signing deals for rooftop space that
pay owners between $300 and $1,300 per month, adds Cipollone.

The best part of generating revenue with rooftop leases is that
registering with the management companies is free, says Jim
Innes, director of telecom leasing at Apex, Philadelphia, Pa. The
companies put your buildings on their list of eligible sites and
do all of the marketing to wireless carriers, adds Innes. And the
rooftop companies get paid by earning a commission on the monthly
payments a carrier gives you, but only after a deal is signed,
explains Innes. You don't have to do any of the dirty work, like
conducting tests for interference or writing up contracts.

The Teachers College at Columbia University, New York City,
recently got a surprise when it was offered a deal for rooftop
space. The college was considering going with Local Area
Telecommunications (Locate), New York City, for local service
when Locate's technicians noticed one of the college's buildings
was ideal for a microwave antenna, says Tom Fiorella, a business
services analyst at the college.

Locate had rooftop management company AAT Communications Corp.,
Edison, N.J., contact the university and make an offer for space
on the 15-story building, says Fiorella. The offer was $4,800 per
year for 10 square feet of rooftop, he adds.

What type of buildings are needed? Virtually any height is used
by carriers, says Arne Jerfsten, manager of technical support at
Locate. Many small buildings are positioned on hills that provide
good locations for antennas, he adds. Plus, PCS antennas don't
have to be located high above the ground, says Cipollone.

Even if your company is located in a rural area, you should
register with a rooftop management company, says Jim Innes,
director of telecom leasing at Apex, Philadelphia, Pa. Carriers
must reach rural areas if they want to stay competitive, Innes
explains. You can register with multiple management companies,
such as AAT at (908) 417-3993, Tower Economics at (610) 667-0351
and Apex at (215) 875-0791.

5 TIPS FOR GENERATING ROOFTOP DOLLARS

Here are five tips from rooftop management professionals on how
to take advantage of the upcoming need for space:

1. Make sure the carrier that wants to use your rooftop does an
interference study before its equipment is installed. Carriers
are required to do so by FCC rules that say the integrity of the
surrounding area and its telecom equipment must be preserved,
says Jerfsten.

2. Get a copy of the local zoning laws by contacting the city or
county your building is located in. Some areas prohibit buildings
from reaching certain heights.

3. Make sure the rooftop company considers your building's
structure, says Innes. When dishes grow larger than two feet
across, some walls have to be reinforced. Structural alterations
usually bring an increase in the monthly revenue you can make,
however.

4. If you want negotiations with a carrier to be as little of a
burden as possible for your company, have a rooftop management
company handle them, says Columbia University's Fiorella. But,
you may be able to get more money if you handle the deal
yourself, he adds.

5. Don't hold out on a deal for long periods of time for extra
money. Carriers need space so quickly that they will make an
offer to another company while you are waiting, says Cipollone.

A LOCAL SERVICE REFUND FROM THE BELLS?

MCI has petitioned the FCC to require the Baby Bells to return
millions of dollars in lobbying expenses that were unlawfully
billed to customers. So, you may soon get a boost for your
budget.

The FCC found the Bells improperly charged ratepayers $116.5
million from 1988-1991 for lobbying in a recent audit. But,
instead of requiring the RBOCs to give back the money to
customers, the FCC only slashed the price cap on future Bell
access charges by $5 million, MCI claims.

The FCC found BellSouth passed on $27 million in expenses, Bell
Atlantic $21.5 million, Ameritech $18 million, Southwestern Bell
and Nynex $14 million each, PacTel $12 million and U S West $10
million.

NEW FAX SERVICES MAKE YOU AN OFFICE HERO

Read this and your staff may erect a statue of you. That's
because you can save them loads of word processing by converting
faxes into files that can be read by WordPerfect, Microsoft Word
and Excel before they reach the office.

Educational Testing Services (ETS) in Princeton, N.J., has saved
money on data processing by using a fax-conversion service from
Global Fax, Warren, Mich. Incoming faxes are changed into a
language compatible with ETS's IBM mainframes, says Frank
McKeown, principle systems engineer at ETS.

Global Fax is processing the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)
registration form for ETS, says McKeown. The forms are
standardized and have fill-in circles and blanks for hand-written
answers, he adds.

And when they are faxed to ETS's 800 number, they are routed to
Global Fax by AT&T, says Paul Kennedy, vice president at Global
Fax. Our company then changes the faxes into two seperate file
formats for the educational testing company, he adds.

Besides the mainframe files, ETS is having Global Fax make TIFF
(Tagged Image File Format) files from the original faxes so ETS
can load them into Hijack fax software for viewing, adds McKeown.
ETS has always had a company policy of keeping original copies of
registration forms in case questions from students arise later,
says McKeown.

Global Fax emphasizes that faxes can be converted into almost any
language, including ASCII and DOS Text. Companies use the service
to drop faxed product orders and invoices straight into
accounting software, for example, says Kennedy.

ETS can't pinpoint exactly how much money it has saved, but under
its pilot program, it has received 2,000 two-page faxes in the
past two months. Paying employees to enter the data from the
forms into ETS's computer system would have been much more than
it cost for Global Fax to convert them in a few hours, says
McKeown.

Global Fax says that in general, fax-to-data conversion costs
between $1.00 and $3.00 per fax. The price depends on the length
of the fax, the number of data fields involved, how much
conversion from hand-written copy is needed and the amount of
accuracy desired. Global Fax offers from 95% to 99.9% accuracy.

But McKeown says to shop around. He went with Global Fax because
the company gave him the best offer out of three companies he
requested proposals from. You can get a list of fax-to-data
companies by calling your 800 carrier. Global Fax's number is
(800) 887-4329.

5 TIPS ON STARTING A FAX-TO-DATA PROGRAM

Here are five more tips from McKeown on how to begin a
fax-to-data program that will save you bucks:

1. Prevent customers from sending extra faxes on your 800 lines
by having them include their credit card numbers on faxes. Give
customers a warning that if more than one fax is sent with their
credit card number, they will be charged for the extra faxes.

2. Make sure your fax-to-data service provider notifies you of
the number of faxes that come out garbled. If the number gets too
high, you should discontinue the service.

3. Market the fax service as a convenient tool for customers.
After all, they don't have to pay for postage or a phone call to
make orders.

4. Use caution because some fax-to-data companies have you dial
into one of their databases to retrieve faxes. If that's the
case, make sure you have a service with enough bandwidth that
downloading image files doesn't tie up your lines for hours.

5. Find out if the fax-to-data company you are considering has an
archiving service. Global Fax will back up faxes at its
facilities for a period from days to weeks after they are
received for a reasonable fee, says McKeown.

PC CARD LIFTS YOU TO FRAME RELAY CLOUDS FOR LESS

You could lay $2,000 on the table to buy a frame relay router
that will link your LAN to a carrier's frame relay cloud.

But, you'd be paying too much. You can purchase a new PC card
from Motorola that makes the connection for only $999.

The card is called the Vanguard 100 PC. And, it lets you plug a
non-frame relay LAN router into it to send your LAN's traffic
onto a frame relay network. You don't have to pay for an
expensive upgrade of a current router or buy a new one to link to
frame relay, says Rod Wilson, a marketing director at Motorola,
Mansfield, Mass.

Another good use for the Vanguard 100: At remote sites where you
don't need more than one connection to your company's frame relay
network. When the card is plugged into the back of a PC, its
digital service unit can have a phone line configured for frame
relay plugged into it.

And there is a bonus with the Vanguard 100. If you can only get
ISDN at a site, the card can be ordered with an ISDN network
termination device on it. But watch out! It only handles one B
and one D channel because it was designed primarily for frame
relay, says Wilson.

Motorola says it doesn't have any users of the card yet because
it's so new. It, in fact, is the first FRAD (frame relay access
device) on a PC card on the market.

But the Vanguard 100 should find users quickly because it is an
easy way for companies to link to frame relay networks, says Tim
Burke, independent telecom analyst at the Yankee Group, Boston,
Mass. At this point the technical know-how isn't always there at
telcos when it comes to helping companies link to frame relay, he
explains. But the Vanguard 100 makes the connection a simple
plug-and-play operation, adds Burke.

There is a disadvantage. The Vanguard 100 will only give you a
connection speed of 56 Kbps, says Wilson. This limits the card to
use primarily at sites that don't have long, constant hours of
frame relay usage, adds Burke. Motorola's number is (508)
261-1058.

NEW CTI SYSTEM SAVES $500,000 AT OCTEL

Does CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) work budget miracles?
Linking phones and computers saved Octel Network Services,
Carrollton, Tex., $500,000 in 1995.

Using a CTI system from Fort Worth-based Teknekron Infoswitch cut
the average time that agents spend on calls from 180 seconds to
150 seconds. The number of calls taken by reps per hour also
increased from 7.5 to 12, and the average wrap-up time for
finalizing post-call records decreased from 120 seconds to 45
seconds. And, since Octel's agents take calls on 800 numbers that
the company pays for, the savings added up, says Kevin McKinnon,
director of customer service at Octel.

Another bonus: Although Octel's incoming calls doubled in 1995,
the company only had to hire 50% more staff. In past years, Octel
doubled its staff when calls doubled, says McKinnon.

The Teknekron CTI system that Octel installed is called
Orchestra!, and it sits on a central server and individual
workstations like most CTI programs. But Octel posed a special
problem because its workstations don't have hard drives, so the
CTI program couldn't be loaded on them.

Teknekron had to load both parts of Orchestra! onto the LAN
server and have screen-pops delivered to workstations using their
addresses, says McKinnon. At first, packets were not exchanged
correctly and the timing of the screen-pops was off, he adds. But
Teknekron fixed the problem within a few days and the CTI program
has worked fine ever since, McKinnon says.

A program called Rendezvous! makes the connection between a
Teknekron Series III ACD on Octel's SRX PBX and Orchestra! on the
LAN server. Rendezvous! is loaded onto a Sun SPARCstation
minicomputer (the two are sold together) and collects call data
from a management port on the ACD. Calls are then routed based on
the number that the customer has dialed or the customer's Caller
ID, among many options.

You can also list the skills of each of your representatives on
Rendezvous!, and then rank your agents' abilities on each skill.
Calls can be routed to the best available agent based on their
ratings.

McKinnon says that the cost of the Teknekron CTI system is
reasonable, especially considering the savings it has already
generated for Octel. Installing the Series III ACD, Orchestra!,
Rendezvous!, a Sun SPARCstation and AutoQuality! (which records
calls so you can monitor agents) runs $2,500 to $5,000 per
workstation, says John Kaiser, managing director at Teknekron.
The system usually pays for itself within a year or two, he adds.

One problem: Orchestra! only works with AT&T, Nortel and
Teknekron PBXs. Teknekron Infoswitch's number is (817) 267-3025.

IN BRIEF . . .

-- AT&T has announced plans to cut 40,000 jobs over the next
three years as part of its restructuring effort. Roughly 70% of
those positions will be slashed by the end of 1996, and most cuts
will occur in the U.S. The company also will take a $4 billion
charge against its fourth-quarter earnings to cover expenses
associated with its three-way split.

-- The FCC has shut down again except for essential personnel.
But, this time "essential personnel" includes employees who are
collecting bids for the C block PCS license auctions scheduled to
be finished in '96. So far, the first round of bids has brought
offers of over $437 million.

-- American Mobile Satellite Corp. (AMSC) and Mitsubishi
Electronics America introduced the first transportable satellite
phone available for use in North America. The phone operates
anywhere in the world that AMSC's satellites cover, and retails
for just under $3,000. Usage charges run as low as $1.49/minute
for long distance.

THE WEEK'S BEST DEALS

1. AT&T is giving customers who order new CustomNet a one-time
interstate usage credit per main account. The credit equals the
usage charges of interstate calls billed during the first month
after enrollment. It won't be greater than $5,000, and will
appear on the second invoice. Eligible customers are: those who
switch lines from another IXC's switched access service; or
existing Commercial Long Distance, Small Business Option,
CustomNet, Pro WATS/Plan Q or Distributed Network customers who
order new CustomNet service.

2. Looking for good international long distance rates? Sprint is
offering new and existing Clarity Option A or B, or VPN Premiere
customers discounts on international use. Existing customers must
have less than three, six or nine months left on a one-, two-,
three-, four- or five-year term plan and sign a new contract of
equal or greater length. New customers are eligible on their
first term plan. A 10% discount will be applied to international
voice use from the U.S. to Belgium and South Africa, and 15% will
be knocked off calls to Canada, Columbia, Ecuador, Italy, India,
Peru, Russia, Spain and Venezuala. Customers get the price break
for 12 months or the entire length of the term plan, whichever is
longer.

Sincerely,

Reed Miller

AIN INDUSTRY ANTICIPATES GROWTH, OPEN SYSTEMS IN 1996

     If 1994 was a year of lab tests and technical development, and
1995 was the year AIN moved from the lab into field deployments, what
will we call 1996 a year from now?  According to many in the industry,
1996 is going to be the year AIN gets down to business.  Many carriers
now have enough services in the market to begin leveraging them and
benefitting from combined service offerings.  AIN services are
proliferating and submerging into the network to the extent that they
don't generate quite as much amazement as they used to.  
     There continues to be tremendous momentum in the AIN hardware
market, but the wireless market is beginning to overshadow the Bell
operating companies (BOCs) as a source of business according to some
vendors, who see the BOCs as reaching a "hardware plateau."  Some
industry observers believe that the solution to this problem, and the
way to create continued growth in the AIN market, is to develop open
systems.  There are forces within the industry trying to achieve this,
and outside forces are converging on the market.  There are signs
that, one way or another, 1996 will be the year AIN interoperability
finally happens for real.

  ...Getting the Flywheel Up to Speed

     On the service side, synergistic effects are beginning to appear
for carriers who plunged into AIN early.  A prime example is
BellSouth, although the carrier's lead in service deployment may be
narrowing as other BOCs increased their activities and began to catch
up in 1995.
     BellSouth's Executive Director for AIN Scott Schaefer describes
the company's AIN division as an accelerating engine, with the carrier
gaining expertise, and customers beginning to drive the process to a
greater degree.  "Because we've gotten the proliferation of AIN that
we had in 1994 and 1995, we're starting to get a lot stronger feedback
loop from the marketplace," said Schaefer.  "They've got their hands
on this stuff.  They're using it, and they're coming up with new ideas
and extensions for services that we haven't thought of before."
     Expect the geographic scope of AIN services to expand in 1996 as
well, meeting the demands of customers who want services to work the
same way no matter where they are.  The bugs will eventually get
worked out of interstate caller ID, and the recent agreement between
Ameritech and U S West to share calling name databases is a sign of
things to come.

  ...More Hardware Players

     The growth of the AIN market and the increasing opportunities for
developers from the mainstream computing market will mean more new
hardware products and new industry participants in 1996.  
     "I think more people are going to be drawn into being technology
suppliers in the AIN arena," said Schaefer, "and not just at the
Service Control Point or Service Node levels, but maybe in niches like
voice recognition as a specialty that they would integrate with a
larger platform or some other specialty function.  There's room in
there for niche players to come in and integrate their specialty
within the broader AIN platform."
     The result of these new competitors will be continuing gains in
price/performance.  Hardware and software prices dropped significantly
in 1995, and this trend will continue in 1996.  
     Chris Ebling, marketing program manager at Tandem Computers Inc.
, agrees that Tandem's prices have come down since the beginning of
1995, as have those of its competitors.
     "It's a little bit more difficult to talk about the cost for
switch-based [intelligent networking]," said Ebling.  "That tends to
be hidden a little bit more in the overall bids the switch vendors put
out, but I suspect that has come down as well.  I've heard that the
pricing of IN loads on switches has come down significantly this year,
and that was one of the larger barriers for some of the smaller
independents to getting in."

  ...No Cottage Industry Yet

     The part of the original AIN promise that has so far been almost
completely overlooked is the appearance of third party software
developers.  Despite some interest from potential developers and some
efforts from carriers to accommodate them, the anticipated industry of
independent AIN service builders has simply not appeared.
     Ebling sees this as a serious problem for intelligent networking. 
"If we don't figure out a way to get third party application providers
involved in this market, then intelligent networking will remain just
an infrastructure product and it will never really realize its full
potential."
     According to Ebling, the only way to create this market is
through true interoperability, at a level that still does not exist in
the AIN market.     "There is no common application environment that
you can develop applications to," said Ebling.  "Tandem has its own. 
Yeah, we publish it.  Big deal.  HP has its environment.  IBM has its
environment with Bell Atlantic.  So people are creating proprietary
open systems if you will.  Sure they're open, but they're proprietary
in terms of the API so that people who are developing service logic
are doing that only for one vendor's system.  There's no portability
between the systems.  There's no incentive for someone to get involved
in that market because they'd be developing for one particular
platform and it's a very high investment to develop these kinds of
applications."
     Ebling argues that this will eventually become a crippling
limitation for AIN if it isn't overcome.  "Until we can figure out a
way to provide a common application environment, I believe that AIN
will never be much more than what it is today," said Ebling.  "It will
certainly never reach its full potential."
     One force attempting to overcome this problem is the Intelligent
Network Forum, which is accepting charter members until Jan 31.  Nine
companies have so far made financial commitments to the Forum.  (For
more information on the Forum, contact John C. Nowell at 312/507-
8882.) 

  ...Advanced Intelligent Internet?

     One standard which is beginning to show its face in the
intelligent networking field is TCP/IP.  The Internet protocol is
attracting large numbers of developers precisely because it has become
the de facto standard for large- scale data networks.  From the
Internet, TCP/IP is beginning to invade the corporate LAN market and
other fields as well, including intelligent networking.
     At least one company, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories
Inc., is working on a way use TCP/IP to integrate CPE-based
intelligence with the SS7-based intelligence of the signaling network. 
According to Vice President of Network Applications Richard Pickering,
TCP/IP is bringing about "a total change in the way intelligent
networks can be designed.  There is a sea change.  SS7 has had the
last few years, and I think TCP/IP will have the next few years."
     Genesys' NetVectoring technology allows Internet platforms to
essentially send orders to the signaling network.  Genesys has
demonstrated an application that allows an Internet user to click a
button on a company's web page and generate a voice call through the
public network to the company's call center.  The Internet application
passes data on both ends of the desired connection to the SS7 network,
allowing it to set up the call.  During the call, the same application
would be able to tell the signaling network when more bandwidth was
needed, to add a video connection to the call for example.
     In this vision, the old argument about whether the intelligence
should be in the network or in the terminals is sidestepped. 
NetVectoring works by integrating intelligence in both locations.  "In
order to achieve [dynamic bandwidth control] you need the central
network intelligence to be able to collaborate with some intelligence
that's working within the application itself," said Pickering, "which
tends to be in the originator's point or the terminator's point." 

  ...A Voice Traffic Lane on the Superhighway

     The integration of "endpoint intelligence" into the intelligent
network can provide more elegant solutions to some problems than AIN
alone can offer.  For example, the ability to dynamically share the
bandwidth of a single connection among several devices has the
potential to reduce the need for individually numbered connections and
ease the number exhaust problem.  Such applications will distribute
call routing intelligence beyond the SS7 network, and require a fairly
close connection between the SS7 network and the Internet, as well as
other data networks.
     Although the process may not be complete by the end of 1996, it
is likely that the Internet will evolve into a kind of meta-network
running in parallel with other, more specialized networks, including
the SS7 signaling network and the circuit switched voice network. 
Both these networks will continue to play a role, since they are
optimized to perform critical communications functions, but their
ultimate position may be as specialized sections of a sophisticated
and highly intelligent multimedia network.

UNISYS AND BELLCORE TEAM TO OFFER NEW NETWORK MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES

     Unisys Corp. and Bellcore have formed a strategic alliance under
which they will integrate the NIRIS platform, a Unisys product used to
collect and examine SS7 network information, with Bellcore's NetMavin
link monitoring software.  The result will be a generic, network wide,
operations support system that promises to give carriers more control
than ever before over their SS7 network traffic.  Immediate
applications are expected in fraud prevention and traffic load
control, but the NIRIS/NetMavin combination will also allow new
applications in areas from billing to marketing.

  ...One More Network on the Top

     The alliance makes it possible to combine the local level
monitoring capability of the existing NIRIS platform with the high
level intelligence of NetMavin.  NIRIS platforms are already deployed
in some carriers' networks where they generally operate alongside a
Signal Transfer Point (STP).  Acting essentially as a packet sniffer,
the NIRIS platform reads all incoming SS7 traffic as it passes through
the STP link and collects it as necessary.
     "Through the basic component of the NIRIS platform, the data is
collected, filtered, and massaged to some degree and passed off to the
applicable application program that's looking for certain pieces of
information," explained Jerry Parker, director of sales for NIRIS at
Unisys.
     This capability is expanded to cover the entirety of the
carrier's infrastructure by networking these individual NIRIS units
together -- using a traditional wide area network -- and connecting
them to a central application server running NetMavin.  The combined
solution will allow carriers to search their networks for particular
kinds of messages and collect them at a single point to perform
analyses in near real time that can describe the status of the entire
network.

  ...Right, Now Pay Attention 007

     The NIRIS platforms do much more than passively absorb and
retransmit messages, however.  It would hardly be practical to
duplicate the entire traffic load of the SS7 signaling network and aim
it across a WAN at an application server.  Thus the NIRIS platforms
actively study the information they are receiving and only send
messages to the application server that are relevant to what it is
trying to do.  "The most effective place to collect [data] is near the
STP site," said Bellcore's Product Manager for NetMavin Mike Myers. 
"They usually have between 50 and 200 signaling links coming into a
certain STP, so you monitor the links there.  One of the tricks when
you're dealing with this massive amount of data is to effectively
manage it.  You only want to copy what we call 'interesting' or
'important' messages, and a message doesn't have to be copied multiple
times; it can be reused by each application as necessary."
     The benefits of this capability for carriers could be immense. 
"In a big network, it's not atypical for several hundred million
messages to be flowing every single day," said Myers.  "This is an
incredible source of data for a large service provider that is
presently untapped, so the joint solution is a unique way to get this
data and use it to the corporation's best advantage."
     One of the most obvious applications, and the one with the most
immediate impact on carrier bottom lines, is fraud prevention.  The
only other system capable of tracking calls across the entire network
is the billing system.  While the billing system might detect fraud
when it generates a massive monthly bill for a subscriber, the damage
is already done.
     The NIRIS/NetMavin combination will be able to pick out fraud as
it is happening.  One example that Myers cites is illegal call
resellers who operate in large metropolitan areas.  "They'll open up
an apartment or a storefront, and they'll advertise on the street that
you can call anywhere in the world for $10 an hour," Myers explained. 
"They'll have multiple lines in there, and they'll just pump calls 24
hours a day into the network.  Today's scenario is at the end of the
month, when the bills come in, the service provider realizes that this
person owes them a quarter of a million dollars.  Of course by the
time they send the bill to the customer, that person's long gone."
     The NIRIS/NetMavin combination would be able to detect the sudden
appearance of massive call volumes from a particular location, and
compare the traffic to specified criteria to decide if it should alert
a security agent.  

  ...Other Applications Await

     Fraud control is only one application area for the system, which
will serve as a generic support infrastructure.  It will also perform
tasks such as monitoring traffic for sudden surges and helping
reconstruct the conditions that created an outage so that similar
outages can be prevented in the future.  Even marketing applications
will be possible as carriers use the system to mine the tremendous
amount of data they already generate on millions of individual
transactions with customers.
     "What we're talking about today is really the first wave in using
that data effectively," said Myers, who described the philosophy of
the system as a "bit of a paradigm shift."  Instead of having the
telephone company buy "focused solutions" in which a single tool is
acquired to solve a single problem, the NIRIS/NetMavin combination
will offer a range of applications to be used by "wildly disparate
people within the telephone company.  This solution won't just solve
problems for one small part of the company," said Myers.  (Oliver
Picher, Unisys, 215/986-5367; Annie Lindstrom, Bellcore, 201/829-
4062.)

BELLCORE PURSUES INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS

     In addition to making partnerships within its traditional segment
of the industry, Bellcore is also furiously expanding into
international markets, as well as going outside the voice business
entirely.  In the last month, Bellcore has announced several key
partnerships and contracts:

*    A contract with Telkom South Africa under which Bellcore will
     provide intelligent networking consulting during 1996.  Telkom
     South Africa is currently implementing IN functionality in its
     network to serve corporate customers with such services as
     virtual private networks and toll-free calling.  Services are
     planned for deployment in 1996 and 1997.

*    A letter of intent to form a strategic alliance with the Ministry
     of Economic Affairs (MOEA) of Taiwan, Republic of China. 
     Bellcore will work with the MOEA on a series of cooperative
     development projects and jointly pursue business opportunities in
     the Asia-Pacific region.  Because of restrictions of the Modified
     Final Judgement (MFJ), Bellcore would work only on projects to be
     marketed outside the United States.

*    Separate Statements of Principle with Sun Microsystems and
     Netscape Communications Corp. under which Bellcore will combine
     its expertise with both companies in pursuit of opportunities in
     the Internet marketplace.  Bellcore plans to become a member of
     Sun's Independent Software Vendor Program and will provide
     systems integration consulting based on Netscape's Internet
     software.

BELLSOUTH ASKS FCC FOR PERMISSION TO OFFER OPEN AIN ACCESS.  

     BellSouth has filed a petition with the Federal Communications
Commission for expedited waiver of Part 69 rules in order to offer
open AIN access to third party AIN service developers.  The waiver
would clear the way for BellSouth to offer its DesignEdge service and
Basic AIN Programmability (BAP) Toolkit as tariffed services, and for
BellSouth itself to offer services built with the toolkit.  DesignEdge
and the toolkit are the first stage in a three-stage evolution to open
AIN access that BellSouth has long planned.  Providers would use the
toolkit to develop services -- using a limited set of AIN triggers and
logic modules -- which would be loaded into BellSouth's SCPs and run
on its network. (John Goldman, BellSouth, 205/977-5007)

UPSURGE IN PERSONAL NUMBERING PREDICTED

     Up to 4 million people in the United Kingdom alone will have a
portable telephone number within the next seven years, according to
Peter Gelardi, managing director of World Telecom plc, a supplier of
calling card and other value added services.  In his opening address
to the Universal Personal Telephony Conference, held in London in
December, Gelardi predicted that the rapid spread of personal
numbering will impact on employment prospects in the United Kingdom,
and have a profound effect on the British workplace.  This is because
parallel software developments will make the traditional message-
taking role of the secretary obsolete as screening and returning of
calls in person becomes much easier.
     Gelardi added that, "aligned to the growth of personal numbering
and the advent of number portability, what will be profitable for
telecommunications providers is value-added services rather than the
carrying of traffic, which ultimately will be free in the future."

FIRST EUROPEAN CONTRACT FOR TPS

     U.K. cellular operator Cellnet has signed a contract with
Telecommunications Premium Services Ltd. (TPS) of Slough, United
Kingdom, for the provision of an advanced personal communications
service to be launched during the first quarter of 1996.  The
contract, the first won in Europe by TPS Ltd. since its launch in
April 1995, is expected to be worth approximately Pounds 10 million
($15.6 million) in the first three to five years. 
     The new service, called Cellnet Personal Assistant, is expected
to attract some 10,000 subscribers in its first year, rising to
"several hundred thousand" within three years.  The service provides
single number contact for all calls -- voice, e-mail and fax.  It also
screens calls; takes messages if the call is not connected; and
immediately notifies the user by pager, short message service (SMS) or
e-mail.  According to TPS, the service can connect more than 50
percent of calls on the first attempt, compared with a U.K. average of
20 percent.

INTELLIGENT PRIVATE NETWORK FROM BOSCH 

     Bosch Telecom has launched the Integral 33XE, a digital
telecommunications system which uses ISDN technology to create an
intelligent private network (IPN).  With the new IPN technology, Bosch
can combine the benefits of both virtual private networks (VPNs) and
private circuits without their costs.  Integral 33XE enables remote
locations to be networked via ISDN, carrying speech, data, and visual
communications.
     The Integral 33XE system incorporates a new range of digital
telephones that are Microsoft TAPI compliant.  The phones include
computer connections and will work with Windows-based applications
software.

AMERITECH TO TEST PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Ameritech, the latest Bell regional holding company (RHC) to announce a test
of personal communications service (PCS), will attempt an ambitious, two-year
program beginning with simple, one-way calling and ending with two-way calling
that allows roaming.

Similar to Millicom's Orlando., Fla., test, Ameritech's network will operate
in the 1850-1990 megaHertz range, now used by fixed-point microwave operators.

The RHC said it will conduct both technical and marketing trials in the
Chicago area.  Chicago was chosen because of its "high concentration of
multiple types of radio traffic, a large variety of ... structures (including
high-rise buildings) and a complex customer base," Ameritech said.

In its most sophisticated form, the PCS will be able to make use of signaling
system 7 and integrated services digital network (ISDN), the RHC said.  It did
not say how the microcell channels would accommodate the greater bandwidth
requirements of ISDN and intelligent-network services.  Like most proposals
for experimental PCSs, Ameritech's request gave little technical detail.

The company would not say what manufacturer will supply the microcell base
stations, interfaces to the public switched telephone network and hand-held
phones.

Nor has the RHC determined where in the city it will start its test or when it
will begin, although it did say that it would conclude operations within two
years

Ameritech said it would test three different services.  The first, and most
rudimentary, is similar to Britain's telepoint service.  Users will be able
make and receive calls at home and make calls within 25 to 100 yards of
telepoint-type public base stations.

The second phase will add an alert signal to let a customer know that a call
is coming in.  As with the first phase, hand-off capability between cells will
not be available. The third stage network will allow customers to make and
receive calls from their homes and all public base stations and will have
hand-off capability.

Ultimately, up to 100 cell sites, each 50 to 200 yards in diameter, and 1,000
portable handsets may be used.

The RHC also will experiment with sending low-speed data over PCS, said Dave
Connolly, Ameritech Services manager of corporate strategy.

An important part of the trial will be testing what customers are willing to
pay for each type of service.  "We've had some people say, 'I don't want
two-way service.'  They don't want their phone going off in public," Connolly
said.

How To Please Everyone?

Ameritech envisions offering a variety of PCS services, he added. "At home,
they may want full, two-way service like their regular phone.  Outside the
home they may want something else."

Which presents Ameritech with the formidable problem of letting the customer
change service at will.  To arrange that, Ameritech will rely heavily on
intelligence within its wireline network.

"When you read the other [PCS] filings and they ask for personal
communications networks, they're asking for a specific type of service with
switching and intelligence and databases," Connolly said.  "We want to use our
own [wireline] network for that to keep the radio network simpler."

By testing increasingly complicated systems, the RHC also will face the
difficulty of finding one or more manufacturers who will develop products to
order, Connolly noted.  Sticking with one manufacturer would simplify matters,
but "We're going to see how things develop and who can to what for us" before
deciding, he said.

The company emphasized that it will develop an interface between the radio
systems and its wireline network that will allow furnishing ISDN and
out-of-band signaling.

At today's state of the art, however, Ameritech won't be able to provide true
"2B+D" service over the channels covering just 50 MHz of radio spectrum.
Customers probably will not be able to use their PCS phones to transmit voice
and data at the same time, Connolly said, "But even one "B" plus "D" is better
than other proposals,"  The D channel could be used to provide information
about signal strength and facilitate hand-off, he said.  And
intelligent-network services such as call forwarding, selective call blocking
and caller ID also would be possible.

PCS SUGGESTIONS ARE PERFECTLY CLEAR -- NOBODY AGREES

The personal communications service (PCS) comments submitted to the FCC Oct. 1
set a landmark of sorts.  Rarely have so many parties intensely held such
different views about what a new service is or should be.  Roughly 100
personal communications service (PCS) comments, comprising some 3,000 pages,
submitted to the FCC Oct. 1, testify to the discord.

But on one thing commentors agree:  Consumers want new wireless services.
According to figures furnished by Motorola, there are more than 100 million
communications devices (excluding CB and toys) in use today.  Land mobile
accounts for 48 million subscribers, as of Jan. 1, 1990.

Over 50 million cordless telephones are in service.  And cellular subscribers
have passed the 4-million mark.  Motorola projects that these combined
categories will grow from 100 million to almost 500 million by the end of this
decade.  That would equal nearly one wireless device for every two local
access lines. Millicom backs up its contention with a study from Arthur D.
Little which indicates that 40 percent of all U.S. households would subscribe
to PCN if it were priced $10 above existing telephone service.  The percentage
dropped to 14 if the service were priced at $40 above existing telephone
service.

CT-2, or outgoing, telepoint-type systems; digital European cordless
technology (DECT), a CT-2 variation accepted in Europe; and personal
communications service (PCS) proponents are joined by cellular carriers,
telephone companies and private radio service providers in their optimism
about the vast market potential for both wireless devices and services.
That's where agreement stops.  As a result, PCS is sure to be built on a
foundation of controversy.

The Miles-Per-Hour Spectrum

GTE, for instance, sees PCS in "miles-per-hour" categories.  That is, the
speeds at which mobile users are moving.  It characterizes today's cellular
service as a "60 mph service," in which customers are moving at high speeds
over wide areas.  To GTE, a new "6 mph service" is emerging that will meet
pedestrian needs -- a local offering designed for short walking distances.
Finally, GTE envisions a "zero mph service" that would be used in specific
locations.  Wireless PBX or wireless building networks fall under this
category.

In contrast, McCaw Communications, one of the largest non-wireline cellular
carriers in the country, envisions PCS as a continuum of mobile services
integrated into a seamless network. In this plan, cellular provides the core
network on which new microcellular PCS services will be introduced.
Pedestrian and in-building needs should be met by existing cellular spectrum
or through new spectrum for cellular carriers.

Telephone companies have a fundamentally different view.  They see wireless
services as a new means of accessing the established public switched network.
These "tetherless" access systems would consist of residential- or
business-area transceivers which would:  1) be a substitute for local loops,
2) replace in-building wiring with more flexible systems,  3) provide local
area computer networks,  4) meet needs of special communities such as trailer
parks, marinas, resorts and convention centers, and  5) provide a less
expensive form of telephone service to remote areas, now referred to as basic
exchange telephone service.

The telephone companies insist that PCSs are best built upon the telephone
infrastructure of the future with its digital switching, integrated services
digital network transmission, signaling system 7 and intelligent-network
capabilities.

New Kid On The Block

Millicom and other PCS proponents have a radically different concept in mind.
To them, PCS will be a stand-alone, digital network of advanced microcellular
networks.  Local-exchange telephone service would be a competitive business
opportunity, not an infrastructure to be built upon.

CT-2 and DECT advocates argue that pedestrian-based services can offer
improved residential cordless services, new public payphone services and
in-building telecommunications.  They complain that industry analysts are
unfairly denigrating their capabilities and overstating the ability of PCS and
cellular to meet such needs.

Private radio service providers are concerned that the commission's notice of
inquiry talks about common-carrier services without leaving adequate room for
private-carrier provision of PCS.  Private carriage may be appropriate in
cases such as self-contained, in-building networks. Cordless telephone
manufacturers simply want out of the PCS debate.  They worry that the
Telecommunications Industry Association's request for new 46-49 MHz
frequencies will be delayed and ensnared in the PCS melee.

As if these different visions of PCS weren't enough cause for debate, the
comments reveal sharply contrasting technical, spectrum-allocation,
eligibility and federal/state jurisdiction issues.

Will It Work?

Three basic technical approaches for PCS are suggested.  Not one of them,
however, has been field tested in a real-life situation. Qualcomm advocates
code division multiple access (CDMA), a digital, spread-spectrum technology
that permits numerous calls on one channel.  CDMA would permit PCSs to share
frequencies with existing services, its advocates say.

Motorola, GTE and AT&T question whether CDMA can operate without its own
exclusive spectrum allocation.  Millicom's test in Orlando, Fla., where a
version of PCS will be tested in the private, fixed microwave range, may
resolve the question. Time division multiple access (TDMA) systems similarly
do not emerge unscathed.  Motorola, McCaw and others note that TDMA has not
been adequately tested.

Centel has announced another variant -- "narrow advanced mobile phone systems"
(NAMPS). NAMPS, an analog technology, would use discrete portions of the
cellular bands for microcellular applications.  The technology, developed by
Motorola, will be tested next year in Las Vegas. A fourth option, only hinted
at to date, is frequency hopping. AT&T has indicated it will explore this
technology.

In short, no one really is sure what CDMA, TDMA, NAMPS or frequency hopping
can offer.  They must undergo a wide variety of tests in the lab and in the
field.  Until test results are in, the agency can't answer questions such as
whether spectrum sharing is possible or how many PCSs technically could be
accommodated in any given market.  The last point clearly affects whether or
not PCS spectrum scarcity is real or perceived. The FCC specified 1850-1990
MHz as a potential home for PCS.  But none of those holding licenses to
operate in that spectrum are stepping forward to volunteer to relocate.  In
fact, law enforcement agencies, petroleum companies, railroads, broadcasters,
public utilities and others have all argued that it would be prohibitively
expensive and technically dubious for them to be evicted from or forced to
share their spectrum.

Stunting Growth

In addition, private and common carrier land mobile operators want to hang on
to the three unused 1 MHz slices of spectrum in the 900 MHz band that the FCC
has suggested using for CT-2 and DECT.  They need it, they say, to handle
specialized mobile radio and paging growth.

Here, engineering fades and a political question appears:  Does the FCC have
the will and fortitude to act in the face of such opposition?

Assuming the FCC finds new spectrum for PCS, the most contentious issue of all
looms -- Who will be allowed to file for new spectrum?  The FCC's notice
offers two tentative possibilities. First, to promote competition, cellular
carriers would be barred from using new PCS spectrum to expand their systems.
Second, some new spectrum might be set aside for local telephone companies to
introduce new telephone services.

Telephone companies, of course, support a telephone-company set-aside.
Non-wireline cellular carriers strenuously oppose any prohibition that would
prevent them from applying for new spectrum within their own cellular markets.

If The nature of the game and the rules are settled, that still leaves the
question of referees.  State utility commissions argue against any FCC
preemptions or classification of PCSs as private radio services.  That would
automatically preclude state regulation under Section 332 of the
Communications Act.  They are joined by rural independent telephone companies
concerned about PCS as bypass threats.

The plain fact is that there aren't many hard facts in the opening comments.
Nor is it likely that such information will materialize in time for the Dec. 1
reply comments.  Given this state of affairs, the commission is left either to
remain idle until tests are finished or to take a more active role and set
guidelines. -- Nancy J. Victory

LO-JACK SEARCHES FOR STOLEN VEHICLES, UNCOVERS PRODUCT DEMAND

It's pretty rare to have a stolen car recovered an hour and a half after
thieves take it, but that is the average time it takes police to track down
cars equipped with small, hidden transmitters sold by Lo-Jack Corp., of
Needham, Mass.

When an owner reports a Lo-Jack-equipped car as stolen, police transmit unique
code to the Lo-Jack unit in the vehicle, "waking" it up.  It begins
broadcasting a regular, pulsing signal over the low end of the FM band.

Patrol cars pick up the signal on special Lo-Jack receivers, which print out
the stolen car's description and vehicle identification number.

A compass-like device in the patrol car points in the direction of the stolen
car, indicating which way to turn to home in on it.

Since the company began selling them in Massachusetts in 1988, 50,000 Lo-Jack
units have been installed, and 1,200 stolen cars have been retrieved -- a 95
percent success rate -- the company says.

Lo-Jack sells its transmitters through new-car dealers and provides the
patrol-car receivers and related equipment to police departments for a nominal
$1 charge.

With 15 million new vehicles sold each year in the U.S. -- and a car stolen
every 30 seconds -- Lo-Jack has tapped into a lucrative market, says
securities analyst Jyoti Aggarwala, whose firm, Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., of
New York, recommends Lo-Jack stock as a long-term investment. If the company
wins just 1 percent of the new car market, it will garner $45 million
annually, she estimates.

But Lo-Jack, which went public in 1983, has yet to show a profit, largely
because it must spend about $2 million each time it enters a new state,
according to company president Michael Daley. Lo-Jack's current strategy is to
focus on stolen-vehicle recovery, not vehicle location.  It strives to get its
systems adopted by police agencies, preferably the state police, in what Daley
terms the "top 10 states," where 60 percent of the nation's auto sales and
thefts occur.

Though it only expanded outside Massachusetts in 1988, Lo-Jack already has
recruited police departments in Miami, Chicago and Detroit, and anticipates an
agreement with state police in Illinois, where 63,000 cars were stolen in
1988. Daley and Aggarwala agree that Lo-Jack should be profitable by 1992.

By then, however, Lo-Jack may be feeling the heat from some competitors.  So
far there is one entry: the Intercept system from Code-Alarm of Madison
Heights, Mich.

Sounding The Alarm

When an Intercept-equipped car is stolen, a transmitter hidden in the vehicle
begins broadcasting the car's location to Code-Alarm's headquarters, using the
cellular telephone network. The module knows the car is stolen because other
sensors on the car have been tripped, explains Mary Gingrich, Code-Alarm's
operations coordinator.

The module knows its location because it receives the broadcasts of the Loran
C network, a nationwide radio navigation system used by aircraft and boats,
which also covers one-third of the land area of the continental United States.

Code-Alarm headquarters, in turn, notifies local police of the stolen car's
location and even its speed.

Gingrich says that, if police approve, Code-Alarm can tell the Intercept
module to shut off the gas to the car's motor, bringing any chase to a
grinding halt.

Other competitors with products in the works include an Indianapolis, Ind.,
firm named MITS Inc. and International Tele-trac systems, which is testing a
cellular-based system for tracking fleet vehicles that Daley says could easily
be adapted to tracking stolen ones.

Of these, Teletrac's could represent a major threat because of Teletrac's
partnership with PacTel Corp., the cellular telephone subsidiary of Bell
regional holding company (RHC) Pacific Telesis.  (Lo-Jack has challenged that
partnership as a violation of the AT&T Consent Decree's ban on the provision
of information services by RHCs.)

Lo-Jack suffers a disadvantage over such competitors, noted Dennis Zogbi, an
analyst with the U.S. Market Perspective division of World Information
Technologies in Northport, N.Y. "Owners have to notify police before a search
for a car begins. If somebody steals a car at night, the owner may not be
aware of it until morning.  In New York City, most cars stolen in Manhattan
are driven into New Jersey and disassembled in "chop shops" within 30
minutes."

Element Of Surprise

Daley acknowledged the potential problem, but said that Lo-Jack owners have
had little difficulty in actual practice.  "We don't perceive it as a
weakness," he said.  "We have recovered cars within hours, days and weeks of
being stolen without damage.  The thief doesn't know whether a driver has left
a car for a few minutes or a long time."

Thieves also don't know if the car is equipped with Lo-Jack, and aren't likely
to take the time for a thorough search, Daley said. "In this state
[Massachusetts] we've had thieves steal the car, then drive it somewhere to
cool off.  They go back in several days to see if it's still there."

In real life, more sophisticated systems such as Code Alarm's have
difficulties, too, Daley said.  "The owner must set codes on leaving the car
and returning."  If not, the alarm goes off.  If the owner forgets the code or
a family member who doesn't know the code takes the car, a false alarm may
result.

In any case, there is still a delay.  "The police must contact the owner to
verify that it is, in fact, a stolen vehicle.  The police don't want to be
embarrassed or be sued for false arrest," Daley said. "And since they operate
on cellular, they can only be used in cities or areas of heavy vehicle
traffic," he noted.

In confronting these competitors, Lo-Jack will likely maintain a decided price
advantage, Agarwalla notes.  Its Lo-Jack Retrieve product, the transmitter,
sells for $595, including installation, which Lo-Jack representatives do
themselves, randomly concealing the device in one of 35 locations on the car.
There are no monthly charges because the unit is used only if police activate
a hunt for it.

For customers in Massachusetts and Florida, the deal is even better:
Insurance companies there give those who also buy Lo-Jack's optional $100
Lo-Jack Prevent product, a theft-prevention device, at least a 25 percent
reduction in the cost of their comprehensive auto insurance coverage.

And, if the customer's car is stolen and not retrieved, any Lo-Jack customer
gets his Lo-Jack investment refunded. By comparison, Code-Alarm's Intercept
costs $1,495, including installation and a cellular telephone.

Lo-Jack scored a coup last year when the FBI, at Lo-Jack's request, persuaded
the FCC to designate a special frequency (173.075 megaHertz) for use
nationwide by Lo-Jack's small transmitters.

Daley says the FCC's action will smooth police acceptance of the devices,
eliminating the need to gain a specific FCC license for each state.

For the future, Daley says Lo-Jack will "expand this network till we cover one
end of the country to the other," largely by winning the involvement of police
agencies along major transportation corridors on both coasts and along
Interstate 80 through the Midwest and West, he says.

Lo-Jack, he adds, is also discussing cooperative arrangements with European
police agencies, and, one day, would like to expand the use of its technology
to recover stolen aircraft and boats. Just last year, he notes, a Lo-Jack unit
installed in a truck led to the breakup of a hijacking ring when that truck
was stolen and tracked to a Florida warehouse.

Police found the truck in less than an hour, Daley says.

TELEPOINT-TYPE SYSTEMS MORE LIKELY TO BECOME PROFITABLE

A British consulting firm has concluded that telepoint-type systems, limited
though they are, are more likely to return profits to investors than personal
communications networks (PCN).

"We see a window of opportunity for telepoint," said Enda Hardiman, general
manager of telecommunications market analysis for London-based BIS Mackintosh.

Telepoint, as used in Britain, is a one-way telephone system accessed outside
the home.  Users move to within a few hundred yards of a base station
(typically mounted on a building) and make outgoing calls.

The keys to telepoint success, according to BIS, are its low cost compared to
personal communications and telepoint's proven technical feasibility.  Three
such systems have been operating in London for more than a year, noted Ian
Reese, author of an analysis comparing telepoint to PCN.  In contrast, no PCNs
have been put into commercial service or given field tests.

"PCN operators are caught between a rock and a hard place," Hardiman said.
The current estimate to produce a PCN phone, which can receive calls as well
as make them, is about $3,000, he said.  A telepoint phone, which is limited
to placing outgoing calls, costs about $400.

PCN operators are either going to have to retain a high price for the phones
or subsidize them with income from high airtime charges, Hardiman said.

Because PCN must be considered a riskier investment than telepoint, operators
will have to pay higher interest rates to investors, according to Reese.  As a
result, a PCN system large enough to cover 60 million people (about the
population of Great Britain and Ireland combined) would become profitable nine
or 10 years after startup.

Getting The Payback

A telepoint system of equal capacity, on the other hand, would begin making
money in its sixth year, according to Reese's analysis.

"Unlike telepoint, PCN is unproven, and the rational investor should attach a
high level of risk to investment in PCN," BIS said.

PCN is seen as a much larger system, attracting some seven million subscribers
by the end of the seventh year of operation, as opposed to 600,000 telepoint
subscribers in the same period.

Revenue per subscriber would be about the same, however. Telepoint subscribers
are projected to pay about $700 a year for airtime, whereas PCN subscribers
would pay about $800, according to Reese.  The telepoint figure matches
revenues quoted by current system operators.  The PCN estimate is based upon
average use of cellular telephones in the United Kingdom.

BIS estimates that the hypothetical PCN would realize a profit of about $100
million in its first year in the black, or 3.6 percent of total investment.

By the end of the same period, telepoint would increase in value about 75
percent, Reese said.  That corresponds to an increase in value of about $104
million on an investment of $140 million. The sizeable increase can be
attributed to predicted profit margins.  "Like other telecommunications
infrastructure investments, once the major initial capital outlays have been
recovered there is considerable potential for large and sustained profits as
the service matures," BIS said.

"PCN must, for the time being, be regarded as a high-risk investment with
uncertain long-term yield prospects," Reese concluded.

Bell Atlantic, which proposes to begin a telepoint field test in Philadelphia
in December, had no estimates of demand for service or when a commercial
system might become profitable. "At this time, we're just testing the
technology," a spokeswoman said.

PAC TEL PROPOSES MOST EXTENSIVE U.S. PCS TEST

Pacific Telesis has proposed a two-year, five-city research project into
personal communications service (PCS) radio frequency (RF) propagation and
systems performance.

Pac Tel applied for an experimental license on the eve of the Oct. 1 deadline
for comments on the FCC's inquiry into advanced wireless technology.

"PCS is more than just wireless cellular," said Stagg Newman, Pac Tel's
assistant vice president for corporate strategy.

Pac Tel wants to "provide a 'global' picture of radio propagation and
interference characteristics at different frequencies," he said.  The systems
tests are designed to "provide an understanding of the new PCS system
alternatives, including propagation characteristics, system capabilities,
functionality, economies and preliminary user acceptance," the company said.

Although Pac Tel, Pacific Bell and PacTel Cellular will focus on advanced
wireless communications, many of the features contemplated will rely on
intelligent network capabilities. If Pac Tel's experimental license is
granted, testing will start with examinations of how signals of various
frequencies and power levels behave in different cities, starting with San
Francisco and Los Angeles and reaching across the country to Chicago, Dallas
and New York.

Narrowband and wideband testing will be done in the following frequency
ranges: 614-806 megaHertz (now allocated to UHF television), 824-849 MHz and
869-894 MHz (cellular telephone services), 849-851 MHz and 894-896 MHz
(air-to-ground services), 864-868 MHz (public safety and specialized mobile
radio).

Also, 901-902 MHz, 930-931 MHz and 940-941 MHz (general purpose mobile radio
and advanced paging) 902-928 MHz (industrial, scientific and medical [ISM]
services, automatic vehicle location and amateur radio), 1850-1990 MHz
(point-to-point microwave), 2110-2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz (point-to-point
microwave) and 2400-2483.5 (ISM and low-power or spread-spectrum uses).

Pac Tel will seek out "challenging RF environments" to test propagation and
interference characteristics.  "These tests  will encompass five metropolitan
areas, each with distinct topography, and will include a combination of
in-building, on-street and unique coverage situations at ranges of less than
and greater than one kilometer," the company said.

The tests will attempt to answer some of the questions the FCC posed in its
PCS inquiry, namely:  "Can PCS be overlaid within existing spectrum
allocations on a shared basis?" and "Can multiple spread spectrum operators
share the same spectrum?"

Newman said these tests will attempt to settle the debate about whether
spread-spectrum technologies can, in practice, share the same frequencies as
point-to-point microwave.

Seeing Double

The second phase of Pac Tel's testing proposal will focus on tests of at least
two "technology platforms" and will reflect experience gathered from the RF
propagation and interference research.  About 100 handsets and 20 to 30 base
stations will be established for each technology in a given city.

The basic system will offer a "low-end, low-functionality" service with small,
low-cost handsets providing an "enhanced version of CT-2," according to
Newman.  The second will be a "high-end, next-generation cellular" service
complete with "intelligent network functionality," he said.

TELEZONE SET TO BEGIN IN 1992

American TeleZone will begin public service in two years, according to CEO
Robert Gray.  Others are anticipating service launches in 1995.

TeleZone is aiming to avoid the FCC's personal comunications inquiry and the
process of licensing equipment.  The company's one-way, telepoint-type system
will operate under Part 15 of the FCC's rules, governing devices such as
model-airplane controls, which do not require licenses.

TeleZone's greatest lure will be price.  "We plan [to offer] unlimited calls
for $50 a month, and we can go a whole lot lower than that," Gray said.

ACT TO TEST CT-2 PBX

The first company in the country to operate an experimental telepoint-type
system will test wireless PBXs early next year, according to its founder.

American Cordless Technology (ACT), Montville, N.J., has received FCC and New
York State Public Service Commission permission to operate an experimental
CT-2 system in Manhattan, said Matt Edwards, the company's president.  ACT
expects to begin service in "early 1991," Edwards said.

The company plans to cover Manhattan south of the Brooklyn Bridge and the
region's three main airports: Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark, Edwards said.

ACT plans to install roughly 200 base stations.  Most will go on the outside
of buildings but 50 will be placed on already installed PBXs.

COMSAT, BELL ATLANTIC TEAM UP

Comsat and Bell Atlantic have joined to build an emergency radiotelephone
network.  The National Transportable Telecommunications Capability will use
existing cellular and satellite products to provide communications to federal
agencies during natural disasters or civil emergencies.

Comsat is to provide Ku-band satellite links to the public telephone network,
fixed earth stations, a digital telephone system and microwave transmission.
Bell Atlantic will provide cellular switching, cell base stations, towers,
antennas and cellular phones.

The whole thing goes in a package that can fit on a C-130 cargo airplane.

BRITS START PCN OPERATORS' GROUP

The three companies licensed to establish personal communications networks in
the United Kingdom have formed an organization to promote use of their
transmission standard in other European nations.  The Association of European
PCN Operators consists of Unitel, Mercury and Microtel.

One objective of the association is roaming service for subscribers.  DCS
(digital cellular system) 1800 will operate at 1.8 GHz and is based on 900 MHz
GSM, the standard for the proposed Pan European Digital Cellular System.

GIANTS ENGAGE IN BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

The Japanese telecommunications service market is set for change as
the country's two telecommunications giants, Kokusai Denshin Denwa
(KDD) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) battle for dominance
NTT announced at the end of August it would launch an international
multimedia service ahead of domestic international carriers, and a
possible tie-up with several major international carriers.

In a counter-offensive, KDD announced a plan to circle Japan with a
new submarine cable called J-I-H in collaboration with regional
carriers such as Tokyo Telecommunication Network(TT-Net). This
would expand the number of landing points it has from seven to 20
and challenge domestic long-distance carriers like NTT. KDD
estimates a 10 per cent share of the market with investments at 100
billion yen (US$93.4 billion). The J-I-H cable will not be in place
until 1999, but KDD does have another option for entering the
market-its microwave network which is already in place.

ONSE TELECOM-NEW POWER IN KOREA

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Newly-established Onse Telecommunications Corporation, is expected
to be awarded long-distance and local service telecommunication
licences by the end of this year. This is in addition to the
international service licence it was awarded in summer.

The licenses would enable Onse to become the third major
telecommunications power in the Korean wired communications market
after Korea Telecom and Dacom . The award to a relatively unknown
entity such as Onse has raised questions about the company's
ability to compete with telecommunication giants like Korea Telecom
and Dacom.

Onse has eight major shareholders and few have any experience in
the country's telecommunications business: These include Haitai,
Halla, Lotte, Korea Electric Power (KEPCO), Asea Cement, Daeryung,
and Ko Hai.

Already, Asea and Daeryung have announced a merger which would give
them a 30 per cent voting interest, but this grouping is unlikely
to wrestle controlling power from KEPCO.

JAPAN'S PHS GEARS UP FOR DATACOMS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Japan's PHS service is gearing up for a new phase with the
introduction of new high-speed data communications products from
Kyocera and DDI Pocket.

Kyocera announced that it will launch the country's first PHS
handset with an internal modem card. Its Datacope handset will be
capable of receiving, displaying and sending e-mail at up to 2,400
bps.

In a related development, DDI Pocket will offer PHS handset
adapters this December. The adapters will allow PHS handsets (eg.
the Datacope) 14.4 Kbps data transmission capability. The company
expects at least two other makers to have similar models out by
year's end.

PHS advocates believe the system is the ideal mobile handset
service for accessing the Internet and multimedia. The system was
designed to communicate at 32,000 bps, but users can only transmit
or receive data at up to 9,600 bps at present.

PHS handsets capable of transmitting at 32,000 bps are expected to
appear next spring after interface specifications for the system
are completed and announced by the PHS Internet Access Forum before
the end of the year.

KOREA TELECOM'S NEW VISION IN TROUBLE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY MIKE GALBRAITH

BARELY three months after it unveiled its long-term vision-called
"KT Vision 2005"-Korea Telecom (KT) is having severe short-term
problems regarding the implementation of old rudimentary
privatisation plans set in motion several years ago.

The vision paints a rosy picture of the company's future as a
successful private company, and outlines three main goals-30
trillion won (US$3.84 trillion) in revenues, a global management
system and lifelong benefits for employees by the year 2005.

Despite the desperate need of the Ministry of Finance and Economy
(MOFE) to tap the privatisation of KT as a key source of funds,
even the transfer of a significant share of the company's stock
into private hands is making little progress. In the last two
years, nothing has happened.

Union Challenge

More serious, though, has been the challenge to change mounted by
the labour union which has threatened to bring the country to a
halt. The union activists fear that privatisation will mean loss of
jobs, reduced benefits and job insecurity, and have found a number
of allies among extremist religious and student groups. The climax
of their activities was in June when they seized the office of the
Minister of Information and Communications.

KT Vision 2005

As a result, Korean president Kim Young-Sam sacked the president of
KT and installed Lee Joon, a former four-star general who was in
charge of the First Army. Lee Joon is taking the credit for "KT
Vision 2005".

Experts, however, believe that, so far, privatisation, and possibly
the new vision, are intended to be mainly cosmetic gestures to
distract attention from KT's troubles.

Others doubt that the company will be able to transform itself
successfully into the envisioned dynamic competitive carrier when
it really loses its monopolies. The big squeeze is already upon KT.

Competition started in the long distance business this year and the
government is even set to licence two carriers to enter the key
local call business by the end of this year.

It is believed that the strongly entrenched vested interests of
monopolies will not relinquish their benefits without a fight, and
Korean monopolies are showing themselves to be of an usually
resilient breed that are very hard to break up.

Therefore, the government is going to have great difficulty in
meeting its obligation to move KT into the private sector by 1998,
which it is committed to do under World Trade Organisation (WTO)
provisions.

OECD Membership

Failure to do so would also jeopardise Korea's claim to membership
of the OECD. With such powerful opposing forces in conflicting
motion, the near and medium-term weather in and around KT looks
distinctly cloudy.

BRIDGING YOUR BUSINESS WITH THE TELEPHONE SYSTEM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

A large transportation company provides improved customer service
utilising a simple screen pop based upon the calling line
identification (CLID) feature of ISDN.

As a customer calls in to request a pickup of a parcel, the account
representative automatically sees the customer's profile before the
call is answered.

This type of service can significantly reduce the call duration of
a standard parcel pickup request and removes the majority of the
repetitive components of the customer service representative's
daily routine.

Furthermore, this CTI customer has enhanced the database
application that the customer service representative uses so that
the database application automatically prompts the customer service
representative to discuss issues that the caller has inquired about
previously as well as additional information such as service
enhancements and parcel tracking.

Possible enhancements to this customer's configuration would be to
screen the incoming calls and review the customer numbers.

Premium customers (the 80/20 rule where 80 per cent of your
revenues are generated from 20 per cent of your customers) could be
queued with higher priority into the call center.

As well, an automated voice response system could be used to screen
callers looking for tracking information and parcel confirmation.

A credit card service bureau with local call centers in Japan, San
Francisco, New York, and Paris implemented a networked CTI solution
which provided a complete pay back in less than four months on long
distance toll charges alone.

This customer provides services for Japanese credit card holders.
As is typical in a service bureau, the agents are required to
provide a different level of service for different callers
depending on the services that the originating company contracted
with the service bureau.

In this particular case, the average call duration was eight
minutes as agents scrambled to determine the appropriate level of
service based on the callers profile.

The service bureau implemented a complete CTI solution in which a
SQL database was integrated with an voice response system and a
complete integrated network of call centers.

When an incoming call terminates on an agent, the SQL database will
be automatically triggered to enable the appropriate services for
the caller based upon the DNIS number and the callers
identification.

Depending on the callers' request, the caller inquiry could be
serviced locally or transferred (with the account data attached) to
a remote call center.

This configuration reduced the average call duration from eight
minutes down to three minutes per call and significantly enhanced
the professionalism of the call center.

Another CTI customer is a service center for a large multinational
semiconductor firm.

They have centrally located their Asian call centre and configured
a series of 1-800 telephone numbers from all Asia-Pacific countries
to centrally terminate upon the call center. The call center is
configured in teams which provide an account-focused service
center.

Each team handles calls from a particular country and/or account.
The customer uses a CTI technology to provide priority queuing for
the premiums customers, as well as basic ACD overflow capabilities
where, if all the team members are engaged, the calls will overflow
to another team/cell.

This CTI solution has provided a means for this customer to provide
a centralised call center which centralises the unique skills
required to support their customer, as well as enhancing the
services for previous customers.

Next Issue

Next month, we will take a look at the latest API-Javatel. This API
may turn out to be the best way  to ensure long term viability in
your CTI solution because Java will be supported on multiple
platforms. The Javatel API will support  multimedia transmission
over both the Internet and regular phone lines.

NORTEL CONTRACT

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Mandarin Communications, one of Hong Kong's six PCS licencees, has
awarded Nortel a contract worth HK$426 million (US$54.9 million)
for a DCS 1800 network. The DMS Supernode MSC network is expected
to be in place by mid 1997, when the operator is to roll out
services.

Concern

However, it is still unclear whether the Hong Kong market is
overcrowded; a concern to which Richard Siemens, Mandarin's deputy
chairman and managing director addressed: "A consolidation may be
noticeable in the near future with the weaker ones being swallowed
by the stronger PCS operators."

NOKIA TO SUPPLY TO HK PCS OPERATORS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Nokia is to supply the new digital cellular network equipment for P
Plus Communications, one of Hong Kong's new personal communications
services (PCS) license operators.

The initial value of Nokia's contract for phase one and two will
exceed US$30 million. Hong Kong's telecommunications regulator,
OFTA, officially handed over the PCS license to P Plus on Sep 30.

Nokia will supply P Plus with a complete personal Communication
Network (PCN) system which will be based on DCS 1800 technology.

The contract includes the switching platform, base station and
controllers, and the network management system. Nokia has already
started installing and testing the equipment.

hk to play vital role in china's telecommunication growth

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

HongKong Telecom's (HKT) biggest intangible asset is its
relationship with China, states a recent equity research report
published by an investment bank.

Salomon Brothers, recommending a 'buy' for the operator's shares to
stock players, predicts that HKT will play a major role in China's
cellular growth within the next 6-12 months, boosting its stocks,
which recently plummeted to an all-time low of HK$15 (US$1.9).

In the past, HKT has actively transferred equipment to the
mainland's various ministries of posts and telecommunications and
has also been instrumental in training the PTTs' engineering and
management staff.

The competitive pressure is rising in China, observes the report,
initiating potential new business ventures that will be thrown in
the direction of the Hong Kong operator.

At home, HKT's opportunities lie in its future businesses such as
interactive video-on-demand, home shopping and banking services, to
be introduced in mid-1997. These will raise network layout costs
tremendously, though it is believed that expected increase in
network traffic within Hong Kong will compensate for that cost. The
research also notes that the company is addressing issues such as
cost control to position itself strategically in the global telecom
market. According to Dan Sherman, regional telecommunications
analyst at Salomon Brothers, "HKT is lowering its cost structure
which alone should enable the company to exceed current
expectations. Growth earnings will be seen in the range of 13 to 15
per cent over the next three years".

Slashes in expenditure are coming through staff reduction by
retrenching 700 to 1100 heads per year until 1998; an upper target
of 13,500 job cuts is expected to be reached by end of 1998.

Other major cost cuts are being implemented by outsourcing its data
and technical services to IBM, allowing an estimated savings of
HK$50 million (US$6.45 million) per year, says the report.

ATM CHARGE BY GDC

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

US-based ATM switch specialist, General DataComm (GDC), is bringing
Apex-Strobos, its latest 25 Gbps ATM edge switch to the region. It
is currently vying for segments in vast ATM projects undertaken by
service providers like Hongkong Telecom.

In a recent agreement with Datacraft Asia, a regional systems
integrator, GDC will channelise its WAN and remote access products
into 10 countries within Asia Pacific.

In September this year, the two jointly lodged five separate
tenders for several major ATM backbone projects in a move to secure
major share in the rapidly deregulating Asian market.

GDC's chief operating officer, Ross Belson, intends to double his
company's 10 per cent revenue number from Asia Pacific within the
next year.

He said, "Our aim is to identify opportunities in huge potential
markets such as China, and at the same time provide constant
education to our customers who need to know about the constant
developments in areas such as telemedicine, remote site
videoconferencing and so on. We have bid for projects such as the
one with the ministry of health in China".

Experience

Belson believes Datacraft's experience and knowledge, especially in
the Chinese market will allow it to grab the market share it is
aiming for, even though the distributer has other ATM partners such
as Cisco, which recently acquired Stratacom, an ATM technology
specialist.

BIG ISLAND OFFER FREE YO-YO UPGRADE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Following HongKong Telecommunication's recent preview of its new
Caller ID for the territory, Big Island Communications has
announced a free text-to-speed upgrade to Yo Yo, the company's
Caller ID product.

With the upgrade, the product can use Caller ID, not only to put
the name of the caller on the screen, but hear the name spoken, all
before answering the phone.

Yo Yo includes a hardware attachment and software that allows a
user to screen calls, block calls, announce the caller, page the
caller information, and integrate those calls with several of the
leading contact management software programs.

Yo Yo, which was first released in June, and the new version Yo Yo
1.2.1, adds new features such as improved numeric paging, text-to-
speech caller announcement, and expanded call logging.

The new version's Yo Yo Logbook can now print, sort, and save the
duration, date and time for manually dialled calls.

For added ease of use, the Yo YoLand Yo Yo Phonebook now supports
printing and sorting. Yo Yo's Apple event support has been expanded
to allow an Apple Macintosh computer application to send alpha or
numeric pages via AppleEvents.

CORPORATE CHANGES FOR CHINA UNICOM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

China Unicom, the second mobile operator in China is undergoing
some major restructuring in its higher offices. The vice minister
of the Ministry of electronics industry (MEI), Liu Jianfeng, is
expected to take over as chairman replacing Yang Changji.

According to an Unicom spokesperson, the MEI is bound to have a
direct and more strong influence on the operator's activities in
future as opposed to the State Economic and Trade Commission, from
where the former chairman arrived.

One theory put forth by the spokesperson about the move was an
apparent reorganisation of MEI into a commercial corporation, which
is a fallout of the State's intended plans to turn the Ministry of
Electrical Power, Ministry of Metallurgical industry, and the MEI
into commercial entities. However, no confirmed steps have been
taken yet in this direction. The other theory put forth is
centralising Unicom's power in the regional branches.

The earlier interference of shareholders and state governments in
the regional operations will be ended by the headquarters taking
over control of these offices, especially in areas such as finance
and appointments of chiefs.

Currently, Unicom's shareholders comprise government and semi-
government bodies such as the MEI, the Ministry of Electric Power,
the Ministry of Railways, China International Trust and Investment
Corporation with various other companies and city governments. It
also receive international funding from foreign telecom groups.

STRANGE SHIFTS IN HK TELECOM MARKET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY MAHLON CAMPBELL

A recap on growth of wireless telecommunications in the last five
years in Hong Kong has shown many peculiar changes in the market.

Both the cellular and trunk radio market has seen increases of over
300 per cent, the pager market only increased by 1 per cent and CT2
came and went like the wind.

According to Smartone Mobile Communications there has been
extremely strong growth in cellular and this is expected to
continue for the next five years. Pager growth saturated and
declined, while trunk radio continues to be a "niche" and private
network application. And CT2 has been replaced by cellular
upgrades.

Most telecom analysts tend to agree with Smartone's view point of
the wireless telco market, but tread carefully when commenting
about the future. They say the wait-and-see approach has to be
taken.

Analysts say, "with the new PCS license been awarded, it is
interesting to see whether the six service providers can come out
with products and services on time as promised."

"Right now in Hong Kong the cellular penetration is 16 per cent out
of a population of 6 million," said Christopher Lau, controller
services of Smartone. He added this is one of the biggest
penetrations rates in the region.

According to Lau, Smartone forecasts the total mobile subscriber
rate to be 2.5 million by the year 2000.

"We see that 45  per cent of the working population will have a
mobile/wireless communication device," said Lau.

Smartone feels that Hong Kong people view wireless communication as
a important part of their daily life. And the market changes are
driven by competition, technology, regulations, the countries
economy and peoples life style.

Lau said, "to date Smartone has 100,000 subscribers under its belt,
but this figure will grow further as the market changes."

But Smartone's predictions for the next 18 months are optimistic.
They claim that there will be an emphasis on non-voice services and
providers will explore new market segments due to saturation of
usage, competition and user behaviour change.

There will be messaging service developments with extensive use of
IVR/voice messaging together with voice recognition enhancement.

RAD'S KVF.3 TO ENHANCE QUALITY OF KILOMUX 2000

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

RAD introduces a new low bit rate voice module for its Kilomux-2000
called the KVF.3, which claims to maximise bandwidth utilisation
while ensuring quality voice reproduction.

With the KVF.3, the Kilomux-2000 is able to deliver user benefits
like lower per port costs and better performance which is enhanced
by the use of the Multipulse Maximum Likelihood Quantisation
(MPMLQ) voice compression technology.The MPMLQ is claimed to
minimise distortion levels through two compression/decompression
cycles.

The KVF.3 converts the fax analogue signal of incoming fax
transmissions to a digital one. It also supports voice compression
rates of 4.8, 6.4, 7.2 or 9.6 Kbps and several voice/fax calls can
be carried simultaneously over a single 64 Kbps link.

Offering a choice of 2-wire or 4-wire E&M, 2-wire FXO or 2-wire FXS
analogue interfaces, KVF.3 supports connections to PABX trunk and
extension lines, or telephone sets.

GSM MOU PREDICTS HIGH GROWTH FOR ASIAN CELLULAR MARKETS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY JOYITA HALDAR

In its four years of existence, the GSM standard has experienced a
commendable growth with networks operating on the system in 86
countries across the globe.

Furthermore, a 50 per cent penetration is predicted by the year
2000, pointed Gretel Hoffman, chairperson of the GSM MoU
association at its 35th, and the region's first GSM MoU plenary
session, recently held in Hong Kong.

Supporting such indications, industry consultants observe that the
standard will be established in 100 countries by the end of the
decade with over 230 operators installing GSM networks.

Soaring Demand

The session revealed that an estimated four million subscribers
come from Asia, and the cellular market in the region is nowhere
near saturation point as demand for such services across Asia is
soaring, and so is investment in those systems.

Pyramid Research, for instance, estimates that regional spending on
mobile communications networks will almost triple by 2000 to US$10
billion from today's levels.

In many areas across the region, cellular networks are going up
faster than ordinary networks based on land lines, since cellular
networks are much easier to install.

One such example is China, where different cellular technologies
have been and are being trialled, including GSM and CDMA.

Even though capacity is higher than the number of people connected
to any mobile services within the country, John Gilbertson,
Ercisson's managing director for Asia Pacific, is of the opinion
that demand will overtake capacity, and a close to four million
subscribers will be connected by the end of next year.

Such optimism in the mainland's cellular marketplace is reflected
in activities such as the recent buy-out by the German operator,
Deutsche Telekom, taking a 25 per cent stake in a cellular phone
venture, with local partner China International Trust and
Investment Corp. (CITIC), Siemens, and American International
Group, Inc.

The partners are expecting around 600,000 subscribers to connect to
its network by the year 2010. Running on GSM, the network will
cover the cities of Tianjin, Wuhan and QingDao. China Unicom, the
only cellular competitor to the MPT, will operate the GSM networks
which is expected to boost the European technology further in the
country. Currently, China is also trialling the DCS 1800 systems,
as a compliment to its 900 MHz spectrum.

Biggest Market

Kurt Hellstrom, president of Ericsson Radio Systems and a
participant at the session, noted that Asia's growing demand for
cellular services is lucrative enough to make it the swedish
telecom giant's biggest market, quoting that Hong Kong and China
were already its second biggest trading place. Referring to Hong
Kong's new PCS licences, he pointed that networks for such services
would also be GSM-based, only operating at a higher frequency band
than current systems.

These new mobile services roll-out and associated value added
services will only increase penetration level of mobile
communications in the territory from 18 to 40 per cent by the next
millennium, and the role of equipment suppliers will be to keep the
prices low to stimulate demand in mass markets such as Hong Kong.
Five of Hong Kong's six PCS licencees have already opted for the
GSM standard.

However, some major concerns of operators still need attention-one
being billing and collection where their major concern is offering
services to anyone that comes into their markets and recovering the
revenues; the other major point of focus is the assurance of
roaming facilities to as many countries as possible to the
subscribers.

MKTL'S PAGER LICENCE IN JEOPARDY OVER DE-ACTIVATION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Ministry of Communications is planning to initiate actions
against Modi Korea Telecommunications Ltd (MKTL) for its failure to
maintain a database for its pagers, a pre-requisite for the
industry.

It may even withdraw MKTL's licence.

Family problems have led to dissent at the top level within the
Calcutta-based MKTL's holding company, Rossell Industries, whose
sales turnover has dropped steeply in 1995-96 to one-tenth its
level two years earlier [Rs56.7 million (US$1.64 million), against
Rs516.8 million (US$14.99 million) in 1993-94].

On Sep 10, 1996, the Alipore Court had issued an order of
injunction, restraining MKTL from de-activating the services of
nearly 1,000 subscribers.

In utter disregard of the Court's instructions, MKTL disconnected
the services of the subscribers on the night of Sep 11.

The court issued another order on Sep 17, directing the company to
restore all connections.

This has not yet been done. MKTL has admitted that it is not
maintaining a database of pager users, and that it "needed the
pagers physically to ascertain the codification".

However, Appocon Consultants, in a letter to the Ministry of
Communications, has strongly urged the cancellation of MKTL's
licence "in the larger interests of the general public, as they are
not competent enough to provide such services".

INDIAN MINISTER IN CORRUPTION CHARGE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Pandit Sukh Ram, minister for Communications in the ousted Congress
(I) cabinet of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, is in the thick
of a massive corruption scandal that is threatening to turn the
entire telecoms world in India upside-down.

Sleuths of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raided his
houses in New Delhi and Mandi (Himachal Pradesh), and found Rs 36
million (over US$ 1 million) in loose cash and jewellery, lying
about the houses in suitcases and attache-cases.

While all this was happening, Sukh Ram himself happened to be
abroad, having ostensibly gone there for medical treatment.

The minister has since been trying every trick in the book to evade
the sleuths, and avoid coming back to India. The latest was that he
had produced medical certificates to show that, as a heart patient,
he had been advised by his doctors not to travel to India during
September.

Sukh Ram has been unable to account for the money found in his
houses, but Congress is worried that he may  pass them off as funds
collected for the party.

There were several telecom firms that were his favourites, notably
Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd. (HFCL) and Advanced Radio
Masts, whom he favoured with orders after overruling the
recommendations of the Telecom Commission.

Fiat Issued

The new Communications minister, Beni Prasad Verma, has since
issued a fiat to the Department of Telecommunications (DOT),
separating the process of placing purchase orders from the
decision-making on telecom equipment.

He has said that all future orders will be placed by the
appropriate DoT authorities, and not by the minister.

ISDN SERVICES TO COMMENCE SOON IN INDIA

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in India  has upgraded
its existing Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) to commercially
introduce Inte-grated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services.

Prospective users were provided with ISDN connectivity by end-
October 1996.

Worldwide, ISDN has emerged as a powerful tool for integrating
voice, data and image signals.

It may even be used for provisioning voice, data and image services
through an existing telephone network.

"The PSTN has been suitably upgraded through the installation of
ISDN switches to handle computer data transfers at 64 Kbps.

Digital Transmission

"Previously, this was impossible. In addition, the PSTN facilitates
digital fax and image transmission," said MP Modi, chairman,
Telecom Commission.

"The speed of data currently transmitted through the PSTN is
significantly restricted by the design of codes supplied by various
switching system manufacturers," he added.

To date, the PSTN has been solely optimised for human voice
transmission at much lower speeds-ideally at 4,800 bauds per second
(bps), going up to a maximum of 9,600 bps.

As a result, to transmit computer data at high speeds-for example,
at 64,000 bps (that is, at 64 kbps)-a user was compelled to obtain
a leased line from the DoT at a phenomenal cost. Thus, the
installation of a 64 Kbps line for a customer located 5 km away
entailed a minimum initial investment of Rs26,500 (US$750), coupled
with a bi-monthly charge of Rs5,000 (US$141).

Worse, leased lines are prone to frequent failure.

Further, since the line is exclusive, the user seldom has the
option to switch over to a new line.

Officials at the DoT believe that ISDN subscribers will not face
such problems, and that data transmission at 64 Kbps will be
possible at substantially reduced prices.

A prospective ISDN subscriber will only need to procure a special
ISDN handset for Rs300 (US$8.70), an ISDN PC card to obtain 64 Kbps
access, pay the DoT registration fee of Rs3,000 (US$87), and a
Rs1,000 (US$29) monthly rental as basic access rate (BAR).

Simulataneous Calls

Importantly, ISDN subscribers will be able to simultaneously handle
two independent calls on an existing telephone line.

The transmission mode could be speech, data, image or video. The
call set-up time between two ISDN subscribers is also very short,
compared to PSTN.

OPERATORS BANKING ON PHS AS ALTERNATIVE IN THAILAND

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SUTHISAK KRAISRI

THAILAND will finally became the second country in the world to use
the Personal Handyphone System (PHS), a cordless technology created
by Japan.

Two operators are expected to introduce the system, United
Communication Industry (Ucom) and the Shinawatra Group are making
the first move to compete with fixed-line operators who have been
stepping into their mobile market.

According to the Telephone Organisation of Thailand, there is still
room for at least two more private mobile phone operators to invest
in the handyphone service as well.

Shinawatra has been faced with fierce competition, especially from
the in-flux of Internet-related businesses. To stay ahead, the
decision was made to embrace the handy-phone business.

"As Shinawatra Datacom has expertise in networking, it has
capabilities in providing handyphone services as well," said a
Shinawatra executive.

The Ucom Group shares the same idea. But its proposal may be closer
to reality.

Ucom has been shouldering huge losses caused by the freezing of the
CT2 business since three years ago. The company wants to convert
the one-way communication service-called Fonepoint in Thailand-into
a two-way service.

Ucom plans to use Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication
(DECT) technology to make the conversion.

Potential Doubt

Telecom analysts are doubtful of the potential of the PHS, and feel
that Thailand may not take to the technology as the Japanese have
done. Japan expects its number of registers to increase to three
million by year end. A TA senior executive said PHS would become
another choice for those who could not afford mobile phones.

The service is expected to gain wider acceptance in crowded
Bangkok-which offers a big market-but probably not in the
provincial regions.

Though the market potential is questionable, the Thai operators
have no qualms about the technology.

They believe that the investment in PHS is long-term and are hoping
that it will eventually develop into the same level as mobile
phones.

TA has promised to launch its personal handyphone by April next
year while TT&T also plans to introduce its products at about the
same time. The difference is that TT&T has already scaled down its
investment from investing in 20 provinces to around 8 provinces.

FOXCOM'S FIBREOPTIC TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

System 7000 is a low cost L-band (950 MHz-1750 MHz) distribution
system for satellite antenna remoting.

The system is suitable for situations where the highest possible
performance is not required and link distances do not exceed 10 km.
The system is designed to take its RF input from an LNB or
downconverter and directly convert this to 1310 nm light by means
of a Fabrey Perot laser. Transmission is via a 0.4 dB/km loss
single mode optical fibre.

System 7200 is the highend version and is intended for applications
such as Intelsat earth station antenna remoting, INMARSAT
transmit/receive, telecommunication interfacility links, and CATV
downlinks, where higher dynamic range is required.

The 7200 produces a better quality and higher power signal than the
7000 version by means of a DFB laser with low noise figure.
Effective transmission range is over 20 km.

The company's IF fibre optic transmission products include the 70
MHz or 140 MHz System 7070 (for links up to 5 km) and the higher
specification 7070D for links exceeding 20 km. The 7070D version
can operate in a multi-channel environment The 7070 series is
designed for broadcast up- and downlinks, teleports, and
interfacility communications for government and the military.

All of Foxcom's transmission products include an integrated
features set. Their plug-and-play capabilities incorporate
automatic gain control (AGC) that maintains optimum operation over
a wide range of signal levels and channel lineups and that enables
the end-user to set up the equipment easily.

All products also include (as an option) the 7050 bi-direction data
modem unit which provides an RS232 over single mode fibre link
between stations. The purpose of the 7050 is to monitor microcell
or antenna status and therefore can serve as part of a fibre break
diagnostic system.

INDIA's Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is facing tough
times.

This was made clear in mid-September when the DoT placed orders
with Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL) and Optel-two companies it had
earlier accused of being involved in a cartel.

In accusing the two companies, communications minister, Beni Prasad
Verma, had said: "We will take a serious  view of any cartelisation
that takes place. We will write strongly to the directors of these
companies against their involvement in the formation of cartels,
and ensure that we don't deal with these companies in future.

"In case companies get into a cartel again, we may be forced to
float a global tender."

But in mid-September, the DoT went ahead and placed orders with the
same companies-a proceeding that has caused waves of confusion to
wash through the industry.

"Since these two companies have been given the orders, it only
follows that they have gained from the cartelisation," said a
disgruntled competitor who had also hoped to get the order.

The tender had been floated on Mar 22 for the procurement of 21,000
km of fibre optic cable.

This included 9,000 km of six-fibre optical fibre cable, 10,500 km
of 12-fibre cable and 1,500 km of 24-fibre cable.

Sixteen bidders had taken part in the tender. They included
Sterlite Industries, Vikas Hybrid, Gujarat Optical, Birla Ericsson,
Aksh India, Optel, HCL, Plasmac and Bhilai Wires, Surana Telecom,
Sudarshan Telecom, Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited
(HFCL), Uniflex Cables, RPG Telecom and Plasman Telecom.

Cartel

When the bids were opened on May 21, it was found that all bidders,
barring Sudarshan Telecom, had engaged in the cartel.

They had quoted a price which was 16 per cent higher than the price
at which they had supplied orders the last time round.

All the prices were in a narrow range, which indicated that the
telecom companies had probably met and decided upon the quotations
they would make.

Sudarshan's quotations were substantially lower than that of the
other 15 bidders .

It had quoted Rs717.2 million for the supply of 9,000 km of the
six-fibre cable, while the other bidders' quotes ranged from
Rs961.9 million to Rs970.9 million.

Scandal

This is not the only scandal to rock India's telecommunications
industry.

In 1995, the former communications minister, Pandit Sukh Ram , had
scrapped the tender and placed orders with companies he favoured.

Sukh Ram is currently in Tihar Jail for having assets
disproportionate to his known sources of income.

Meanwhile, the DoT has been finding it difficult to get the holders
of the Letters of Intent (LoIs) issued by it for six basic telecom
circles, to sign the licence and interconnect agreements.

RPG Telecom, Tata Telecom, Hughes Ispat, Usha India, Essar Telecom
and Reliance-Nynex have all raised issues such as port charges,
billing disputes and arbitration, in separate letters to the DoT.

No Re-negotiation

"We are not re-negotiating the tender," explained a spokesperson of
Essar Telecom. "We want the scrapping of the clauses that were
added later to the tender, and which would make the projects
financially unviable.

"The inclusion of port charges, for example, is downright
unreasonable."

The LoI holders have also demanded that the roles of the DoT, the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the licensor be
clearly defined.

Said the Essar official: "All regulatory matters, such as the
review of the licensee's technology, quality of service standards,
and termination, revocation or suspension of licence, should be the
sole responsibility of the TRAI.

Arbitration

"Arbitration should be undertaken by an independent panel chosen by
an agreement between parties or undertaken by the TRAI when it is
established."

One of the major problems that the DoT is facing is that it is
sorely under-staffed.

Many managerial positions are vacant and there have been no
government sanctions to recruit new people.

The DoT is also plagued by the fact that all the telecom players
insist on having their say whenever any modification is made to any
agreement.

They are adamant that modifications should not be at the sole
discretion of the telecom authority, but by mutual agreement.

Clearly, considering the DoT's constant changes of stance in the
past, the operators are being extra cautious.

TWO-WAY PAGING SOLUTION FROM NEXUS FOR ASIA-PACIFIC

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY LAWRENCE NORMIE

Nexus Telecommunications Systems was founded in 1991 to develop and
manufacture portable wireless communication and location products
for two-way paging, automatic vehicle identification, and
industrial monitoring telemetry.

Nexus has developed a  wide area communication and location network
technology that combines the cost-efficiency of one-way paging
technology with the huge market potential of portable two-way
communication and location systems.

System Overlay

The Nexus approach is particularly attractive because its product
overlays existing paging system infrastructures, consequently
implementation and operation costs are significantly reduced.

The Nexus two-way communications and location system exploits a
one-way paging infrastructure for the out-bound communications link
(from the network to the subscriber devices) and proprietary
digital  spread spectrum technology for the in-bound communications
link (from the subscriber to the network).

The frequency hopping spread spectrum technique is effective in
combating interference due to spectral congestion, multipath
propagation and jamming as well as providing communications
security. The network complies with US FCC standard Part 15 and
operates in the band between 800 MHz and 1 GHz.

The network uses interferometric techniques to determine the
location of a unit in the field.

Transmissions from the unit are received by at least two base
stations, each equipped with an array antenna to determine the
direction of arrival from the point of transmission.

The arrival angle is calculated at each base station and the result
transmitted to the command and control center, where the location
of the transmission is calculated and displayed on an electronic
map together with identification information.

Nexus has been active in the Asia-Pacific market for two years. The
Nexus "NexNet" two-way paging  and location network became
operational in Sydney, Australia this September, following the Nov
1995 signing of an agreement with INC Communication, an Australian
company engaged in data communications, manufacturing, and
services.

Wide Growth

"The roll-out of the Nexus system and technology is the direct
result of the wide growth of the paging market in Asia Pacific and
the popular demand for value-added services" said marketing manager
Adi Pundak-Mintz.

Shlomi Tenenberg (VP Sales) said that the company's 1997 objectives
include expansion into paging markets other than Australia.

The company also is seeking additional partners for deploying its
systems in local markets in Asia-Pacific.

Nexus technology already is being used under license in India and
two-way paging and end-units are manufactured for Nexus by Samsung
Electronics Corporation  (Korea) under a nonexclusive licensing
agreement.

According to Pundak-Mintz, specific product definition and
marketing  issues that relate specifically to Asia-Pacific include
high volume usage, the requirement for special character sets in
end-devices, and the high sophistication of technologically-
adaptive customers.

ISRAEL-THE LAND OF HIGH TECH OPPORTUNITIES

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY PETER TSUKAHIRA

High-tech business culture is being transformed as the rate of
worldwide technological change steadily increases.

This is evident in fields none other than high-speed, local area
and wide area telecommunications.

The personal computer revolution has placed even greater computing
power on the desktop in offices and homes around the world.

With the explosive growth of electronic mail services and the
Internet's World Wide Web, more and more people are using their
personal computers as networking end-stations than ever before.
This surge of technological change, coupled with greater freedom of
access to networked information, is forcing the creation of new
types of corporate structures.

Older, hierarchical corporate structures with fixed chain-of-
command reporting and clearly defined functional "borders" are
unable to respond quickly enough to exploit developing market
opportunities.

Today's high-tech markets consist of multi-national, multi-cultural
organisations where even small and medium-sized manufacturers are
players in the global environment.

De-centralised corporate structures, based on personal
relationships and shared goals rather than rigid organisational
lines, are required to survive and thrive in this internationally
competitive environment.

Cultural Mosaic

Israel's society is young in the sense that the modern nation is
not yet even 50 years old. Israel is a cultural mosaic of
immigrants from literally every corner of the globe. Everyone, it
seems, has a different cultural background and this has resulted in
a society where boundaries tend to be relatively undefined and
where extreme informality is considered normal.

Israel is a small and militarily vulnerable country. Israeli army
officers are taught to view advance planning as necessary, but only
as a basis for making required changes. That is to say, they are
taught to quickly adapt to changing conditions, to improvise and to
have a positive attitude towards taking calculated risks.

Despite having invented one of the world's first minicomputers in
the early 1970's, the Israeli computer industry has not been a
force to be reckoned with until quite recently.

Israel's high-tech industry has grown rapidly and in the present
era of networked computing, this small nation fields a number of
high-tech developers and network device manufacturers
disproportionate to its size.

Representatives from key industry publications confide that Israel
has joined the greater Boston area and Silicon Valley as a major
geographical source of advertising dollars.

The reasons for Israel's new-found prominence in this field is
multifarious. It has to do with the youth and vitality of modern
Israel, a highly educated workforce and the motivation of the
talent available.

The Israeli high-tech industry excels at producing practical,
robust and relatively simple solutions for complex problems.
Perhaps this is the result of the kind of military training that
every young man experiences as part of his upbringing.

Quality performance in small groups and quick decision-making by
junior officers are Israeli traits developed in the army. These
abilities will serve Israel well in the fiercely competitive
international high-tech marketplace.

The computer networking world is still relatively new and growing
rapidly. Small groups of highly motivated engineers working in non-
structured environments can still create the next industry's "hot
box" or best seller product. Because time-to-market is crucial to
the success of a new product, quick decision making and on-the-fly
implementation are highly valued.

These Israeli capabilities have not gone unnoticed in the global
search for high-technology talent. Huge multi-national companies
have begun acquiring  smaller Israeli high-tech communications
companies.

In recent years, NiceCom, a Tel Aviv-based ATM developer was
acquired by 3Com; Scorpio Communications by US Robotics;
intelligent hub maker, LanNet was acquired by Madge of the UK and
LAN switch start-up, Ornet was bought by Siemens.

I believe the Asia Pacific societies place a high value on virtues
like patience, self-discipline and social cohesion. This is
reflected in the attitudes and behaviour of the workforce and Asian
"corporate culture."

These strengths lend themselves to precision manufacturing and high
quality, low cost mass production. It seems that as soon as a given
technology stabilises, companies in Asia Pacific add refinements
and then seize market leadership.

This is apparent in the worldwide market for computer memory chips.
This technology was pioneered in the US and Europe but now is
dominated almost entirely by Asian companies.

In spite of Asia Pacific dominance in a wide range of industries
from musical instruments and automobiles to optics and electronic
equipment of all kinds, one vital technology has proven most
difficult to master. This is the area of microprocessor design.
While Asia is the champion of computer memories, the US has
maintained a commanding lead in microprocessors.

The major US chip manufacturers (Intel, Motorola, National
Semiconductor) each have large facilities in Israel where
microprocessors and other devices like digital signal processors
are designed and built.

The Intel Corporation recently completed planning for the next
generation Pentium processor, the first to be developed entirely in
Israel. Intel also announced plans for an additional US$1.6 billion
dollar facility in Israel for flash memory fabrication.

An interesting but little known fact is that Silicon Valley in
California, a place where new technologies abound, is home to many
expatriate Israelis. When some high-tech companies in Israel
recruit, they will often place ads in local San Jose newspapers
hoping to catch experienced returnees.

As more Asian companies enter the global high-tech marketplace,
contact with Israeli technology developers will grow.

Partnerships

Collaboration between Israeli and Asian communications companies
have the potential to be extremely innovative and fruitful.

There are already some notable partnerships existing today
producing very positive results. Asian companies doing business
with Israel stand to gain not only technology but ideas. Israel's
close geographic and cultural proximity to Europe means access to
European market channels for Asian-Israeli business tie-ups.

Israeli high-tech products are to be found in operation on
customers' premises throughout Asia-Pacific. Direct investment in
Israel by South-east Asian multi-national companies is growing.
Increasingly, in today's global marketplace, the Far East will be
meeting the Middle East in high technology.

ADVANCING THE STATE OF THE SUBSCRIBER LOOP

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

FOR many new telephone users in fast-growth telecom regions such as
China, Korea and India, their initial experiences have been with
traditional phone services over ordinary twisted-pair copper
wiring.

However, major telecom providers in China and other countries are
now installing sophisticated high-speed, high-bandwidth, all-
digital backbone infrastructures.

But for most users, primary telephone services will, for now, be
based on this traditional, POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)
model.

In POTS, the speaker's voice is carried over analogue circuits
which originate at the telephone's microphone. The signal is
delivered to a subscriber-loop switch. There, the voice waves are
converted into digital information then sent via high-speed lines
to the subscriber-loop switch of the receiving party.

But even within POTS, significant advancements are underway,
particularly in the key analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
conversion components, ie. the codecs.

For instance, thanks to semiconductor integration, codecs and their
related filtering functions-which used to require multiple chips-
were combined into single, integrated chips in the early 1980s.

The resulting devices contributed substantially to the worldwide
proliferation of digital telephone switches.

Now and in the future, newer DSP (digital signal processing)
technologies and smaller semiconductor process technologies are
enabling designers to build codecs with multi-channel
architectures.

Today, each telephone number requires a unique codec in the
subscriber loop switch. Multi-channel codecs will be able to handle
several independent subscriber telephone conversations
simultaneously.

Eventually, as many as 32 channels may be integrated in a single
piece of silicon.

The savings in space and cost will be significant.

And those savings will help further boost residential and business
telephone installations in countries such as China, where
expectations currently run as high as 20 million new line
installations per year.

Fibre to the Curb

Another advance involves the continual distribution of telecom
functions-and of "fat-pipe" digital bandwidth-closer to homes.

To do that, telecom providers are now able to place a multiplexer,
called a digital loop carrier (DLC-also known as a remote access
unit), between the subscriber-loop switch and the home.

The DLC helps to extend the geographical area served, and it
extends high-speed digital bandwidth for video and similar
applications closer to the user.

This type of distribution permits bringing "fibre to the curb," or
at least to the DLC.

Although copper twisted pair and coaxial cable are digital-capable,
fibre is preferred both for reasons of economy and because it
permits greatly extended service provisioning.

Another critical subscriber loop function is the subscriber line
card, or SLIC.

The SLIC co-exists with the codec at the subscriber loop switch or
the DLC. Its role is to perform certain supervisory functions, and
to balance the subscriber loop in order to produce an optimal
signal.

Subscriber loops vary in length and signal characteristics from
country to country and even among local services.

In response, the newest trend in SLIC technology involves software-
programmable balance features.

These permit providers to make on-site adjustments to meet various
specifications without requiring circuitry modifications. The
result: remotely-controlled automation, and more easily distributed
functionality.

Digital to the Door

In addition to "fibre to the curb", ISDN (Integrated Services
Digital Network) is fast gaining notoriety as a major performance
enhancer for Internet communications.

At up to 160 Kbps bandwidth, it can make Internet graphics seem to
jump onto the screen-a vivid contrast to the less nimble
performance of today's typical 14.4 and 28.8 Kbps modems.

Beyond its Internet performance, the advent of residential ISDN
represents a milestone in the evolution of the subscriber loop.

By simply adding ISDN transceivers at each end of the subscriber
loop, operators can make use of the same copper twisted pair wiring
now employed for low-speed analog services to deliver high-speed,
all-digital information right to the user's own computer.

All that is needed today, for people in many parts of the world, is
an ISDN adapter card or external modem, and an added service from
the telecom provider.

And for users in countries with newly-developing telecom
infrastructures, ISDN may be closer than it seems.

Today, the services may be analog POTS, but the backbone and
subscriber loop switches in developing countries such as China,
Korea, India, and Taiwan are ISDN-capable-good news for future ISDN
users in those regions.

Also good news is the fact that, as with other technologies, future
generations of ISDN transceivers are destined to become
increasingly smaller and more economical.

As with the codec, newer ISDN implementations will make use of
multichannel architectures. As many as eight individual
transceivers may be integrated into a single silicon chip at the
telecom provider's subscriber loop switch, and this will help to
drive down costs, and drive up availability.

Semiconductor integration will benefit users in other ways.

Future ISDN internal adapter cards (or external modems) will
feature increasing levels of integration.

Today, those units contain numerous discrete support devices-for
translating data formats between the internal PC bus and the ISDN
transceiver, for instance, or for the codec functions still
necessary to support a second, standard telephone or fax service as
a peripheral to the PC.

In the future, they will be integrated with the microcontrollers,
memory and other components that populate adapter cards into a
true, single-chip adapter card system.

Video in the Loop

What's next? Full motion video, for one thing, over standard
twisted-pair copper wiring, thanks to the "XDSL" (or X Digital
Subscriber Line) technologies: Asymmetric (ADSL), Hybrid (HDSL),
and Very-high-speed (VDSL).

In reality, a second pair of copper wires will have to be added to
the subscriber loop in order to do the job. But the result will be
well    worth the small additional infrastructure expense.

For instance, ADSL has been tested at a download rate of more than
6 Mbps, and an upload rate of 640 Kbps-faster than ISDN, and far
beyond today's common modem speeds.

Moreover, ADSL is closer than many realise, as well.

Numerous lower-speed ADSL products are already on the market.

With ADSL-and with the advances in compression made possible by
sophisticated DSP semiconductor technologies-telecom providers will
finally be able to offer high-quality movie transmissions to
residential users.

Subsequently, the subscriber loop will be enhanced again by the
addition of HDSL as a user choice.

HDSL may not offer as high a download bandwidth as ADSL, which
continues to improve as development progresses, but it will bring
symmetrical capabilities to twisted pair transmissions. This will
open the door to the possibilities of interactive movies and games,
potentially a vast market.

Along with ADSL and HDSL, will come VDSL. It may require adding a
second twisted pair to the telephone line.

Most homes already have "twisted quad" or better wiring in place,
even though they do not use it.

In new installations, savvy telecom providers are likely to use
multiple pairs in order to be prepared for the future. VDSL will
reward its implementers with a download bandwidth that could reach
52 Mbps, and upload bandwidth as high as 6 Mbps.

Bandwidth Knocking

Importantly, these and other advances in subscriber-loop
capabilities will make possible exponential increases in home-
delivered bandwidth-all over traditional twisted-pair copper
wiring.

By putting in place the infrastructure basics today-the high-speed
wide-area digital backbones, and the digital-ready subscriber-loop
switches-the world's telecom providers are preparing the way for
relatively easy upgrades to higher-bandwidth technologies, and to
added user services.

At the same time, these advances will not necessarily limit users
to a single, copper-wire transmission medium. Various cable-
oriented providers are pushing hard to gain a share of the high-
bandwidth residential/small office market via fibre-optic or hybrid
fibre/coaxial technologies.

Advances in twisted-pair technologies will prove beneficial to the
traditional telecom providers, as will their experience with
communications interactivity.

As for the cable companies, they already have the high bandwidth;
what they need is an interactive, economical "subscriber-loop"
infrastructure-just like the telecom providers.

In all probability, the users will benefit from having choices in
both technologies.

Today's analogue POTS user can migrate forward as twisted pair
bandwidth grows, and can elect to grow with POTS-or move to cable-
at points along the way that are convenient for the user, and not
dictated by industry vendors.

TELECOMMUNICATION SWITCH MANUFACTURERS STILL RULES

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

While the computer manufacturers are gaining ground in
telecommunications networks under IN's advances, there should be no
mistake: the telecommunications switch manufacturer is still king.
This is because the manufacturers can use IN functions as a lever
in the sale of central office switches, and offer an entire package
that is guaranteed to work flawlessly.

Perwira Ericsson's AXE switches, currently delivered to Telekom
Malaysia, include IN functions, as did Lucent's  shipments of 5ESS
switches to Philippines' Globe Telecom. Ericsson will add AXE
switches/SDH transmission equipment to those shipped to the
Guangdong PTA by Lucent.

Telecom equipment manufacturers also win IN contracts outside of
direct switch sales. Ericsson has implemented a universal personal
telecommunications platform in Australia; and Guangdong-Nortel will
supply the Beijing Telecommunications Administration (BTA) with IN
features that build on the CCS7 network supplied previously to the
BTA.

Switch manufacturers are collaborating with computing manufacturers
too. Parts of Hewlett-Packard's (HP) OpenCall platform were used in
Nortel's ServiceBuilder architecture, and Lucent is working with HP
to jointly develop IN functions.

Switch manufacturers are also continuing to develop IN on their
own. This year, Lucent showed Advantage, an IN platform for
creation, customisation, and delivery environment of IN services
such as voice/fax mailboxes, voice activated dialling and one
number services for mixed media. Advantage serves as both SCP and
IP (see main story on page 10 for definitins) for wire line and
wireless networks; its capabilities extend from the PSTN to data
and multimedia networks.

Intelligent Gain

Siemens introduced the concept of using intelligent agents with IN
through its global advanced intelligent network (GAIN) platform.
The idea was demonstrated with a calendar manager application that
automatically arranged appointments in an electronic diary. Those
messages could also be read over the telephone.

Tandem Computers' NonStop operating kernel, and Himalaya and
Integrity IN middleware are joined by the S4000 Unix standard
servers. The company's platforms have been installed for call
processing, operations support systems and decision support.

Vying to increase its role in telecommunications, HP's  strategy
plans to serve as the hardware, operating platform and applications
middleware.

HP's OpenCall platform, released in September last year, is a bid
to do much of the same for IN. In addition to its relationships
with Nortel and Lucent, Fujitsu, Ericsson, and Nokia are some
companies offering OpenCall support.

IBM's Multiple Services Platform/6000 (MSP/6000) for business and
residential IN applications, uses the company's RISC System /6000
operating under AIX. MSP/6000 can operate as both SCP and/or IP in
the network, and is bundled with software handling voice, fax, and
data IN. MSP/6000 uses CallPath DirectTalk/6000 as a voice
peripheral for voice messages, interactive voice response, and
audiotex. Data processing adds functions such as messaging and
gateways for e-mail, and access to on-line services.

Call management provides the SSP function and manages user and
service access to the MSP/6000 node. Messaging support adds line-
based paging notification and applications interfaces to other
messaging systems.

System Integrators

Bellcore, formerly the communications research facility of the US
telcos, is one of the world's most influential AIN consulting and
engineering service companies. While Bellcore will work within the
operator's requirements, it also has its own IN/AIN service control
point system (ISCP) software. ISCP consists of SPACE (service
creation and positioning software), DRS (data and reports system,
for custom data collection and reporting), and a data distributor.

For the IP component, Bellcore has its intelligent services
peripheral, which allows voice or keyboard directions to access
complex IN functions.

The Sema Group is a major systems integrator with a global reach as
well. A large part of the company's focus is in wireless systems,
though its value added services manager (VAS Manager) provides an
IN core around which wireless and wire line services can be built.
The VAS Manager uses interactive voice response, and integrates
voice and text messaging, as well as supports wire line call
routing and wireless roaming.

The integrator has worked together with Alcatel to supply wireless
components to Indonesia's Satelindo as well.

Unisys, a hardware supplier and systems integrator, offers its A-
Series OpenFrame computers with its Network Applications Platform
(NAP) software.

For IN, NAP's VoiceSource application provides interactive voice
response. VoiceSource has been used for automated attendant,
automatic collect calling, enhanced emergency services and audio
calling directories. It has also been used for networking (such as
X.400), fax response, paging, and voice messaging services.

TINA-THE NEXT MILLENNIUM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture (TINA)
standard proposes two actions: to merge AIN (Advance Intelligent
Networks) and telecommunications network management with the
computer industry's object-oriented software and client-server
distributed computing concepts; while removing these functions from
their link to the underlying transport network.

The management aspect of TINA is handled according to the
Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) specifications.

TINA is based on an "open" computing architecture, incorporating
the Object Management Group's (OMG) common object request broker
architecture (CORBA).

CORBA is used to allow software "objects" and applications to work
together, independent of the underlying hardware and programming
language used. TINA's object definition language, for example, is a
superset of OMG's CORBA interface design language, using additional
concepts for grouping, stream interfaces and service attributes to
support real-time traffic in large networks.

Part of TINA's charter is to fill the role as the service and
management platform for ATM and multimedia broadband services. This
means managing and providing Internet services and telecom
infrastructure. TINA is meant to integrate completely into existing
wire line and wireless IN infrastructures, and is being designed to
co-exist and cooperate with all existing IN services.

Service creation in TINA will be a matter of picking and choosing
from a software object library of re-useable service components, to
which new components can be defined and added continuously.

TINA Consortium

The TINA Consortium (TINA-C) was founded in 1993 and consists of
engineers from 40 telecoms and IT companies around the world (see
Table 1). With its HQ at Bellcore's facilities in the US, TINA-C
has a five-year charter to define and validate a software
architecture that will allow communications services to be
introduced efficiently where computing, entertainment and
telecommunication industries are merging.

This year, TINA-C will evaluate, validate, and refine
specifications whose completed architecture is expected to be
presented by the end of 1997.

The TINA concept consists of several architectures; distributed
computing, service, network and management.

The computing architecture describes how software objects should be
'plugged' into the distributed processing environment. The service
architecture defines how services are provisioned, accessed, and
used. The network defines how the network resources are ordered and
used to establish end to end connections. The management
architecture gives specifications for configuring, accounting,
performance, and security.

Unlike IN, which is applied separately to each call, TINA defines
sessions which can be any number of activities to achieve a
purpose. There are several types of sessions under the service
architecture, eg. an Access Session defines the entrance into TINA
services, allowing the user to access, make requests, and retrieve
information.

Where UPT (universal personal telecommunication) exists today as a
basic form of mobility, TINA defines three different types of
mobility for future universal mobile telecommunications systems
(UMTS): Personal mobility allows a subscriber to use services
independent of their network point of attachment and specific
equipment. This feature is offered by some PABXs, which allow an
employee to sit down at any handset, punch an identifying code, and
have access to all their personal, customised features.

Terminal mobility makes use of terminals independent of the point
of attachment to the network, and exists today in the form of UPT.

Session mobility, which allows service sessions to 'follow' the
participant. This means that a subscriber could suspend a session
and resume it from a different terminal at a later time. This
allows the subscriber to request information and have it ready the
next time the service is accessed.

Figure 2 gives an example of TINA-C operating for service delivery
to users through a telecoms network. The user domain represents the
user and their terminal equipment The content domain represents
those that produce or licence content for wholesale use, such as
the film industry or multimedia information providers.

The network domain is the network operator, eg. PTT, which provides
the underlying connections to deliver the content. The retailer
domain is the brokers of information services who present and
'sell' the available information services to the consumer.

SWITCHING AWAY TO CLIENT-SERVER NETWORKS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BRIAN WASHBURN

THE Intelligent Network (IN), first thought up in the 1960s, has
gradually migrated from the telecommunications equipment
manufacturers field into the realm of computing.

In the early years, the intelligence resided in the switch. Each
switch needed a "service logic", instructing it how to process and
direct calls. This meant that with any new service introduced, the
software in each switch had to be upgraded.

As switch software became more complex, new IN features also became
riskier. In telecommunications where there was little room for
software bugs, IN services developed by telecoms switch
manufacturers often were not compatible.

A simple solution was to take the service logic away from the
switch, and place it in a central computer, which would serve the
network. The switches would thus only hold the interfaces that send
and receive information with this central computer. This developed
into the modern concept of IN.

Today, the IN market is inhabited by a mix of computing, software
and telcos. Together with telecommunications network management, it
appears that the computer manufacturers are gradually making in-
roads on a hardware basis and looking towards inheriting the rest
of the field as well.

Freephone (toll free) and premium rate services were some of the
first IN features developed using off-switch computing.

More advanced IN features  today include universal personal
telecommunications (UPT), or one number services, and virtual
private networks (VPNs). UPT introduces the concept of the mobile
terminal, routing calls by various schemes to the subscribers,
regardless of whether they are at home, at work, or travelling with
a mobile handset.

VPNs allow Centrex services to be available over the wide area
instead of on a switch by switch basis, allowing four digit
internal dialling and other features such as call hold, call
forward, and three way conferencing through the public network.

To denote the difference between the simpler IN services
(freephone) and those advanced services, the term Advanced
Intelligent Network (AIN) came into use.

AIN describes IN that gives greater control to the computer, and is
less reliant on the central office switches.

In March 1992, the ITU defined Intelligent Network Capability Set 1
(IN CS-1), which set a global standard frame work for constructing
advanced IN services and interfaces. Last year, the ITU-T completed
enhancements to CS-1. Defining additional IN capability sets (CS-2,
CS-3) under Study Group 11/Working Party 4 of the ITU-T is
progressing well, and the work is published under the Q.12XX series
of recommendations.

Components in today's IN architecture are: the service switching
point (SSP), service control point (SCP), service creation
environment (SCE), service data point (SDP), service management
system (SMS), and intelligent peripheral (IP) (see Figure 1).

The SSP is an element installed at the local exchange. When a call
requests an IN service, eg. by dialling a calling code that
accesses a freephone service, the SSP sends the request over the
signalling network to the service control point, which uses the
common channel signalling system 7 (CCS7) or other signalling
protocol. It then awaits instructions on how to handle the call.

The SCP is the "intelligence" behind the IN. It receives requests
sent by the SSPs, processes and sends a reply such as call routing
instructions back to the SSP. It does not matter how many SCPs are
in the network, or where each is located, as long as each switch
has an SCP it can access.

The SDP is another name for a database which connects and supplies
the SCP with data. Some IN services need to store a great deal of
data, eg. UPT system contains several cross-referenced phone
numbers for hundreds of thousands of customers.

The IP provides custom resources for interaction between a user and
the IN. Presently, this is voice processing coupled with services
such as speech and number recognition for wire line or wireless
networks.

The SCE and SMS are not part of the actual active services under
the IN make-up. Rather, the SCE is a design and modelling
environment to develop and test new services before loading them
onto the SCPs. The SMS handles central network management for the
SCPs, and is used to introduce and distribute new software
throughout the network.

IN, however, is not only a matter of adding intelligence to the
public network, its challenges reach far beyond the IN components
themselves.

Billing is one issue that needs to be resolved. Fortunately, IN
billing is somewhat similar to toll-operator billing. In networks
where operator assistance, call collect, and third party billing
are incorporated into the billing infrastructure and eventually
find their way onto the subscriber's invoice, adding IN support is
another step in the same direction.

IN requires capturing information and adding the charges to
subscriber invoices. Many current billing systems are inflexible
and must be modified to accommodate the more complex IN, especially
when services like usage-based IN service metering are introduced.
Additionally, the IN equipment needs some sort of accountability to
generate reports.

Things become even more complex when multiple network services are
involved. UPT that incorporates cellular, wire line, paging, and
other types of terminal devices operated by different PTT branches
or operators can create a billing nightmare.

The technical counterpart to the headache is in tying existing
voice and fax messaging, interactive voice response, and other
network elements into the IN.

But perhaps the most difficult issue is that IN obstacles do not
end on technical matters: Which branch is responsible for the IN
functions and the customer? How does the PTT determine the revenue
split from services that span across another operating unit's
resources, and across different networks? These concerns are joined
by regulatory issues-where a PTT's operations may not be authorised
to operate "bundled" wire line, cellular, and paging services.

Another area of potential trouble, but one of great potential
benefit as well, is in testing how new IN features may interact
with existing IN.

For example, combining UPT with VPN service to allow business
professionals to dial in to a home office from anywhere may be a
very valuable feature for some businesses. This sort of service
would allow an employee to call the company's freephone number,
give a security identification, enter their present telephone
number and forward all business calls to their location.

NEW GIGASWITCH/IP: SIMPLE, COST EFFECTIVE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY GRAEME K. LE ROUX

EARLIER this year we looked at the state of play with ATM.

We suggested that, while the ATM standards set was coming along
nicely, deploying a real ATM network was still fraught with more
than a few problems.

While much work has been done since then, ATM is still something
the average network manager is best advised to treat as a spectator
sport if at all possible; but the game is getting more interesting.

Practical Advance

Perhaps the most practical advance in ATM has been recently
introduced by US-based Ipsilon in partnership with Digital in the
form of ATM-based IP Switching technology.

This is probably the first generally useful application of ATM.

It is, perhaps, more than a little ironic that IP Switching as
exhibited by the Digital GigaSwitch/IP is in effect, a method of
turning an ATM network into a single logical IP router.

Remember the hype about ATM marking the beginning of the end of the
router?

Ipsilon's technology differs significantly from other ATM-based
routing solutions which have been less than impressive.

The ATM-based router "solutions" which have been released by
several vendors, have simply been various methods of connecting one
or more "fat pipes" to a traditional router.

Ordinary IP traffic is broken into cells, transmitted with varying
degrees of reliability across an ATM network, and  reassembled into
the original IP packets.

This should not be confused with the process of de-fragmentation
which IP routers do not perform.

The reassembled cells are then routed in the traditional manner
using information propagated with ordinary routing protocols such
as RIP or OSPF.

Build a network of, say, five routers using this type of technology
and all you are doing is substituting ATM interfaces-one per
router-and an ATM switch for ordinary high speed serial interfaces-
four per router.

Such a network behaves in exactly the same way whether you use
serial interfaces or ATM, provided you do not flood the ATM switch
in which case cells are dropped.

There is no solid data on what happens if you do flood the ATM
switch in a situation like this because nobody has tried it yet in
the real world.

It is possible that your expensive ATM switch might turn into a
random fault generator and the five routers (or the end stations
connected to them), would then spend a lot of time reconfiguring
themselves around the "faulty" links through the ATM network and
trying to retransmit data.

On the other hand, the routers might throttle back transmitting
stations via normal IP mechanisms.

This would leave the ATM switch with the inter-router traffic
generated by the routing protocol in use-that is a much smaller
load.

In this case, it would recover, enabling it to provide reliable
links once more and, in turn, permitting the routing algorithms to
converge.

Which of these scenarios actually occurs would depend upon the
equipment in use, the nature of the IP traffic between the routers,
the performance of the IP's flow control mechanisms, the
intelligence of the router's ATM interfaces, and so forth.

Would the network recover or not?

Flip a coin or better yet buy the network described above, try it
and send us an e-mail; we'd love to know.

Avoids Problems

Ipsilon and Digital's approach avoids the potential problems in the
scenario described above in two ways.

First, Digital's Gigaswitches are designed such that no possible
combination of ports can exceed the back plane bandwidth of the
switch which, when combined with their non-blocking ATM flow
control algorithms, all but eliminates dropped cells.

Second, Ipsilon treats the whole ATM network as a single router
which extends, in the example outlined above, to five separate
locations and not a network of discrete routers.

As a result there are no convergence issues-OSPF, RIP, and so forth
are intended to work between routers, not within them.

If you were to interconnect five GigaSwitch/IP-based networks
(let's say, five large university campuses) via 10 links (standard
DDN links, for example), you would have precisely the same
convergence issues which you have right now -ATM would not come
into it.

Target Market

The GigaSwitch/IP is aimed at Internet Service Providers or large
campus sites.

It is significantly cheaper than any comparable solution based on
standard routers.

All this is made possible by the remarkably simple-at least in
concept-idea of looking at the nature of an incoming IP packet.

If an incoming IP packet is something short,  let's say a DNS look
up, then a routing decision is made and an SVC is set up within the
ATM network by the Ipsilon software.

The packet is broken up into ATM cells, transmitted via the SVC,
the SVC is torn down, the packet reassembled and transmitted out of
the destination port of the "router". This is a slow process. The
SVC set up and tear down is, however, not significant and neither
is the process of packet disassembly and re-assembly.

It is the routing decision which takes the time-this is what
prohibits the average "ATM-capable" router from working much faster
than the same device connected to a serial interface.

The interesting part is that only about 10 per cent of IP packets
fit this category of a "short" transmission.

Ninety per cent of IP traffic is a stream of several packets such
as a file transfer, Web page hit, and so forth. For this sort of
traffic, there is no point in setting up and then tearing down
SVCs.

This means that after the first packet is processed, you have a
virtual point-to-point link within the ATM network which is, in
this case, the router.

If you have a point-to-point link between the source and
destination ports in your router, you do not need to make a routing
decision on the rest of the packets in the stream. This means that
you can bypass the router's decision making engine.

The result is an improvement in throughput of several hundred
percent at little, if any, extra cost.

A six-slot GigaSwitch/IP costs less than US$60,000 and has a
maximum throughput of 5.3 million packets per second. This makes it
better than five times that of an average high-end router, which is
likely to cost almost double the price.

Another practical application for ATM which has developed nicely
over the last year or so is the use of ATM as a backbone within a
campus environment.

Using ATM as a campus backbone boils down to using it to
interconnect hubs within discrete areas, usually of departmental
size (say 250 plus users), of a campus. In this mode, ATM can
integrate data, voice and video services, but only for very large
sites due to the cost of the necessary high-end equipment.

Such equipment is still only available from vendors like Nortel-
although some traditional IT vendors such as IBM, which with the
high end of their Nways product line, are making inroads into this
market. As a data only solution based on PVCs, campus ATM backbones
are now relatively cost effective- even where the "campus" is a
large building.

This is particularly so when one looks at the cost of managed
ports, the ATM application used by most sites.

In addition, the advantages of ATM, such as extending VLANs beyond
a single hub, are other cost-effective factors that work in ATM's
favour.

VLANs in and of themselves are not generally of major interest to
the average network manager.

Capabilities of VLANs

However, the sort of capabilities they provide such as load
balancing across collision domains, isolating various types of
traffic or categories of users, logically distributing server-based
applications while physically centralising equipment, are
persuasive arguments for deploying systems with a VLAN capability.

For example, a university might wish to isolate student, research
staff and administrative traffic.

A VLAN built on an ATM backbone would permit each group to be
assigned a logically separate, campus-wide, network.

An interconnection between these networks could be made, for
example at some convenient central point via any appropriate
combination of routers and firewalls.

Such a network would need only a single media link, such as
ordinary multi-mode fibre, between each building in the campus,
perhaps similar links within larger buildings, and a series of VLAN
capable, hubs-DECHub 900s, 3Com sONCore or Bay 5000 are some
possibilities.

These could be connected either directly or via some form of third
party concentrator to the ATM backbone.

In the case of hubs, like the DECHub, which have tight integration
between their back plane VLAN capability and that of their options,
this requires the simple inclusion of an ATM switch option in the
hub.

VLANs created within the hub's backplane or option modules can be
extended across the ATM network with no more effort than
configuring the original VLAN.

In the case of hubs which do not have such tight integration, the
VLAN is created within the hub and a router option added.

This router is then connected to the ATM network in such a way that
the ATM network appears as several discrete logical ports.

This leads to the potential for the situation described in the
example above in reference to the potential for convergence
problems with routing algorithms.

Maximum Bandwidth

However, since the maximum bandwidth between the routers and the
maximum throughput of the routers is known (as we have maximum
performance figures for the routers and we would be working in a
campus environment where device latencies are either known or can
be easily measured) we could build such a network with sufficient
excess capacity to make the probability of flooding any one ATM
switch very low- not eliminate it, just make it very low.

Alternatively we could deploy a campus backbone in the form of a
device using Ipsilon's IP switching technology or something
similar, when such competitive products become available.

Digital may be the first to market this sort of technology but it
is unlikely that they will be the last.

In most other areas there has been little practical change in the
state of play with ATM.

LAN emulation continues to underwhelm anyone who looks at it too
closely, wide area ATM services are still mainly experimental and
of debatable cost efficiency to either the carriers or their
customers, and carrier level backbone ATM is still looking like a
world of static PVCs.

There is also the question of deployment time frames versus
standards developments.

In the wide area, carriers plan in terms of five, 10 or 15 years
for major changes to their networks and recovering the cost of such
changes.

In a campus environment, a carrier's customers typically require a
minimum of two to three years to recover the cost of new equipment.

Changing Standards

Standards change significantly within 12 months and such changes
require expensive upgrades or straight replacement of equipment.

ATM will not find the sort of general acceptance that technologies
such as ISDN, FDDI, or 100Base-T have.

On the other hand if, or when, the benefits of VLANs based on ATM,
Ipsilon/Digital's implementation of IP switching, or some other
generally useful application of ATM technology, find favour with
and are deployed by, a significant section of the market, the
process of standards development will slow to a more economically
expectable pace.

Stay tuned. The ATM World Series is far from over.

FORUM ON VOICE IN ATM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

ATM for carriers: Is it real? According to Norman Gale, Nortel's
director of Magellan marketing, Asia-Pacific, the ATM forum's
discussions on ATM Adaption Layer (AAL) should be of interest to
telcos.

Said Gale, "To enable voice over ATM more efficeintly, the new AAL
6 is being proposed to code voice channels."

AAL 6 examines the streaming of multiple channels into ATM cells
and according to Gale, it is addressing two issues: Packing cell
density and minimising delay (echo cancellation).

"This will solve the issue of narrowband-to-broadband
internetworking," adds Gale.

Overall, the ATM wave in the Asia-Pacific is still in the testing
stages and according to Gale, it is in the backbone services that
ATM should figure prominently at the initial stages.

In the Enterprise market, Nortel is working on its ATM technologies
with Fore Systems.

Gale sees at the moment, 34 Mbps ATM may be next step for the WAN
market, which is increasingly being driven by newer technologies
like Frame Relay.

BAY TARGETS ACCESS EDGE MARKET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SIMON CHEW

BAY Networks is banking on the recent growth in the Internet and
Intranet markets to capitalise on an emerging need in the
telecommunications market.

At the recent Partnersphere Executive Conference held in Bali,
Bruce Sachs, executive vice president and general manager of Bay's
Internet/Telecom Access business unit, revealed that Bay is
targeting the access edge of service providers.

Said Sachs, "With our Baystream product, we can do both Routing and
Frame Relay (FR) switching on the same hardware, so that it is
possible to build one large network that provides both FR access
and leased-line routing or dial-up connections to the Internet."

Sachs added that this was useful due to the competitive nature of
service provision where the price of connectivity is becoming more
and more of a commodity. A network that offers both services will
then lower the cost of ownership for the provider.

With the recent acquisitions of Lancity, a cable TV modem vendor
and Penril's DSP modem business, Bay is now offering a software-
driven access architecture that is scalable and lower priced to
boot. Sachs sees personal video-conferencing as an application that
is beginning to take off here.

Said Sachs, "We again, have the ability to provide multiple
services from one hardware platform with software upgrade, thus
lowering costs and ownership."

Bay also sees an opportunity in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), in
the telecommunications sphere.

Based on their experience US-based Concentric Networks, (which has
VPNs in Europe and are looking for links in the Asia-Pacific), Bay
is confident that on-line services like interactive games and
banking will make an impact in the region.

Addressing the need of product differentiation by ISPs, Sachs
explained that Bay could offer ISPs a VPN solution that makes it
possible to attain a guaranteed QoS to their customers.

PHILIPS THROWS DOWN GAUNLET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

You get a new phone if yours does not work. This is the claim from
Philips three months after it introduced its first GSM phone
(Fizz). Philips has launched a line-up of new products as part of
its new aggressive marketing to capture market share.

In line with its aim to reach a 20 per cent penetration in the
Asia-Pacific markets, Philips has unveiled the First Choice
Programme, an extensive customer service support that guarantees,
in the event that your cellular phone fails to function, it will be
replaced within 24 hours, anywhere in the world.

Said Simon Roper, GM of Philips Consumer Communications (PCC) in
Asia-Pacific, "This is good for customers as they can use another
phone right away and distributor need not bother with an angry
customer. It will also be beneficial for operators as it minimises
their network losses."

Added Roper, "Our objective is to become one of the top three
manufacturers in consumer telephony by the year 2000."

The new products include the Spark GSM phone, boasting the longest
talk and standby time and offers a duo sim concept.

Said Roper, "The duo sim concept allows either a full sized SIM
card or a plug-in card to address the concerns of celluar users
today." Chalk one up for Philip's strategy to lure customers from
its competitors?

Other members of the product line include the Fizz Etac phone, two
new pagers, and a new DECT cordless phone, the Xalio.

For mobile data communications, there are now two new cards
available, the Mobile Data Card and the Twin Data Card.

Unique in the Twin Data Card is the option to switch between
cellular network and the PSTN via an adapter that allows normal
phone jack connection.

The new lineup will be manufactured in Singapore.

ORBCOMM SERVICES FOR ASIA REGION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Subscribers in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei can use Orbcomm's
global 2-way messaging from 1998 onwards once Malaysia-based TRI
completes its US$8 million gateway late next year.

With twenty-six satellites  scheduled for launch next year, Orbcomm
users can send and receive real-time messages anywhere in the world
with US$1000 hand-held units equipped with GPS, LCD screen and
keypad.

The cost of this service, said Alan Parker, president of Orbcomm
must be close to the paging level for Orbcomm to succeed.

However, the larger market, said Parker, would  come from
industrial users, transportation and the search and rescue
services. For Malaysia, TRI believes that the main business would
come from tracking and data messaging services.

Added Parker, "The total market is divided into two basic user
types: machine-to-machine applications fro tracking and monitoring
where a sensor initiates the communication, and personal
communications services where an individual initiates the
communication."

Parker estimated the total market to be worth about 168 million
subscriber units with a third of the demand coming from Asia.

NEW ISSUES FOR NEW NETWORKS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BEN CHONG

The installation of full service networks (FSN) has thrown up
several new issues in test and measurements for service operators.

FSNs are networks set up to carry digital voice, video and data
traffic as well as establish a foundation for the future
interactive multimedia services much bandied about now. However,
according to Tektronix, cable TV operators learning to offer voice
services and traditional telcos who are going big with VOD are
encountering new issues when installing their core and access
networks.

Said Linc Reed-Nickerson, product marketing manager, Transmission
Test, Tektronix: "New services create new problems. Cable operators
and telcos understand their traditional services well, but they now
must learn how to optimise for new services."

FSNs are mostly based on the broadband Synchronous Digital
Hierarchy (SDH) technology, including new installations in China,
with architectures based mostly on a hybrid fibre/coax physical
media.

Tektronix says that the digital signal now contains a complex mix
of voice, video and data traffic which causes problems in the
transmission, if the test and measurement equipment used during
installation and regular maintenence of the network are not
sophisticated enough to capture and analyse the signals.

Compounding the difficulties is the fact that ATM and MPEG-2 are
the technologies providing video transport on SDH networks. MPEG-2
drop-outs are especially noticeable.

Said Reed-Nickerson, "In the analogue world, you could judge
picture quality from the video picture. In the digital world,
degradation sets in immediately, not gradually. The picture just
goes away suddenly."

A whole new barrage of tests are now essential, said Reed-
Nickerson. Timing and synchronisation tests are vital because of
the hybrid SDH/PDH networks and the fact that video and ATM-based
voice require high quality timing.

Jitter and wander test functions are now also essential to maintain
service quality measurements.Tektronix says that low frequency
jitter causes video subcarrier phase shift which causes colour loss
in the video.

In addition, hybrid analogue-digital systems produce distortions
associated with purely analogue systems. Some of these distortions
include composite triple beat, composite second order, cross
modulation and ingress. Newly introduced measurement devices, such
as Tektronix' Tek 2715 allow the pin-pointing of all such
distortions.

Operators also need to know that better indicators of signal
quality have to be used. For example, using raw Bit Error Rate is a
better indicator of system performance problems than using the
corrected BER.

Understanding the FSN is increasing at a steady pace in Asia. Said
Reed-Nickerson, "Last year operators asked about access network
testing only. Now questions about core network installation have
surfaced. It is an indication of the new digital services being
deployed such as ISDN and compressed voice."

LOW-DENSITY MARKET A FERTILE GROUND?

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SIMON CHEW

Wireless is undoubtedly the "in" technology of this decade. The
many cellular networks are testimony to the effective
infrastructure that it provides. However, the low-density market is
undermining its cost efficiency.

According to Steve Chen, vice-president, marketing of Celcore,
operators are able to achieve revenue targets from urban networks
due to the optimisation from the large number of subscribers. In
the rural market, operators have been reluctant to offer
sophisticated services.

Said Chen, "The low-density market may not be profitable as the
system may not be optimised."

In fact, most operators offset the costs by charging their urban
subscribers a higher price.

Celcore has identified the potential of the low-density market and
offers a solution for operators.

Taking a cue from the client-server (network centric) model in the
computing industry, Celcore offers a distributed network approach
to deliver wireless services without backhauling other networks.

The Globalhub from Celcore is an intelligent network platform that
functions as the Authorisation and Call Routing Equipment (ACRE) in
a cellular system (through IS-41) to offer advanced personal
mobility services and one-number access.

In addition, Celcore's Globalsystem product family supports
protocols like AMPS, ETACS, GSM and PCS and enables carriers to
tailor their networks according to the number of subscribers.

Said Chen, "We are evolving digital interfaces to support CDMA and
TDMA as well."

Leverage

With a regional office already in India, Celcore's latest venture
was a partnership with Thailand's UCOM, which, according to Chen,
will leverage on the latter's experience in system implementation
in the region.

The agreement calls for Celcore to offer turnkey solutions to
wireless operators as well as introducing UCOM as a potential
operating partner. In addition, Celcore has entered the Indonesian
market with a contract to expand Komselindo's AMPS network.

AT&T COMMITTED TO INDIA'S TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SHIRISH NADKARNI

IN the wake of the corruption controversy embracing former
telecommunications minister Pandit Sukh Ram, there are serious
doubts  whether the telecom tenders approved by the former minister
will be allowed to go through. But John Legere, president of Asia-
Pacific for the American telecom giant AT&T, has no doubt that the
projects which have already been taken up will be undisturbed.

#APT: Why hasn't AT&T done much in the long-distance telephony
segment  in India?

Legere: You may know that AT&T is a founder-member of the World
Partners Association (WPA), which is an alliance of carriers. Most
Asian PTTs are members of this alliance; and we are trying to
convince Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), the country's
overseas telecommunications arm, to become a part of it. VSNL is an
entity most suitable to serve our multi- national customers in
India, so we are looking at a partnership with it.

Once it is part of the WPA, we can work together towards seamlessly
serving the global needs of Indian customers, and also serving our
multinational customers in India. We will offer private line Frame
Relay and PTN services.

APT: But aren't there other similar alliances like, for example,
Global One?#

Legere: There is Global One, there is Concert. The model they offer
is more of an invest-when-you-can, ally-when-you-have-to type.
WPA's success has been substantial in Asia, where carriers have
felt threatened by other alliances, and have wanted to bind
together. We feel we have a formula that is best for VSNL and
India.

APT: Why has AT&T  missed the bus, as far as basic services are
concerned?

Legere: We had studied the Indian market for a full 18 months
before we bid for basic services in the telecom circles which
offered, from our  point of view, the most potential.

We contacted more than 10,000 customers, and did a massive amount
of technological research on Indian requirements. Even our bids in
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Karnataka were pretty aggressive-
perhaps more aggressive than any other multinational player.

But we didn't get the circles we wanted, and those were the only
ones we were prepared to bid for. Now that they are gone, we will
concentrate on wireless services in the two states we have and
establish our brand and service in India.

APT: Have you faced any major obstacles in the cellular arena?#

Legere: Well, we are definitely concerned about the allocation of
frequencies, and we have made these concerns known to the
authorities. They are urgent, day-to-day problems, but they have
not slowed us down. We are still on schedule to start our services
by Christmas. Meanwhile, we are optimistic that, if the government
has said it will address the problems we are facing, it will stick
to its word.

APT: Why has AT&T chosen to concentrate outside the US?

Legere: Look at it from the opposite side. Five years ago, India
did not even figure among the top 50 countries in the world, in
terms of usage of telecom services. Now the traffic out of this
country is expanding by leaps and bounds, and it is already in the
top 20.

We have estimated that, by  2005, India will be one of the three
biggest traffic streams to the US. Once the tele-density in India
and China grows, the traffic streams will be unparalleled and we
want to be part of the action.

APT: For the future, which other countries are you looking at,
especially in Asia?#

Legere: We have a thoughtful, focussed and aggressive globalisation
strategy; and have targeted countries we wish to go into. Apart
from India, we are building infrastructure in Canada and the UK.

So far as Asia is concerned, our largest investments are in India,
where we have made a commitment of US$1.5 billion. Our other major
investment in cellular services is in Hong Kong, where we have a
venture called Smartone.

We are also significantly expanding our on-line services in Asia.
We have advanced services delivered through the Internet in Hong
Kong, Japan and Australia. India is potentially a huge market for
Internet services, and if those licences are given out, we will
definitely be interested.

We are looking to bid in several other Asian countries, like
Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia, all of which
provide major opportunities. However, you must appreciate that we
have to pick and choose the places where we want to have major
investments; and, in Asia, we have consciously chosen India.

PLDT JOINS THE PHILIPPINE INTERNET BANDWAGON

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) has taken
control of the Philippines' leading Internet Service Provider
(ISP)-an event greeted with dismay by ISPs and subscribers wary of
PLDT's embrace.

Infocom Technologies,  which claims 60 per cent of the Philippines'
infant Internet market, elected a PLDT man, Renato Gendrano,
president and CEO in September. Gendrano said the new owners wanted
to "accelerate the growth of Infocom's Internet business". Their
vision was to build a second Internet Backbone and to make the Net
more accessible.

Gendrano announced that Infocom intends to install 200 new digital
lines to give dial-up users faster access to the Net. He also said
Infocom would launch new products such as Philippine-wide roaming
access through a 1-800 number; e-mail to paging capability and pre-
paid Internet cards for international access. Funding will be
generated by the capital markets, loans and direct capital infusion
from PLDT.

Infocom subscribers access the Net via an E1 gateway with a speed
of 2.048 Mbps , the fastest and largest among all ISPs. Infocom
claims 3,000 direct subscribers. Add to this the subscribers
brought in by its 16 resellers and Infocom's total subscriber base
amounts to around 20,000.

Infocom expects this base to increase 15 per cent by end-1996.
Gendrano said Infocom is targeting an astounding 400 per cent
growth in 1997.

Small Slice of Pie

Whatever the real number of subscribers, the size of the
Philippines' Internet subscriber pie is far too small for the
booming number of ISPs. Industry estimates place the total number
of ISPs at an astonishing 79. In contrast, there were some 22 ISPs
last March and only 6 in August 1995.

About four-fifths of these ISPs are resellers who sell access to
the Net but who do not necessarily have all the hardware and
services of a major ISP. Both resellers and major ISPs are fighting
for a market estimated from 40,000 to about 100,000 subscribers.

Industry sources estimated the number of Net users at only 15,000
last March and expected this to double at year-end.

Internet access rates in the Philippines are cheap and the intense
competition is expected to drive prices down even further.

Executive Power Centre rocked the industry early this year by
offering access at only P90 (US$3) per hour and the same rate for
every succeeding hour. Infocom charges individual subscribers a low
P800 (US$30) per month and corporate subscribers P50,000 (US$1,900)
per month for leased connections. ISPs charge a one-time connection
fee that ranges from P90 to P50,000.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM MUSCLES INTO PHILIPPINES TELECOM PIE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY PETER GALACE

DEUTSCHE Telekom has become a key player in the intensely
competitive Philippine telecoms industry with its equity
acquisition in Isla Telecommunications (Islacom).

Islacom is a CMTS and IGF operator lagging in its commitment to
install 700,000 telephone landlines by 1998.

DT becomes Islacom's second strategic partner after Thailand's
Shinawatra International.

Islacom Stake

Sources in Philippine telecoms speculate that DT will acquire a 20
per cent stake in Islacom at the expense of Shinawatra, which now
controls 30 per cent.

The remaining 70 per cent is held by Asia Communications Holdings
(Asiacom), a Filipino company controlled by the Delgado family.

Islacom has so far refused to confirm the extent of DT's equity
stake.

Islacom only acknowledges that it had entered into a "technical
partnership" with DT.

Simeon Kintanar, commissioner of the National Telecommunications
Commission (NTC) said DT is infusing both equity and technology
into Islacom.

Kintanar attended the signing of the joint venture agreement
between DT and Islacom in early September.

At press time, the signing ceremony was to have taken place in
Manila.

Islacom was identified by the NTC, the government agency that
regulates Philippine telecoms, as one of six companies lagging in
its LEC commitments as of the first half of the year.

Islacom has an obligation to install 130,000 landlines in 1996 and
443,000 landlines in 1997.

The company estimates that it will need P25 billion (US$1 billion)
for its LEC project in the next five years.

Following the signing of the joint venture agreement, DT advanced
US$40 million for Islacom's LEC roll-out programme and cellular
operations.

Industry observers say Islacom sought a second strategic partner
because Shinawatra is unable to extend the capital requirements
needed by Islacom projects in the next 10 years.

Islacom also has a licence for paging operations, but is not
actively engaged in this service.

Sources say DT may have cast its lot with Islacom because the
latter's LEC service area is one of the most lucrative in the
Philippines.

Cebu City is acknowledged as the Manila of the south and is
experiencing an economic boom.

Islacom's LEC service area in southern Philippines includes Cebu,
Mandaue, Negros Oriental, Negros Occidental, Siquijor, Samar,
Leyte, Iloilo, Bacolod, Bohol, Aklan, Antique, Capiz and Guimaras.

Lucent Agreement

The company recently signed a US$43 million agreement with Lucent
Technologies Philippines (an AT&T subsidiary) for its LEC project
and the improvement of its international gateway switch.

Islacom is one of five Philippine CMTS (cellular mobile telephone
service) providers.

It is ranked either fourth or fifth in the number of subscribers
and it has 40,000 subscribers to date.

BINARIANG AIMS FOR FULL SPECTRUM OF SATELLITE SERVICES IN ASIA-PACIFIC

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BEE-KAY SEN

MALAYSIA will launch its second satellite Measat-2 into orbit on
Nov 13.

It will be placed into the 148 degrees east orbital slot while
Measat-1 is currently positioned at 91.5 degrees   east.

"By putting Measat-2 at 148 degrees east, the footprints of the
satellites will be extended up to east Australia and Hawaii,"
Binariang's senior manager Abdul Halim Abdul Hamid said in Kuala
Lumpur recently.

Besides Malaysia, the footprints of both satellites will cover
Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. Binariang
is the owner and operator of the two satellites and has three
orbital slots.

Arianespace has been chosen to launch the satellite from the
European space port in Kourou, French Guiana. Both satellites are
manufactured by Hughes.

The second satellite has been flown to Kourou, where it will be
tested before being encapsulated into the Arianespace launch
vehicle, Ariane 44L, for launching. The launch vehicle will have a
co-passenger, Arabsat.

Additional Equipment

Additional equipment and a ground antenna is being installed at the
Langkawi control centre to accommodate Measat-2 as it will be in a
different orbital slot.

Binariang has invested RM600 million (US$235.8 million) for the
manufacturing and launching of the two satellites as well as ground
facilities.

Achieving breakeven for both satellites is expected to be in less
than five years.

Halim said besides leasing transponders, Binariang was aiming to
provide a full spectrum of satellite services with both the
satellites in orbit.

Binariang is considering providing Vsat (very small aperature
terminal) services by next year. It recently teamed-up with Hughes
to provide the terminals.

This is in line with providing rural telephony which can be linked
to the PSTN, via the satellite. Halim said this mode is more cost
effective as operational costs are lower.

Binariang is also forging alliances and partnerships with
international satellite and broadcasting players in the region to
lease satellite transponders.

Binariang is also considering launching Measat-3 by 1998, which
will be a much bigger satellite than Measat-1 and 2. Details are
being worked out but Binariang is aiming to provide global coverage
and a lot more capacity.

All the 15-Ku band transponders have been leased to its affiliate
company Measat Broadcast Network.

The affiliate recently launched the country's first 23-channel
satellite television and radio network known as Astro (All Asian
Television and Radio Company). Measat Broadcast Network hopes to
target 1 million subscribers (20 per cent market share) by year
2000.

It is anticipated that there will be five million homes with
television sets in the country by then.

More than 80 per cent of Measat Broadcast Network's revenue will
come from subscription fees with the remaining 15 per cent through
the sale of air time.

Measat Broadcast Network will levy an RM80 (US$31.44) monthly
charge for the 23 digital satellite TV and eight radio channels.
This is in addition to the one-off installation and equipment
charge of RM1,680 (US$660.24), which includes the satellite dish,
digital satellite receiver (DSR), remote control and smart card to
be purchased by subscribers directly from Philips, which has
exclusive rights.

Measat Broadcast Network needs an average of 700,000 subscribers to
breakeven.

"We can reach that figure in two and a half to three years' time,"
Measat Broadcast Network's chief operating officer, Paul Edwards
said, after the launch of Astro in Kuala Lumpur on Sep 25.

Measat Broadcast Network has so far invested RM500 million
(US$196.5 million) and intends to invest an additional RM500
million to expand Astro's broadcasting and production complex, the
All Asian Broadcasting Centre (ABC) and programming as well. Astro
will offer its services to neighbouring countries by early 1997,
Edwards added.

DTU Service

The direct-to-user (DTU) service can be made available to 30
million subscribers in India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia,
Taiwan and east Australia. However, Singapore is  not too keen on
the DTV service being aired within as it already has its own cable
TV network.

The Astro service is also an interactive multimedia platform
capable of delivering services such as home banking and shopping,
stock exchange information and Internet access as well. These
services will be introduced next year.

DSC DIPS IN THE FACE OF ORDER SLOWDOWN

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BENNY TAN

The stock of DSC Communications, a designer, developer,
manufacturer and marketer of digital switching, transmission,
access and private network system products, took a big plunge after
the company said its latest quarter results will not meet analysts'
estimates because of order slowdown and an inventory writeoff.

DSC's shareprice is currently at about US$17: Down more than 70 per
cent after a high of US$60 last year. Revenues are expected to be
at about US$330 million, with earnings at about breakeven. Wall
Street analysts are expecting US$0.24 a share. A year ago, earnings
were US$49.4 million or US$0.42 a share on sales of US$370 million.

Disappointing product sales included the Litespan-120, an
international loop access product and iMTN, a next-generation
digital cross connect. DSC is also taking an after-tax charge of
US$60 million to write off wireless products that cannot be used
because of interference with military equipment, as well as payment
for restructuring.

Last month, Alcatel won a contract with Motorola, beating out DSC.

Earnings are expected to be lower due to:

Lower revenues from Litespan sales driven by a drop in linecard
sales even though infrastructure sales increased.

Lower revenues from transport products, specifically for
traditional cross-connects due to purchase delays by customers.

Lower gross margins due to lower volume and a shift in product mix
in the Litespan area, from high margin linecards to lower margin
infrastructure.

Lower than expected initial demand for new products including
Airspan and iMTN.

Intelligent Service

DSC recently clinched a multi-million dollar contract to supply IXC
Communications, a suite of intelligent network equipment, including
its intelligent service peripheral (ISP), which combines features
of both service control points and intelligent peripherals.

The systems will allow IXC to offer 800/888 services, call routing
and customised account codes to subscribers.

New Advanced Solutions

DSC's new products which were demonstrated at the NCF InfoVision
'96 tradeshow included switched digital video (SDV), an application
enabling carriers to offer a variety of new interactive digital
video applications, including movies-on-demand, home shopping and
distance learning services.

Other new products in the access area are the Litespan 2000, 2012
and the Litecraft. Switching products include the iMPAX 5420 and
iMPAX 5001.

DSC also  demonstrated a portfolio of narrowband, wideband and
broadband transmission products including digital cross-connects
and transcoders.

MUTIARA'S PROGRESS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

MUTIARA Telecommunications is coming along strongly with its plans
to be a more aggressive player.

This follows its partnership with Swiss Telecom.

Mutiara sprung a surprise announcement recently when it revealed
its plan to tie up with 60 property developers to offer domestic
and international services.

The tie up is expected to take place over the next two years.

These services will be provided to new development sites in the
country.

Mutiara marked its entry by recently signing up with the first
developer, Bukit Tinggit Resort.

Earlier, Mutiara had announced that its priority was to set up its
international gateway first.

It is believed that this gateway will be operational soon.

After it sets up its international gateway, Mutiara intends to
offer a fixed network service.

To date, Binariang is in the lead with 111 contracts. Other players
include Telekom Malaysia with 69 contracts and Celcom with less
than 60.

CELCOM IN SABAH

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

CELCOM has been awarded two contracts valued at RM74 million (US$29
million) for the implementation of a 2,000 km fibre-optic network
in Sabah.

The fibre-optic cable will be installed within the transmission
grid of the Sabah Electricity Board.

The two companies which will lay the cables and provide equipment
are Uniphone and Teknolite. Uniphone is a fibre-optic cable
supplier.

Celcom has formed a joint venture company- Celcom Timur (Sabah)-
with the Sabah state government via Warisan Harta. Work on the
project will commence soon and is scheduled to be completed in a
year's time.

The project will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will
cover 696 km including a 19 km long submarine network, while the
second phase will cover the remaining 794 km.

Celcom is the first company to set up a comprehensive fibre-optic
network spanning the state. It has a similar arrangement with
Sarawak Electricity Corp (SESCO) in the state of Sarawak.

TRI ANNOUNCES MEASURES TO STOP RAMPANT SHARE SPECULATION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BEE-KAY SEN

IN September, wild speculation surrounding Technology Resources
Industries (TRI) led to its share price taking a severe beating.
The counter registered the year's low of RM6.05 (US$2.38) on Sep
24-a 30 per cent fall in its share price.

Two days later, a foreign newspaper reported that TRI's deal with
Deutsche Telekom (DT) could hit a snag, further dampening the weak
sentiment. This coincided with speculation that DT had doubts over
TRI's prospects in an already overcrowded, highly competitive
sector. TRI refuted within the same day saying it would formalise
its deal with DT in October, thereby quieting rumours of its
troubled DT deal. TRI disclosed that it had signed the Management
Agreement, and Technical Assistance and Training Agreement with DT,
signifying DT's ready participation in TRI.

TRI executives are denying the allegation, but those close to the
deal revealed that DT had requested for a re-negotiation. DT has,
however, kept silent over the matter. A research analyst said DT
did not want to be left out of the booming Asian telecommunications
business and was keen to establish a foothold in Asia via TRI.

"It would not jeopardise its plans here just because TRI's share
price plunged. However if DT had requested for re-negotiations, it
was part of the provisions in the preliminary agreement between TRI
and DT in May  should TRI's share price come down", said the
analyst.

TRI announced on Sep 26 that it had revised the sale price per
share to be paid by DT from RM9.50 (US$3.73) to RM9.25 (US$3.64).
TRI said it will issue 68.07 million new shares which represents 10
per cent of TRI's existing paid up capital.

ING Barings analyst Soon Teck Onn commented that the price
difference was negligible and reflected DT's keenness in acquiring
a stake in TRI. DT had agreed in May to buy a 21 per cent stake in
TRI in two installments. The first installment will involve 68.07
million new TRI shares, while the second installment of the
remaining 11 per cent, will come from the existing shareholders.

Under the preliminary agreement, the price of RM9.50 (US$3.73)
could be re-negotiated if the TRI stock price slipped below RM7.46
(US$2.93) before the alliance agreement was sealed. DT will now pay
TRI RM629.64 million (US$247.45 million) for the 10 per cent stake
(or the first installment), instead of the RM646.66 million
(US$254.14 million). The entire 21 per cent transaction is tagged
at RM1.39 billion (US$546.27 million).

The remaining 11 per cent stake may be acquired by DT from TRI's
chief Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli.

VSNL ANNOUNCES US$1.27 BILLION TELECOM PLAN

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

by SHIRISH NADKARNI

BK Syngal, chairman of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (VSNL), has
announced a Rs45 billion (US$1.27 billion) programme for telecoms
during the ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002).

The plans include projects for gateway switches, earth stations,
optical fibre cable systems, information superhighway nodes, DTH
systems and network management facilities.

There are also plans for a regional submarine fibre optic cable,
OASIS, to develop India as a regional hub for telecom traffic, and
to install state-of-the-art high capacity switches at metro
centres.

VSNL has already made commitments to expand its international high
speed connectivity through SEA-ME-WE-3 and flag optical fibre
systems.

Said Syngal, "At present, there is
a shortfall of about Rs25 billion (US$704 million) in financing the
expansion plans.

"Thus, we have proposed a re-launch of our Euro-issue of global
depository receipts. The proposal has been submitted to the DoT
after approval by the VSNL board."

The organisation registered a gross income of Rs44.73 billion
(US$1.26 billion) during the financial year 1995-96, and a post-tax
profit of Rs4.09 billion (US$115 million).

Syngal called for an attitudinal change and a more focused approach
on the part of its two key state-owned partners-the DoT and the
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL)-in providing good service.

Maintenance Problems

"Although VSNL has been designated a single-window clearance agency
for leased line services, the maintenance of these lines has become
a problem because of co-ordination problems and a lack of co-
operation from the DoT and the MTNL," Syngal said.

BT LEADS ASIA-PACIFIC WITH FRAME RELAY CHARGE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SIMON CHEW

British Telecom (BT), believes that Frame Relay services (FRS) are
growing due to the need for faster data transfers and an increase
in demand for LAN interconnections at lower costs.

Last month, BT launched its FRS in Malaysia with Telekom Malaysia
(TM) selling and managing the Concert portfolio of global data
services. So far, 30 FRS customers has signed up.

According to Dr. Mohd Khir Harun, senior vice-president, major
business and government of TM, "Through this strategic alliance, we
hope to offer global communications solutions, enabling companies
in Malaysia to compete globally."

BT has FRS in 11 countries and has 600 ports installed in the
region.

Ann-Marie Leyendecker, business line manager of BT's Asia-Pacific
data network business, said that new services like LAN-dial and
ISDN access will be offered soon.

"For ISDN backup, we are rolling the infrastructure to support this
right now, so by the end of the year, we will have 2 Mbps in the
core countries and by the end of April next year, it will be
available in all the countries in Asia-Pacific."

The next generation of dial-up services, due out next year,
according to Leyendecker, wil provide direct dial-up access into
FR.

JAPAN: DEREGULATES LEASED LINES

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY MIKE GALBRAITH

NTT has received authorisation from the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) to lift the final restriction on
connecting leased circuits to public telephone lines.

NTT has since offered a new service for companies to connect their
leased lines to its public lines from Oct 30.

This will have a major impact on the telecom service market in
Japan, leading to increased competition and lower prices especially
in the long-distance market.

Expectations

Many large corporations can be expected to set up in-house
telephone networks and to try to sell extra capacity to outsiders:
Matsushita announced the setting up of such a network early this
year. Fujitsu and NEC are expected to make similar announcements
soon.

The ban on leasing circuits to public circuits has long been one of
the main pillars of NTT's monopoly.

Under pressure to deregulate, the MPT permitted the linking of one
end of leased circuits to the public network from April 1995 and
NTT has been charging 9,900 (US$93) a month per circuit connection.

NTT's latest initiative can be seen as a move threatening its major
rivals among the new operators-the long distance carriers DDI,
Japan Telecom and Teleway Japan.

Indeed, NTT recently also announced that it would cut the circuit
connection charges to just 1,000 (US$9.40) a month.

The long awaited 100 (US$.94) per three minute long-distance call
could quickly become a reality. NTT's price, which used to be in
the 300 (US$2.80) range, is currently 160 (US$1.50) before taking
into account discounts.

THAILAND DEFERS SIX MILLION TARGET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SUTHISAK KRAISRI

Thailand's six-million fixed-line installation programme is being
pushed back for at least two years, following the reversal of
factors brought about by the current political turnabouts.

Both TelecomAsia (TA) and Thai Telephone & Telecommunication (TT&T)
had admitted out that the project, worth over US$4 billion would
not take place until after 1998. Both organisations made the
statement stating that there are currently ample telephone lines.

"TA, (having 2.6 million lines), will not sell out all of its
telephone lines until 1998," said Supachai Chearavanont, TA's
executive director.

Adisai Bodharamik, CEO of TT&T, (whose 1.5 million lines would be
fully registered by the end of next year), said, "Once you add the
Telephone Organisation of Thailand's (TOT) yet to be installed
800,000 lines, the market will be oversupplied in the next two
years."

At the end of September, the two private fixed-line operators
delivered their combined 4.1 million lines to the TOT, as committed
in their contracts, meeting the country's target of a 10 to 100
teledensity.

In addition, Adisai believed that "repeat orders" with TT&T and TA
would be likely when the demand rises. This means that any new
players would have little chance to enter the market.

Another factor which was said to have delayed the installation
programme was line registration. Registrations fell below target
partly due to the economic slowdown during the past year. The
result was that both operators could only sell less than half of
their ready lines by the second quarter of this year.

Due to the general election this month following the House
dissolution in late September, major projects have been put on
hold. Thus, TA and TT&T are enjoying a duopoly, at least until the
turn of the century.

However, there was a price to pay: The tight Sep 30 delivery
deadline forced the two telcos to spend heavily on telephone lines
construction. As sales were below expectations, their second
quarter performance disappointed investors.

"Their sales of telephone lines was slow, even in the fisrt
quarter. This means slower gains compared to growing operating
costs," said an analyst.

Mobile Market

Meanwhile, equipment makers have been monitoring market movements.
Suppliers like Lucent are concentrating on the mobile phone market
as the pending six-million line programme "will not happen soon,"
said a Lucent senior executive.

BINARIANG RISES TO MALAYSIAN TELECOMS CHALLENGE

Binariang scotched talk that it is way behind with plans to become
Malaysia's second carrier with last week's successful launch of the
country's first telecoms satellite.

The on-schedule launch, from the European Space Agency facility in
Kourou, French Guiana, put Malaysia on a par with its neighbours in
terms of satellite TV capability and reaffirmed Binariang's commitment
to challenge the mostly government-owned Telekom Malaysia in every
sector of its business.

Binariang, which paid for the Arianespace launch, holds licences for a
cellular network, a satellite communications system, international
gateway services and a fixed network - the only Malaysian company so
endowed.

The company reckons its advanced 2-satellite system - a second Hughes
Space & Communications Co. spacecraft will be lofted in the middle of
the year - will give it the technological muscle to beat the best
telecoms service providers at home and abroad.

The first of the satellites has 5 high power Ku-band transponders and
12 C-band transponders which will give Binariang the capacity for 40
digital TV channels, 8 digital radio channels, a GSM cellular system
and the digital firepower to fulfil its domestic and international
telecoms aspirations.

Binariang - controlled by Malaysian oil, gaming and property tycoon
Ananda Krishnan - will beam only TV programming approved by the
government. Except for Singapore, Malaysia is now the only Southeast
Asian country that outlaws satellite TV.

Legislation is passing through parliament to change the law so that
Binariang can beam into Malaysian homes - and those beyond. But there
is no legislation that will help Binariang beat the 7 other companies
muscling for a slice of the telecoms market in Malaysia.

Competitors say that because Binariang has been late in getting its
fully digital GSM cellular network up and running, the company has made
it easier for less worthy competitors to resist government attempts to
force mergers in the overcrowded industry. Because of the late GSM
start-up, Binariang is now competing in a 5-way battle for the 600,000
or so Malaysians that own mobile phones (See APTA July 17).

Late last year Binariang was at pains to deny claims from competitors
that it was behind schedule with its roll out of services. Said Donald
Swan, Binariang's chief operations officer: "If you launch 4 lines of
business on an integrated basis in 12 months there are bound to be
problems". Swan is also a vice president of US West, which last year
took a 20 per cent stake in Binariang for an estimated $230m.

A huge potential problem for Binariang is the government's abrupt
policy reversal last June (See APTA June 5). After handing out licences
to all comers, Kuala Lumpur decided there had been too many takers and
that a shake-out should be engineered. Prime Minister Mahathir said:
"If possible, there should be mergers among them so that there are only
3 or 4 companies."

At a heated meeting in September, the licence holders said they had no
intention of doing this. The government had issued the licences and was
legally obliged to honour the commitments it had made.

Binariang, Time Telekom and Mutiara Telecommunications all insist that
they are going ahead with their investments - despite rumblings from
within government about overcapacity and duplication and agreement
within industry that there will undoubtedly be some rationalisation at
a future point. On this, Swan said: "There is going to be a shakeout in
this new industry and Malaysia is going to be no exception. You will
see mergers and partnerships and people becoming niche players."

A long shot is for Time Telekom, part of the politically well connected
Renong group, to buy a controlling share of Telkom Malaysia from the
government.

A fourth likely survivor would be Celcom, the first private cellular
network and by far the biggest with over 75 per cent of cellular
subscribers. For 1996, the big action in the Malaysian telecoms
industry is going to be in mergers and acquisitions.

AUSTRALIA: FOXTEL-AUSTRALIS MERGER FACING RESISTANCE FROM WATCHDOG

The A$700m merger of Foxtel, the cable TV partnership of Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. and national carrier Telstra, and Australis Media,
the microwave and satellite broadcaster, is striking unexpectedly stiff
resistance from Australia's competition watchdog.

This is good news for Optus Vision, the cable TV and telephony arm of
Australia's second carrier Optus Communications, which faced a bleak
future if the merger of Australis and Foxtel was approved
unconditionally. The merger would cut the number of players in
Australia's fledgling pay TV industry from 3 to 2 and combine Telstra's
comfortable lead over Optus Vision in cable rollout with Australis'
monopoly over satellite and microwave distribution (See APTA October
23).

Although there is no widespread expectation that the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission would actually block the merger,
comments by its chairman, Professor Allen Fels, have raised the
possibility that the ACCC will impose strict conditions.

This would force a rejig of the merger, under which Telstra and Optus
would sell Foxtel to Australis for stock giving them a combined 60.5
per cent of its total capital. They would also have 6 directors out of
10.

Professor Fels said in early January the ACCC was worried about the
impact of the merger on the pay-TV and telephony markets, and that
telephony was of more concern because of its vast size. However, he
stressed that no decision had been made. The merger was announced in
October and Australis and Foxtel said they expected the deal to be put
to Australis shareholders in early December.

They executed formal contracts just before Christmas and Australis
advised the Australian Stock Exchange it expected to release documents
in mid-January for the meeting. Both companies have maintained a
steadfast silence since Professor Fels went public with his concerns
about the merger. They had hoped for a decision at the first meeting of
ACCC members for the new year 2 weeks ago, but nothing emerged except
reports the commissioners had endorsed Professor Fels' hard-line stance
on the merger.

Optus Vision has argued the merger would create a "communications
colossus" that would have "devastating and irreversible" effects on
competition and consumers and threaten Optus Vision's plan to crack
Telstra's local calls monopoly with cheaper local calls.

Australis and Foxtel have replied that the merger would make little
difference to competition in the pay-TV market because the 2 companies
already run common programming under an earlier deal sanctioned last
year by the ACCC's predecessor, the Trade Practices Commission. The TPC
appeared to treat pay-TV operators as participants in a broader TV
market that included terrestrial free to air broadcasters in its
reasons for that decision.

Although it emphasised this did not constitute a final determination of
the relevant market for pay-TV operators, the decision was taken as a
sign that the merger would be approved on the grounds that a merger of
fledgling pay-TV operators would have little impact in a market
dominated by established terrestrial broadcasters. But Professor Fels
played this down, saying the merger could be found to be anti-
competitive in telephony - the bigger market - even if it had been
found not to unduly affect competition in pay TV.

After a slow start Australis' subscriber numbers have more than doubled
in the space of a few months to about 70,000, largely as a result of
having adopted Foxtel's giveaway A$20 connection fee and A$40 a month
subscription rates.

Neither Foxtel nor Optus Vision, which did not launch their services
until September/October, have revealed subscriber numbers.

AUSTRALIA: TELSTRA FACES TARIFF RETHINK

Telstra suffered a setback in its plan to restructure tariffs aimed at
service providers late last year (See APTA December 18). Australia's
telecoms regulator, Austel, rejected 2 new service provider tariffs in
the course of approving a package of changes to residential, consumer
and business tariffs. The changes slashed business line rentals, long
distance and ISDN charges and sharply rationalised Telstra's
bewildering range of flexiplan discount plans.

They were designed to help Telstra compete better with Optus and the
aggressive service providers which have taken $3bn in annual revenues
from Telstra. They also aimed to force a rationalisation among service
providers, especially at the bottom end of the market where aggregators
simply combine the bills of their customers and pass back the resulting
volume discounts to them, leaving Telstra to bill and service them
individually.

The flexiplan changes resulted in the withdrawal of 2 local call plans
that proved extremely popular with aggregators, offering volume
discounts of up to 15 per cent, and replaced fees with per account
thresholds for those that remained.

Telstra argued that the heavy use of these tariffs by simple
aggregators was requiring it to pay the discounts without enjoying the
savings of dealing with a single high volume customer.

The tariffs were replaced by 2 new service provider tariffs offering
discounts of up to 37 per cent on long distance and 8 per cent on local
calls for service providers operating full billing help desks and some
service responsibility.

Telstra's strategy of encouraging service providers to take more
responsibility for billing and service is consistent with the views of
Austel, which does not regard aggregators as sustainable competitors or
believe they bring the same benefits as value added and switched
service providers. But the watchdog nevertheless disallowed the new
service provider tariffs on the grounds that they bundled competitive
services with uncompetitive services (local calls) and did not meet the
needs of the service providers' industry.

Since the disallowance, Telstra has continued to talk to service
provider representatives and was expected to meet with Austel over its
new proposals for these tariffs as APTA went to press.

Telstra was saying nothing about the changes it proposed to satisfy
Austel, but the chairman of the Service Providers Action Network
(SPAN), Brian Perkins, said Telstra was still insisting on bundling
local calls with long distance.

"I don't think what they are proposing is likely to satisfy us or
Austel," said Perkins, a senior executive at the switched reseller AAP
Telecommunications. He added that SPAN had no response from Austel to
its request that the regulator order Telstra to leave its popular local
call flexiplans in place while the fate of the new service provider
tariffs is resolved.

Telstra's new tariffs are slated to take effect on February 1 but
Austel has expressed concern about the inadequate time this leaves the
worst affected service providers to restructure their businesses.

Aggregators are being offered the option of upgrading their facilities
and becoming value added service providers, selling out to a value
added service provider, or applying to become authorised Telstra
dealers on more favourable terms.

AUSTRALIA: GOVERNMENT SAYS "NO" TO UNIVERSAL SERVICES PLAN

A suggestion by national carrier Telstra that services covered by its
universal service obligations be handed over to Australia's telecoms
regulator Austel to put out to tender was quickly stomped on by the
federal government over the Christmas-New Year break.

The suggestion was contained in a submission by Telstra to a government
inquiry into community service obligations under its new competition
regime, which is exposing utilities and the professions to competition
regulation for the first time.

Telstra's submission said the current practice of leaving it with sole
responsibility for providing uneconomical services - such as services
to rural and remote areas and payphones - failed the test of economic
efficiency and was inconsistent with government's plan to bring in more
competition after 1997.

The carrier also said the cross-subsidisation inherent in universal
service reduced incentives for investment by Telstra or other carriers
which might otherwise have entered the market for these services.

Telstra was backed by the Australian Telecommunications Users' Group
(Atug), which agreed that tendering would ensure "the best service is
provided at the best price" and said the way some rural services have
been provided under USO arrangements was "nothing short of appalling".

This was a reference to the digital concentrator radio system (DRCS)
that Telstra uses for remote parts of Australia that can not
economically be reached by landlines.

Telstra chose DRCS over the Aussat satellite service (now owned by the
second carrier Optus Communications) but this is widely believed to
have been a mistake. Atug says DRCS proved "grossly inferior" and the
Aussat satellites "would have been a much superior arrangement."

Optus and AAP Communications - a subsidiary of AAP Information Services
and a corporate half brother to the switched reseller AAP
Telecommunications - both expressed support for the idea and said they
would be interested in looking at any services put up for tender.
However, the Federal communications minister Michael Lee said USO
services would not be put out to tender as the idea had been rejected
when the government fashioned its post-1997 reform package last year.

Opposition communications spokesman Senator Richard Alston supported
Lee and said cross-subsidies from city to rural and remote customers
would remain under his party's plan to privatise Telstra.

Their caution can be explained by the proximity of a tight Federal
election, which must be held by May but is being tipped to be held in
March, and by the electorate's sensitivity to telephone service prices.

Telstra's initiative was reported as an attempt to "privatise"
universal service, but these are already calculated by Austel and paid
for by the 3 carriers in proportion to their revenues. This would
continue if they were put out to tender by Austel.

AAP Communications supplies "full mesh networks" to mining camps using
satellites and Hughes telephony earth stations, including payphone
services that offer employees calls to capital cities at local call
rates.

The group's director of marketing Geoffrey Rolls said it would
"certainly" be interested in providing similar services to Telstra's
rural and remote customers. It could run a network via satellites with
a hub in Sydney or Perth, or alternatively "beam bandwidth into a
remote area then split it off into effectively a local loop," he said.

Mark Harwood, Optus' sales manager for national media, said Optus would
look at any USO services put out to tender but "it would have to be a
business case decision."

HONG KONG: HUTCHISON RESTRUCTURES IN ASIAN EXPANSION DRIVE

Hutchison Whampoa is to revamp its telecoms units as part of a new
expansion drive focusing on the Asia-Pacific region. The company
stressed the move is not preparatory to a separate listing for its
telecoms interests; however, the restructuring would simplify such a
move further down the line.

At the same time, Hutchison bought back a 25 per cent stake in its
paging business from Motorola, the US semiconductor and personal
communications giant. Motorola retains a 30 per cent interest in
Hutchison's Hong Kong cellular telephone business.

Analysts are loathe to rule out the prospect of a future spin-off,
especially now that plans to float Orange, the UK personal
communications network, are coming together.

Under the shake-up, a new umbrella company Hutchison Telecommunications
Hong Kong (HTHK) has been created to consolidate the marketing and
operational resources of Hutchison's mobile telephone, paging and fixed
line network services as well as its trunked radio service in China,
Hong Kong and Macao. The move, in classic Canning Fok style - Fok has
been the group's managing director since 1993 - aims to create
synergies resulting in greater productivity and cost effectiveness.

It is the second big shake-up in Hutchison's 10 year telecoms history.
Hutchison Telecommunications was formed in 1986 to spearhead expansion
in Hong Kong's relatively competitive (that is, cartel-free) paging and
cellular mobile phone sector. However by 1992, having expanded into
overseas markets and nibbled at satellite, Hutchison unveiled a major
retrenchment of its telecoms operations, sacking 40 staff and
surrendering its Asia-Pacific ex-Hong Kong, China and Macao operations
in the process.

This time round there are no casualties, just aggressive expansion
plans. The group will this year invest HK$700m to upgrade its network
services in Hong Kong and expand its mobile infrastructure - the number
of cell sites have already swollen threefold to 300 (from 100) over the
past 5 months.

The company claims to have some 120,000 mobile phone customers and says
about 30,000 customers have subscribed to its recently launched fixed-
line network in Hong Kong. Hutchison plans to double both subscriber
bases this year.

Less bullish is the outlook for the lower market CT2 network, the
sector that proved to be Hutchison's Achilles heel in the UK where it
was ultimately forced to close its Rabbit CT2 operation, writing off
HK$1.4bn in the process. Locally subscribers to Hutchison's CT2 network
have dwindled to below 70,000 from 100,000 last year.

Telecoms businesses in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region will come
under the wing of Hutchison Telecom International, headed up by CN
Khoo. Included here, as well as paging and mobile services, are VSAT
and radio broadcasting.

While Hutchison is one of the colony's leaders in mobile services -
commanding some 18 per cent of the mobile telephone market and 29 per
cent of the pager market - its debut in the fixed network arena at the
end of last year was less pronounced. This is at least partially a
reflection of erstwhile monopoly Hongkong Telecom's stranglehold on the
market and partly to do with Hutchison's own strategy which is broadly
similar to that of fellow new entrants New T&T and New World Telephone
(See APTA June 5).

As well as emphasising discount international calls (still strictly the
exclusive province of Hongkong Telecom, although many loopholes to get
round this exist), all 3 companies are relying on newest technology to
provide a total package for consumers, with a different range of niche
services designed to appeal to business and residential users.

The synergies thrown up by Hutchison's revamp will be seen as the fixed-
network builds on its mobile communications strengths, with wireless
services revolving round the hub of its wireline technology.

The company, again like its 3 new competitors, is bidding for the new
mobile licences which were to have been awarded last year but have been
held up by deliberations in Beijing (See APTA June 19, November 6).

INDIA: BASIC SERVICES AUCTION HEADS FOR THIRD ROUND

Following the poor response to the second round of bidding, the auction
of basic services licences in India is heading for its third round.

The second round which earlier this month drew bids for 5 of the 13
licences on offer, only attracted 6 of the 16 consortia eligible to
bid. Ten groups opted to stay out of the round altogether.

Of the 13 licences on offer, only Punjab attracted more than one bid
(See table over page) and all the offers were far beneath the
astronomical fees quoted by the Himachal Futuristic-led consortium
(HFCL-Bezeq) in the first round (See table and APTA September 11,
December 18).

Licences back on the table for a third time will be: Andaman & Nicobar,
Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, North East, Uttar
Pradesh (East) and West Bengal.

Any further progress will in all probability await a decision from the
Supreme Court on the numerous petitions calling for the privatisation
to be re-examined. The court has ruled that basic services licences
will not be issued until all the petitions - of which there are now 10 -
 have been looked into and disposed of.

Following the second round, Tata Tele Service, Basic Tele Service,
Reliance Industries and Techno Telecom India are set to win the 4
licences of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Bihar respectively
as they are the only groups which bid for these circles. Essar Bell
Atlantic should be operating basic services in Punjab where it is ahead
of its only rival, Bharti Telenet, in its offer.

Shyam Telecom and Hughes-Ispat are set to operate services in Rajasthan
and Karnataka as the licensing authority, the Department of
Telecommunications (DOT), accepted that it had been mistaken in
rejecting their bids in the first round (See APTA December 4). Added to
those already allotted, 12 of the total 21 basic services on offer
nationwide have been allocated.

Analysts say there were several reasons behind the poor turn-out in the
second round including the growing controversy over the HFCL-Bezeq
consortia's winning bids and last month's parliamentary uproar over the
handling of the tender (See APTA December 18). But the strongest
negatives were the high reserve prices set by the Department of
Telecommunications for each licence - the fee had not left to much room
for profits - and the extremely tight tender deadline.

A representative of AT&T Birla said the group had decided not to rebid
for Gujarat where it had made an offer which was rejected as being too
low. "After a thorough evaluation of the business case, the J-V
concluded that at present our figures do not come up to the level of
the reserve price determined for Gujarat," he said.

If it were not for the strong business interests of the companies which
made offers in the second round, even the 5 licences where they placed
bids might have had no takers.

The Reliance industrial group has over $8bn worth of power, refinery,
petrochemical and downstream business coming up in Gujarat. The Tata
industrial group and Bell Canada, partners in Tata Tele Service, and
Usha Telecom, the Indian partner in Techno Telecom India, have already
won cellular licences in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar respectively.

Essar is reportedly buying equity in one of the companies selected for
the Punjab cellular licence.

RPG, the local partner in the Basic Tele Service group, is involved in
cellular in Madras - capital of the state of Tamil Nadu where it placed
the only bid for the basic services licence for that state. It showed
its special interest in this licence by offering a fee of roughly 2 and
a half times that over US West-BPL's offer in the first round - an
offer which was $285m over its initial offer for the licence.

Aside from the Tata Tele Service group which offered more than double
the Rs18bn ($520m) it bid in the first round for Andhra Pradesh, fee
offers for the other circles were only marginally above the DOT's fixed
NVP.

Bidders are still baffled at the formula behind the reserve prices set
by the DOT on each licence, and the Department has still not disclosed
how it came up with the figures. The reserve price for the Gujarat for
instance is much less than that for the relatively less prosperous
states of West Bengal and Kerala.

Meanwhile, Bharti Telecom is the first of many aggrieved bidding groups
to turn to the courts. The J-V has submitted a petition to the high
court which says it should have won the licence for Punjab.

Sunil Mittal, Bharti Telecom chairman, said the situation was
"ridiculous". The company had offered a quote over 2 times the figure
deemed as a reasonable levy by the DOT when it bid in the first round,
but still was not allocated a licence.

Tata Tele Service has also now turned to the courts to resolve its
dispute over the DOT's decision to allocate the Maharashtra licence to
the Hughes-Ispat group. Though Hughes-Ispat offered $674m over the Tata
Tele Service bid, the latter was told it had won overall "on points" -
there are a number of additional criteria which are included in the
evaluation process. However, higher authorities then decided to reject
this decision made by the Tender Evaluation Committee and to award the
licence to the highest bidder - the Hughes-Ispat alliance - instead.

Alongside these 2 new cases, India's Telecoms Industry and Services
Association (TISA), which lobbies on behalf of local telecoms
interests, has turned to the court to block the DOT's decision to
charge the first instalment of the licence fee before the operators
begin service.

INDIA: CRACKS APPEAR IN CELLULAR J-VS

Cracks have appeared in 3 of the J-Vs selected to operate cellular
services in India last month over disputes which are certain to end in
partnership changes.

Differences have emerged between partners in the Koshika Telecom,
Modicom Network and HHS Communications J-Vs over recent weeks.

Pilipino Telephone Corp. (Piltel), foreign player in the Koshika
Telecom J-V, has been pitted against majority partner, Usha India Ltd.
(UIL) in a highly-publicised disagreement over its equity stake (See
story page 9) while Modi Wellvest, majority partner in the Modicom
Network alliance, appears to be in a terminal dispute with its US
foreign partner Vanguard. Singapore Telecom is seeking a way to back
out of Hinduja HCL Singtel (HHS Communications).

Problems at Modicom Network, the Indian-US-Thai alliance which holds
licences for the 2 areas of Punjab and Karnataka, appear to hinge on a
dispute over how much equity capital the foreign partner should tip in.

Vanguard says it agreed to invest $13m of the $50m equity required for
the $100m project (to be funded on a 1:1 debt-equity ratio) for a 26
per cent stake. But the Modis claim that project costs have now risen
to $250m and Vanguard must pump in more funds if it wants to keep a
grip on its 26 per cent stake.

Vince Snowden, Vanguard's representative in India, said the company was
not willing to give more than agreed in the original shareholders
agreement and had no intention of giving its permission for a change of
partnership. "Modicom used our networth and experience as keys to
secure the licences and now after getting them, they want to bring in
new players at our expense," he said.

Last month, Modi Wellvest approached the DOT saying it wanted to
replace Vanguard with Telstra - Modis' partner in cellular services in
Calcutta. But Telstra replied in a statement that not only had it "not
made any commitment to anyone or any consortium to buy in or join the
consortium" but that "Telstra is not contemplating participation in the
Modicom consortium."

Modi then said that Motorola and Lazard Brothers Asia were planning to
join it with 20 per cent and 29 per cent equity respectively, but
Chicago-based Bob Young, vice president, Motorola Network Ventures
Division said Motorola had been approached by a number of cellular
operators to invest in their ventures, "but nothing has been finalised
as yet."

This tangle has remained unresolved despite intervention last week by
Telecom Commission chairman R K Takkar. Modi Wellvest holds 51 per cent
of Modicom Network and the 23 per cent balance is held by Thailand's
Telecom International.

Meanwhile, Singapore Telecom is reportedly seeking to withdraw from the
HHS Communications J-V - licensed to operate in Tamil Nadu - as it is
not keen on participating in a single licence zone. To take on the
licence, the J-V is required to up its original offer by $84m to match
the fee offered by the highest bidder in that state (US West-BPL
Cellular which offered $238m). Ashok Leyland and HCL are the other
Indian partners in the venture.

So far, the DOT appears to be taking a lenient view of the possible
partnerships changes emphasising it wants to see services kick-started
as soon as possible.

Takkar says the DOT will not interfere if the changes fall within
Company Law and Foreign Investment Promotion Board guidelines and new
foreign partners are financially qualified and have necessary service
operation expertise. Government has the right to vet ownership changes
in the first 3 years under the contract agreements, but appears not to
wish to get involved.

The DOT has also been forgiving in allowing consortia to take longer in
paying the first instalment of the licence fees required - the tender
conditions are very specific in saying that if the licence fee is not
paid by the date due, the next highest bidder will be given the chance
to step in. Takkar said however: "The offers won't be cancelled unless
we are convinced that the parties are not serious." He noted that
companies are having to pay a heavy penalty in interest payments on the
amounts they owe and would not bear the burden if they weren't serious.

So far, 28 licences of the 33 selected are set to operate services in
their licence areas having deposited the first instalment of the
licence fee and signed the licences (See APTA December 18). The licence
fees are to be paid in 10 annual instalments.

Koshika Telecom, Modicom Network and HHS Communications have still to
make the first payment (due to their internal disputes) as have Aircel
Digilink and Hexacom India for their Rajhasthan licences. These last 2
groups have sought an extension until month-end following a dispute
with the DOT over whether they should match the highest offer for the
circle quoted by the Modicom group. Modicom was only permitted to take
up 2 cellular licences due to the tender's networth restrictions and
opted to drop the Rajasthan licence after it placed winning bids in 3
circles (See APTA December 18).

The second Karnataka licence has gone to J T Mobile. J T Mobile had
made an identical offer to AT&T Birla for the licence and the DOT broke
the tie by a draw of lots.

JAPAN: NEW MINISTER VOICES 'SERIOUS' RESERVATIONS ON NTT BREAK-UP

The break-up of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) which has
been at the centre of debate in the Japanese telecoms sector over the
past few months has taken a new direction under Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's cabinet.

Hashimoto, who became Japan's leader on January 11 appointed Ichiro
Hino to the "sensitive" position of Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications and within a few days of taking office, Hino stated
that he has serious reservations about the idea of breaking up NTT into
a few companies.

Hino noted that the ultimate decision will be a political one that will
take into consideration the views of all 3 ruling coalition parties -
Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party of
Japan (that of ex-prime minister Tomichii Murayama), and the New Party
Sakigake. Hino has also said that many politicians acknowledge that NTT
is striving to restructure its organisation so as to boost its
efficiency - some have argued this negates the necessity for its
breakup.

Serioku Kajiyama, the new chief cabinet secretary (the official
spokesman for the government) added that it is probable that there will
be no quick decision on the proposal to divide up NTT. Such a decision
would be likely to be made in the next fiscal year, according to
Kajiyama. The principal concerns were how Japan can remain competitive
with other advanced nations in the telecoms arena and how a possible
break-up of NTT would affect the country's international
competitiveness, Kajiyama said. He implied that to divide up NTT would
mean scattering the resources of Japan's sole telecoms company capable
of competing in the global arena.

Japanese newspapers have widely reported that Prime Minister, Hashimoto
opposes the idea of an NTT breakup. Furthermore, with elections coming
up in the not-too-distant future, major politicians like Hashimoto seek
to avoid alienating NTT's labour unions - which will mobilise tens of
thousands of votes.

The Telecommunications Council, an independent advisory body, is slated
to submit a report to the government in late February that is likely to
advocate a division of NTT so as to spur domestic competition. However,
the new Hashimoto cabinet appears to be more concerned about Japan's
status vis-a-vis international telecoms competition and especially in
nurturing Japan's technical capabilities in the sector.

Hashimoto's position largely opposes the idea of dividing NTT on the
basis that it would damage NTT's research efforts as well as its
potential to "compete" with international heavyweights such as AT&T,
MCI and British Telecom.

NTT - Japan's "flag carrier" - is currently limited to the domestic
market, but the new government's rationale could indicate that it may
be allowed to compete internationally sooner than might have been
expected.

PHILIPPINES: PILTEL THREATENS TO WITHDRAW FROM INDIAN J-V

Philipino Telephone Corp. (Piltel) has threatened to withdraw from a J-
V with Usha India Ltd. after disagreements over how the partnership
would be divided.

The Philippines' leading mobile-phone provider and Usha have resumed
negotiations to head off a collapse of Koshika Telecom Ltd., which won
licences to operate cellular telephone service in 3 areas of India.

Both sides have expressed confidence that deal can be worked out that
will allow Piltel a larger stake. In the meantime, a New Delhi court
has issued a restraining order blocking Piltel's withdrawal.

Piltel notified Usha that it intended to drop out of the partnership
after the Indian company refused a request for a larger stake. Under
preliminary agreement, Piltel was granted a 10 per cent equity interest
in Koshika with an option to increase to 34 per cent.

Usha has balked at allowing the increase, saying Piltel failed to
exercise its options before the bidding for the cellular licence was
issued late last year. Usha holds 85 per cent of shares in Koshika with
the balance of 5 per cent in the hands of a US-resident individual,
Chirinjeev Kathuria. "We are still in the process of negotiations,"
said Joseph Santiago, head of Piltel's legal department. "We just want
them to stick to the original agreement."

Santiago sent a team of negotiators to Manila to try to hammer out the
ownership disagreements with out success. Another round of talks was
scheduled in January. The court has instructed Piltel not to withdraw
or dilute its shareholding below 10 per cent until the case is disposed
of. The next court hearing is fixed for March 27.

Analysts said Piltel's threat to quit Koshika was nothing more than a
negotiation ploy to force Usha to increase the Philippine company's
equity stake. Without Piltel, the J-V could be in jeopardy along with
the cellular phone licences.

"Piltel wants to increase their participation to the point where they
are the managing partner," said Wilfred Son Keng Po, vice president at
Worldsec International Ltd. in Manila. "Usha wants a silent partner."

Vineet Rai, senior vice-president of Usha said Piltel had realised the
real worth of the project after the licences had been issued. "We will
not succumb to arm-twisting by our foreign partner," he said, "and by
obtaining an injunction we are further securing our position."

Ajay Chaudhury, Koshika Telecom chief executive added that the first
stage of the project would be completed by April 2 "with or without
Piltel". Piltel refused to send its technical staff for the project
unless it was allowed the additional equity, but Koshika brought in
Telecom Finland subsidiary, Telecon, to assist.

When the partnership with Usha was announced, Piltel officials said it
was a step toward taking the cellular company regional by providing
expertise in designing cellular networks in developing countries.

Piltel is the largest cellular phone operator in the Philippines with a
subscriber base that is forecast to reach 195,000 subscribers by year-
end. The country's population is about 65m.

Koshika's 3 service areas cover 260m people in Orissa, Uttar Pradesh
West and Uttar Pradesh East. That is a potentially lucrative source of
additional revenue, particularly when Piltel faces growing competition
at home.

Santiago said the experience in India hadn't soured Piltel on becoming
a partner in other companies in the region. "We are still trying to
look into being partners in other countries in the region," Santiago
said. "We have to learn from our experience in India."

Ramon Cojuangco, Piltel chairman, said 2 countries near India had
approached the company about cellular contracts.

PHILIPPINES: PLDT MAKES FIRST STAFF CUTS

For the first time in the company's long history, Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Corp. (PLDT) is eliminating jobs to increase
efficiency and trim excessive costs.

PLDT said it will eliminate 661 jobs - or 2.3 per cent of the total
workforce - thorough lay-offs or early retirements. The cuts are the
first phase of a retrenchment programme that could reduce PLDT's
workforce by 10 per cent.

"This is a significant change in the company's culture," said Ricardo
Tan, assistant vice president for investor relations. "We've never done
this in the 7 decades of our existence."

The departing employees include 35 executives, 243 managers and 383
workers. The company did not say how much it will spend for early
retirement or how much the long-term payroll savings will be.

PLDT is among the region's most inefficient telcos with about 48 lines
per employee, compared with 196 for Hongkong Telecom and 97 for Telekom
Malaysia, according to CS First Boston. Total salaries and wages in
1994 were Ps4.03bn ($153.8m), or nearly 29 per cent of the company's
overall expenses.

The lay-offs come as the 67 year old company undergoes an unprecedented
expansion to try to meet growing demand for communications. Between
1993 and 2001, PLDT plans to add almost 3m lines to its current network
of about 1.5m. It also plans to make its network all-digital to offer
new network services such as call-waiting and conference calls.

PLDT officials said many of those leaving are personnel familiar with
old equipment that the company is phasing out. "Some, rather than go
through retraining, would rather retire and take the golden handshake,"
Tan said.

"The programme will immediately cause some huge cash outlay, but the
medium- and long-term cost savings are enough to offset any initial
expense," said Conrad Andres, research director at DVP-Daiwa Securities
Philippines Inc.

PLDT, a former monopoly, now faces at least 8 companies in the
lucrative market for international calls. Some 60 per cent of its
revenue comes from overseas calls. Since December 1, it has had a
policy of not hiring new personnel.

SRI LANKA: SRI LANKA PRESSES AHEAD WITH TELECOMS PRIVATISATION

Sri Lanka has announced plans to press ahead with the privatisation of
the state-owned telephone company, Sri Lanka Telecom, within 6 months
despite widespread protests from trade unions.

Telecoms Minister Mangala Samaraweera said Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) was
unable to meet the explosive demand for phones in the country and
desperately needed fresh capital to expand its services. "Privatisation
of Sri Lanka Telecom is non-negotiable," the minister said adding that
trade unions were resisting because they were not fully aware of the
process.

Earlier this month, the government awarded the restructuring of SLT to
a consortium comprising investment bankers Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon, accounting firm Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu International and law firm Slaughter and May.

The minister said SLT together with 2 private operators with a licence
to provide wireless loop connections will be able to hook up only
400,000 new telephones by 1997 although the demand would be well over
1m. He said SLT was committed to an investment of some Rs20bn ($377m)
in the next 18 months but would find it difficult to raise the capital
unless it was privatised soon.

"We need huge resources to develop telecommunications," Samaraweera
said. "We must understand the realities of the 21st century. We have to
move forward with the new technology and for that we can't get money on
our own."

Privately, however, analysts say the government is desperate to raise
money through the sale of its assets to meet a huge budget deficit
brought about by its ballooning defence expenditure. The ruling
People's Alliance had opposed privatisation when it was in opposition,
but was forced to resort to do it to bridge the budget deficit of
Rs87.5bn (1.65bn dollars) in 1996.

The government hopes to raise Rs21bn ($396.22m) from the sale of state
enterprises during 1996. The Sri Lanka Telecom sale along with the
national airline AirLanka are expected to raise most of that revenue.
Both will be up for grabs by the middle of the year. Sri Lanka Telecom
had a turnover of Rs5,000m (94.33m dollars) in the year ending
September 1995.

Telecommunication trade unions say that retrenchment will be inevitable
as private management's take over SLT, which currently employs some
7,500 workers. The number of direct exchange lines operated by SLT is
200,000.

The World Bank has been asking Sri Lanka Telecom to reduce its staff
but officials said they were only prepared to reduce the worker/phone
ratio by increasing the number of phones. However, there was no money
for that.

The trade unions argue that tariffs will rise sharply following
privatisation. The SLT currently charges Rs13,000 ($245) for a new
phone connection although the actual cost is estimated at Rs106,000
($2,000).

"Privatisation is a curse," said J. B. P. Dissanayake, the president of
the Joint Organisation of Telecommunication Unions (JOTTU). "We all
must oppose it," he added.

SRI LANKA: GREEN LIGHT FOR FOREIGN WIRELESS LOOP VENTURES

Sri Lanka has given the green light to 2 foreign consortiums to set up
private telephone networks across the country using wireless loop
technology.

Secretary to the ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, K. C.
Logeswaran said the cabinet had accepted proposals by Bell Canada and
Telia of Sweden to set up networks with 100,000 lines each within 3
years. "They will have 3 weeks to incorporate companies locally to
undertake the work," Logeswaran said. "Thereafter, they will be issued
licences to (formally) operate parallel networks in competition with
(state-owned) Sri Lanka Telecom."

The 2 consortiums will have to pay a once-and-for-all fee of Rs300m
($5.66m) each for the licence but they will be free to determine their
tariffs.

"We got the initial proposals on June 30 and within 41 days we were
able to go through the technical evaluation process and obtain cabinet
approval for the 2 private networks," Logeswaran said.

Logeswaran said each of the 2 private operators - who will compete
against each other as well - was expected to provide at least 40,000
phone connections in the first year of operation and go up to 100,000
lines within 3 years.

There are some 220,000 potential telephone subscribers in the queue,
some which have been waiting for nearly 10 years for a phone connection
from Sri Lanka Telecom. However, the government estimates that the
actual demand is about 1m.

The two private operators will provide "wireless loop" phone
connections - eliminating the need for costly land lines - connecting
into Sri Lanka Telecom's backbone network to access international
circuits and other phone users in the country.

Long delays in obtaining fixed line phones in Sri Lanka have boosted
the sales of cellular phone operators in the past 6 years. The number
of mobile subscribers is estimated at 55,000.

TAIWAN: CONTROVERSIAL BILLS SHOULD BE PASSED BY MONTH-END

The long anticipated reading of Taiwan's 3 Telecom bills - which could
allow up to one third foreign ownership in telecoms J-Vs and offer up a
raft of new mobile licences - passed 2 readings in the Legislative Yuan
(LY) earlier this month despite persistent protest by telecoms
employees.

Industry observers said the bills are expected to become law by the end
of the month when the terms and conditions for potential operators will
be announced and a review committee formed to examine potential
bidders. The fact that the controversial bills had passed the first 2
readings showed a government commitment to bulldozing the proposals
through the legislature - despite outcries by the national operator's
employees, they said. Delays which have extended month after month
would soon be over; bills that pass the third and final reading become
law.

At a press conference, Liu Chao-shiuan, Minister of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC), last month avowed that privatisation "will
happen" and was "inevitable". Since then, the government has repeatedly
stressed that the privatisation of the Directorate General of
Telecommunications (DGT) forms the backbone of its Asia Pacific
Regional Operations Centre (APROC) plan - the high-profile scheme which
calls for Taiwan to become a regional hub for multinational
corporations and international telecoms traffic.

Meanwhile, however, several thousand DGT employees have continued to
protest outside the LY during the many review sessions being held by
its Telecommunication Committee since late December. They are
protesting that privatisation and liberalisation will see the new China
Telecommunication Co. - a spin-off of DGT proposed under one of the
bills - become an uncompetitive state-owned operator which will be
forced to rationalise, resulting in huge lay-offs.

Union members also threatened to shut off telephone switching systems
that operate public telephones and to destroy telecoms equipment, but
the DGT has countered that any employee found attempting to do so,
would be dismissed. High ranking MOTC officials have asked union
members to take a hard look at "the problems" facing Taiwan's telecoms
industry."

One of "the problems" they feel is the inability of existing
infrastructure to service the needs of large corporations that rely
heavily on the network - the kind of corporations that the APROC policy
is seeking to attract.

Acer Sertek Inc. - Taiwan's largest computer manufacturing company -
dragged this issue centre stage earlier this month when it threatened
to move its international telecoms centre to Hong Kong or Hawaii. Acer
plans to call in a telecoms company, such as AT&T or MCI, to help set
up an international network for them.

The announcement shook several government agencies, prompting the high
ranking Council for Economic and Development to say the group's plans
to move should be taken "as a warning to the country."

Top officials have been quoted in local papers as saying that unless
the 3 bills are passed by the legislature, the lack of a strong
telecoms infrastructure will be detrimental to the island's ambitions
as a regional operations centre.

The pro-liberalisation lobby would appear unstoppable. Minister Liu
said that he and other ministry officials would mobilise legislators to
pass the bills including amendments that call for the lucrative paging
and cellular sectors to be cracked open (See story below).

Several computer associations have also been collecting signatures to
show their support for the passing of the bills.

TAIWAN: TAIWAN PLANS TO OFFER 8 NEW GSM AND PCS LICENCES

Taiwan looks set to offer a total 8 new cellular licences to would-be
operators following a public meeting held last month which looked into
plans to liberalise the sector.

Following the meeting, chaired by Mao Chi-kuo, Vice Minister of the
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) it was decided that at
least 3 regional GSM licences (covering north, central and south
Taiwan) and 3 regional PCS licences as well as 2 island-wide PCS
licences should be offered to new operators. Revised proposals are
awaiting approval by the Legislative Yuan (See story above).

Other parties at last month's meeting included representatives from
APROC Window (the group that advised the MOTC to liberalise), high
ranking officials from the national operator, the Directorate General
of Telecommunications (DGT) and private companies vying for licences.

The number of new licences on the table has come as a surprise to many
observers.

Taipei-based David Hoffman, Technology Practice Director at Coopers and
Lybrand, told APTA that while competition would be healthy for Taiwan,
he believed the introduction of so many licences at one time would make
it difficult for consumers to differentiate between the products and
services on offer and for operators to get a head start. He added that
the nature of the licences may not be "entirely fair" to operators: "It
depends on who wins the licences, whether they are also able to work
together," he said. "Taiwan does not have a strong regulator to oversee
that interconnections are easily made.

If the DGT is involved in the process, it would be in their own
interest to make it as difficult as possible for their competition to
enter the market."

The bills propose an auction method for awarding licences, but this is
coming under fire from local lobby groups. Hoffman agreed: "Auctions
for multiple licenses don't work all that well."

An auction would only encourage collusion and higher pricing because
those who make astronomical bids would be unable to charge more than
the going rates, he said, and recommended a bid-type method of awarding
licenses linked to performance, as was adopted in Hong Kong.

In Hong Kong, operators put down a performance bond, proposed tariff
rates and their plan for network deployment cover range and stated when
they would be up and running. The bidder guarantees to pay a penalty if
it fails to do what it outlined in its proposals. That way, operators
propose their best service, fastest roll out time and are obliged to
come up with their proposed goods on time.

Edmond Tsai, Motorola general manager, told APTA he believed cellular
penetration in Taiwan could reach well over 3m users by 2000 - up to 15
to 20 percent of the 21m population by then.

TROUBLES AT DAYA MITRA - INDONESIAN KSO UNIT - COULD CAUSE DIFFICULTIES

Domestic telecoms provider PT Telkom has launched its remarkable Joint
Operating Scheme (JOS), handing over the running of most of Indonesia's
telecoms infrastructure to private-sector consortia. But with Telkom
Malaysia apparently reconsidering its participation in the scheme,
there is uncertainty about the future of the PT Daya Mitra Malindo
consortium, due to take over the telephone network in Kalimantan this
month.

Telkom president Setyanto Santosa said on 13 January, without giving
details, that there were still difficulties within Daya Mitra.

Daya Mitra has been plagued by unidentified "internal problems" since
shortly after the JOS contracts were signed in October (See APTA
September 25, December 18). The difficulties were earlier thought to
involve a tug-of-war between leading local partner PT Alatief Nusakarya
Corp. and the major foreign partner in the venture, Telkom Malaysia,
regarding control of the project.

In early January Telekom Malaysia, which has a 25 per cent stake in the
consortium, raised the possibility of a withdrawal from the project.
Given that each of the JOS consortia was required to make up-front
payments of tens of millions of dollars any firm replacing the
Malaysian company would presumably "buy it out".

Kalimantan is now the only JOS division that has yet to be handed over
to its selected consortium. Encompassing most of the large island of
Borneo, the territory is the smallest project in the scheme in terms of
both the number of existing lines and the lines to be installed (See
table over page).

Daya Mitra's other members are PT Intidaya Sistelindomitra; Koptuindo
Telecom Malaysia Bhd; TM Communications (UK) Ltd; and American
International Assurance Co. Ltd. Under its contract with Telkom, the
consortium is to lay 237,000 new lines over the next 3 years (See table
previous page).

According to M Furqon I Hanief, executive director of the Indonesian
Telecommunications Society (Mastel), the problems in Daya Mitra is not
one between Telekom Malaysia and Alatief Corp. but is rather,
"something inside Telekom Malaysia".

"If it was a dispute between the partners, Alatief could easily find
another foreign partner," Hanief told APTA. "There are plenty of
Japanese companies which would very much like to participate," he
added.

Alternatively, Hantief speculated, Telkom Malaysia's extended posturing
might be designed to exact changes to Daya Mitra's JOS contract. But he
said he did not know what the desired changes to Daya Mitra's contract
might be. "I have been asking various people about this, but so far I
haven't got any answers," he conceded.

While Daya Mitra is alone among the 5 JOS consortia in holding up its
ascension to the driving seat, Jakarta observers are taking a
sympathetic view of the group's difficulties, obscure as they are.

"It is probably genuine that they are balking at the terms," said
Jakarta-based Robert Adair of GK Goh's Securities. Representatives of
Daya Mitra declined to comment on the problem.

Indonesia's Telkom, which floated 19 per cent of its enlarged share
capital on the New York, London, Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges
in November, has reportedly advised the Jakarta Stock Exchange that
Telkom Malaysia may have to be replaced with another foreign partner.

During their 15-year concession periods, the 5 JOS consortia are
expected to operate and maintain their existing fixed lines in their
respective geographical divisions, as well as laying a total of more
than 2m new lines before the end of March 1999. This expansion is to be
the private sector's contribution to the 5m lines which the government
aims to see laid by the end of its 6th 5-year development plan (April
1994-March 1999).

Telkom is to receive a minimum annual payment from each of the
consortia - in the region of $100m and 30 per cent of their operating
revenues. The existing networks are assumed by the JOS contracts to be
self-financing, while the costs of the new lines are to be borne by the
consortia. As Telkom's Santoso was quoted recently: "Telkom has nothing
to lose."

Greater Jakarta and East Java, Indonesia's 2 largest manufacturing and
commercial centres, will remain in Telkom's hands.

The JOS contracts are said to provide that Telkom may grant further
network-expansion projects to the companies, while the JOS consortia
are to have what is described as "First negotiating rights". Jakarta
based Laksono Widodo of Barings in Jakarta speculated that the Daya
Mitra difficulties involve the number of new lines stipulated in the
contract.

"Probably Telkom Malaysia plans to install more than the number of
lines stated in the contract," he told APTA. "So the local partner
would have to contribute more in terms of investment." Widodo added
that the dispute appears to be between the parties to the consortium -
an increase in the number of lines would presumably entail an amendment
to the contract between Daya Mitra and Indonesia's Telkom.

Any amendment to any of the JOS contracts is bound to be resisted
strenuously by Telkom, not least because of the precedent it would set
for the other 4 consortia. Telkom Malaysia may not be the only
participation company nervous about the profitability of the JOS
scheme, under which the private sector bears virtually all the risks.

"It's quite dangerous ground for Telkom. Others might start asking to
have their contracts amended," said an analyst with an international
firm in Jakarta. "The government wants to avoid any substantial
renegotiation of the KSO (JOS) agreements particularly in view of
future privatisations," the source told APTA.

In the JOS division of Eastern Indonesia, which is comprised of
Sulawesi, Irian Jaya, Maluku and East and West Nusa Tengara, PT Bukaka
Singtel took over the telecoms network on 3 January. Comprised of
Singapore Telecom International and Fadel Muhammad's Bukaka Telekomindo
International, the consortium is to lay 403,000 new lines.

Pramindo Ikat Nusantara, a consortium of PT Astratel Nusantara (59 per
cent); PT Intertel Pratama Media; the cooperative of telecoms ministry
employees; France Cable et Radio (a France Telecom subsidiary), took
over the existing 600,000 lines in Sumatra on 8 January. Astratel is a
subsidiary of Indonesia's publicly-listed Astra International Pramindo
is expected to install 460,000 new lines on the island at an estimated
cost of $570m. Santosa was quoted as saying that his company's minimum
revenue payment from Pramindo would be Rp514bn for this year, a figure
to be paid on top of 30 per cent of operating profits.

Reuters reported in mid-January that Pramindo has mandated Banque
Nationale de Paris, Chase Manhattan Bank Asia, Fuji Bank and Societe
General to arrange a $350m commercial loan facility to finance the
Sumatra project. The credit facility, which is to be offered for
general syndication shortly, will mature in 8 years.

In the JOS division of West Java, the PT Aria West International
consortium took charge of domestic telecoms on 12 January. Aria West is
made up of PT Aritmas Kencana Murni, PT Aria Bahtera Internusa, US West
International and the Asian Infrastructure Fund. Its contract provided
for the installation of 500,000 new lines, more than doubling the size
of the phone network to 985,896 lines by the end of March, 1999. This
will see Sumatra's telephone penetration reach 3.8 as compared with 1.8
at present. Penetration (the ratio of lines per 100 population) stands
at 1.6 lines nationally.

PT Mitra Global Telekomunikasi Indonesia, made up of PT Indosat, Widya
Duta Informindo, Kokarindo, PT Krida Salindo Sentosa, Telstra
(Australia), Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, Itochu, and Sumitomo
took over the JOS division of Central Java and Yogyakarta on 9 January.
The consortium must lay 400,000 new lines. Mitra Global's minimum
annual payment to Telkom will be Rp300m ($130.4m). According to
Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board, the Mitra Global project
represents an investment of $640m.

TELECOM NEW ZEALAND PLANS TO ENTER CABLE TV MARKET

Telecom New Zealand's planned investment in Sky TV New Zealand may be
under threat, but this will not affect its plans to enter the cable TV
market.

Telecom said late last month that the Sky acquisition has been
"parked". It was reacting to a court order obtained by Clear
Communications which prevents it going ahead with a programming centre
agreement with Sky.

Clear is seeking to have the programming content agreement stopped on
the grounds it is anti-competitive (See APTA October 9).

This court offer follows an earlier one relating to Telecom's purchase
of 24.9 per cent of Sky from its major shareholders Bell Atlantic and
Ameritech. This is in limbo until the courts rule definitively on the
bid by Clear and BellSouth New Zealand to have overturned the go-ahead
for the deal from the New Zealand Commerce Commission.

Telecom has already hinted it might eventually not go ahead with that
part of the deal if the value of the investment, and therefore the
price it has to pay, goes up too much in the intervening period.

As the agreement to acquire a financial stake in Sky was also
conditional to reaching a content agreement, the deal is now in
jeopardy on 2 fronts.

On the other, Telecom says, "Clear's spoiling tactics just reinforce
our determination to get on with the business of providing a new
service and offering more choice to more and more people."

GSM NETWORK IN SHANGHAI

China Unicom, fledgeling second network operator, has attracted 10,000
subscribers to its GSM network in Shanghai since it began signing them
up 3 months ago. Its competitor, the dominant Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT), has a total 160,000 subscribers on 2 analogue
and one digital network in the city.

Unicom, which also has mobile services in Beijing, Tianjin and
Guangzhou, plans to extend its GSM networks to 20 more cities by March.
It also aims to launch its preliminary fixed telephone network in
Shanghai in the first quarter of this year.

Peng Pingxuan, general manager of Unicom's Beijing branch, said he was
confident of the company's prospects over the coming year and believed
Unicom's entry to the market meant good news for the sector.

"Since Unicom was established", he said, "the price of mobile phones in
the Beijing market has fallen by 10,000 Yuan." The MPT was trying to
match its services in the digital phone market, he said, and was
spending heavily on advertising to promote its services for the first
time.

Unicom plans to lay a fibre-optic cable network in Beijing and to add
an additional 40 to 50 base stations to its cellular network there.
This would take its capacity to 100,000 connections in Beijing, Peng
said, including 30,000 lines for long distance calls.

TELEKOM MALAYSIA SIGNING EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTS

Telekom Malaysia has followed the example of rival Binariang and
started signing exclusive agreements to provide telecoms services.

Binariang, which last week lofted Malaysia's first telecoms satellite
(See cover story), was the first in the field signing with tenants and
co-investors in the massive Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) project in
the heart of capital. KLCC, the brainchild of Ananda Krishnan (the
controlling shareholder in Binariang), has twin office towers as its
centrepiece that when finished next year will be the world's tallest.

Mohammed Said, Telekom chief executive, said: "We have 20 deals on the
cards, mostly in peninsular Malaysia as well as one in Sarawak".

Typical of the 4 deals is the one signed in January with the property
developer Kemayan Corp., that envisaged an investment of M$1m (US$4.4m)
for designing and installing a fibre-optic based telecoms system in
Rasah Kemanyan, a new township an hour's drive from Kuala Lumpur.

Telekom, as normal, receives its payment in revenue deduction but
benefits because Rasah Kemayan residents will have their lines pre-
installed, thus freezing out the competition. Kemayan gains because
Telekom undertakes installation of the systems and maintains them under
a service contract.

Rickie Tang, chief executive of the listed Kemayan said: "The network
installed in the township will include such advanced facilities as
voice mail, mobile telephones, video conferencing and distance
learning".

PAKISTAN'S NATIONAL OPERATOR OPEN TO BIDDING

Pakistan's national operator will be open to bidding from strategic
investors at the end of the month, when the names of interested parties
will also be revealed.

PTC is now officially an autonomous public limited company following
the passing of a government ordinance late last year.

From January 1, the old PTC was segmented with core operations becoming
the new Pakistan Telecom Co. Ltd. (PTCL) and its previous regulatory
functions stripped out into 2 new bodies: the Frequency Allocation
Board (FAB) responsible for frequency planning and allocation, and the
Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) becoming the new regulator and
administrative body.

The National Telecom Corp. (NTC) also bourne from the old PTC will look
after government and military telephones.

The entire privatisation process is expected to be completed by March
when PTCL will see a change in management. The present chairman of PTC,
Mian Javed, will however, be the chief executive of PTCL.

The terms and conditions of the employees will remain the same and any
further changes will be made in consultation with the regulator (PTA).

BUKAKA SINGTEL SHORTLISTS 3 SUPPLIERS

Bukaka Singtel has already shortlisted 3 suppliers for its J-V with
Telkom which calls for a minimum of 403,000 new telephone lines to be
installed under a 15-year concession.

The J-V is anticipated to commence work on the installation process in
April and expects to begin telephone services by the end of 1999.

Bukaka Singtel, 40-per-cent-owned by Singapore Telecom International
and 60-per-cent by PT Bukaka Telekomindo International, is one of 5
groups licensed to install and operate lines all over Indonesia under
revenue-sharing arrangements with the national operator, PT Telkom (See

KOREA'S FIRST DIGITAL CELLULAR SERVICE

Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT) got Korea's first digital cellular service
off the ground early this month with the launch of its long-awaited
CDMA network in Seoul.

Service is currently available in Incheon and Pucheon - 2 areas in the
west of the capital - and will gradually become available across other
areas as base stations are rolled out.

Analysts are not expecting explosive digital cellular growth until the
price of handsets comes down. The CDMA handsets offered by KMT are
retailing at a little under $1000. Shinsegi Corp., KMT's sole
competitor, has put off its launch until June.

KMT's CDMA network is the second of its kind to be launched worldwide.
Hutchison Telecom launched the world's first in Hong Kong last
September.

NTT APPLIES TO REDUCE CHARGES ON PERSONAL HANDYPHONE SYSTEM

NTT Central Personal Communications Inc. and its 8 regional group
companies have applied to reduce charges on their personal handyphone
system (PHS) starting February 1.

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) group PHS companies want
to cut their basic weekday short-distance rates to be more competitive
with the PHS firms in the DDI Inc. group (led by DDI Tokyo Pocket
Telephone Inc.) and the Astel group (led by Astel Tokyo Corp.).

The NTT PHS companies also want to reduce their new subscription charge
from 4,200 yen to 3,000 yen.

There were a total 620,000 PHS subscribers in Japan at the end of 1995.
Uptake of the service, which was launched in mid-1995, is developing
much slower than originally forecasts. The DDI group had just over
250,000 PHS subscribers at the end of 1995, and its projection for this
calendar year had been cut.

JAPANESE CELLULAR SUBSCRIBERS

Japanese cellular subscribers more than doubled in 1995, reaching
8.05m, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun. Subscriptions in calendar
1995 reached 4.68.

Market leader NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc, (NTT DoCoMo) - a
subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. - had a total of
3.93m customers at the end of the year, but its market share fell to
48.8 per cent from 54.4 per cent at the end of 1994. This was the first
time that NTT DoCoMo's share has fallen below 50 per cent.

Second-ranking DDI Corp., had 1.62m customers, followed by 3 other
cellular phone operators.

Subscriptions are continuing to rise at a brisk pace, with December
setting a record of 572,700 new digital and analogue cellular
customers.

The 1995 introduction of the micro-cellular personal handyphone system
(PHS) business, featuring less expensive calls, had not hurt the
standard cellular business, which is expected to grow by at least 1m
new customers every 2 months in 1996, the paper said.

SINGAPORE'S GROWTH IN BUSINESS SPENDING

Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) says the island-nation's
communications and IT industry will chalk up double digit growth in
business spending in 1996 after seeing a 77 per cent rise to S$264.9m
last year.

Broadcasting and TV production was the star performer of 1995, with a
remarkable 375 per cent increase in spending to S$160m, but telecoms
and on-line services also saw impressive growth with business spending
rising to S$67.3m - a jump of over 32 per cent on the previous year.

Multimedia and IT services which comprise the rest of sector posted
committed business spending of S$37.2m last year.

NTT WANTS TO REDUCE LONG-DISTANCE CALL CHARGES

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) wants to reduce its long-distance
call charges from next month but is awaiting a green light from the
regulator, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.

If the Ministry gives the go-ahead, other common carriers like DDI
Corp., Teleway Japan Corp., and Japan Telecom Co., are expected to
follow suit.

NTT charges Y180 for a 3 minute daytime call made during a weekday for
distances over 160km. It hopes to cut the rate to between Y140 to Y150
for the base 3 minute long-distance call. A formal decision on the
exact level of the cut are expected by the end of the month (January).

NTT's 3 main competitors charge Y170 for their base 3 minute long-
distance calls and are expected to reduce their rates to approximately
Y10 yen under the new NTT long-distance rates. The pricing must be
slightly lower than that of NTT for them to remain competitive.

NTT last reduced its base 3 minute long-distance charge by Y20 in
October 1993, from a previous rate of Y200 for a 3 minute call.

SPEECHTEK DEVLOPERS CONFERENCE DRAWS MORE THAN 700 ATTENDEES

Speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis, two emerging
technologies now-bringing "killer applications" to market as
they change the way humans and machines interact, were the
focal points of the SpeechTEK 95 Developers Conference held in
Boston recently.

The goal of most speech technology is to create completely
natural interfaces between people and the machines they use,
replacing cumbersome keyboards, awkward telephone keypads and
making a wide range of consumer products easier to use. One
example, Wildfire, screens, routes and announces incoming
calls for mobile professionals. Other applications include
voice dialing for cellular car phones, allowing drivers to
keep both hands on the wheel.

Attendees at SpeechTEK 95 had a chance to explore the world
of advanced speech technology by viewing live demonstrations
of existing products; hearing presentations from senior
executives of leading speech recognition companies and
attending issue-orientated workshops.

Peter J. Foster, president and CEO of Voice Control Systems,
informed the crowd that after a decade that featured market
research projections of a billion dollar market, speech
technology has now begun to develop "killer applications."
Alan G. O'Dacre, assistant vice president for business line
management and engineering at Nortel showed how the public
telephone network has been transformed by the use of voice
technologies and how they will become dramatically easier ill
the near future. Walt Tetschner, president of Tern Systems and
a renown industry consultant, predicted that the various
market segments of speech technology would enjoy strong growth
in the near future, with most seeing 20% and 30% growth rates
through 1998. John Oberteuffer, publisher of ASR News, an
industry newsletter, moderated a panel which updated attendees
on efforts to develop API (Application Programming Interface)
standards.

Another sign of industry growth was the recent launch of
Speech Technology magazine, the first publication devoted
entirely to applied speech technology. This year's conference,
SpeechTEK '96, is scheduled for Sept. 30 through Oct. 2 in
New York.

Comtek International, Inc. which produced and managed
SpeechTEK, is a company that produces about 20 trade shows a
year, many in the former Soviet Union.  Founded in 1990, the
firm employs about 50 people at its headquarters, 43 Danbury
Rd., Wilton, CT 06897.

SPEECH TECHNOLOGY MAGAZINE PUBLISHES FIRST EDITION

Speech Technology magazine, the first publication devoted
solely to the rapidly emerging technologies that are changing
how machines and humans interact, published its first edition
recently.

The magazine examines how speech recognition software, once
thought to be only the stuff of science fiction movies, is
available here and now, and for uses far beyond the computer.
"Very soon, we will be talking to our cars and television
sets, and they will be talking back," said Brian Lewis, editor
of the quarterly publication. readers are the users and
evaluators of this technology -- the next wave of innovators
who are putting this exciting technology to practical use.
They are the people defining an industry that will shape the
way the world works and plays," he added. The magazine was
first available at SpeechTEK '95, a conference for speech
technology developers held in Boston.

The premier edition featured articles on a variety of speech
recognition issues. The articles included how speech should
become the natural interface for public telephone network
services, the advent of "no hands" dialing for cellular car
phones and the speech recognition problems caused by different
dialects. The magazine also featured detailed market forecasts
for the various segments of the automatic speech recognition
and text-to-speech markets and a review of the factors
involved in the development of API (application program
interface) standards.

Filling an Industry Void

Despite the fact that voice recognition and speech synthesis
have become hot industry topics for many business and
technical publications, users have long had to glean
information from publications that had only a casual interest
in the topic. "Speech Technology fills a long standing void in
the industry," said Lewis. "We were surprised to find that no
other national publication focused on speech. The timing, the
technology and the market conditions all seemed right to
launch the magazine at this time."

CI Publishing is a division of Comtek International, Inc.,
which produced and managed SpeechTEK.

Carriers

Open Development Corporation, of Westwood, MA, developers and
marketers of software and services to telecommunications
companies, has introduced openMEDIA Prepaid, a network-based
prepaid calling card system designed to handle over 100
million accounts and support more administrative features than
any other prepaid system in the industry.  openMEDIA Prepaid,
which is marketed to service providers, can easily process 20
million call minutes per month.

openMEDIA Prepaid provides many advanced administrative and
performance features required to provide fast, reliable
prepaid service. These features include fraud control,
multiple reseller and rating plan support, call branding and
activation of cards and lots through IVR (interactive voice
response), as well as the ability to handle large call volumes
associated with millions of accounts. In addition, openMEDIA
Prepaid handles administration, billing and customer care
functions using Windows-based applications.

customers can quickly respond and adapt to new market demands
now and into the future. "

Prepaid phone cards let users make calls easily without a
phone company account, allow the use of pay phones without
coins, and are cost-effective because there are no surcharges
or operator assist charges. For businesses, prepaid phone
cards make it easier to track expenses and can be used as
promotional items and giveaways. Yankee Group analysts expect
prepaid phone cards to represent a $1 billion market by the
end of 1996. "We use Open Development is openMEDIA Prepaid
phone card system for our standard retail offering as well as
our NFL "Let's Talk Football" sweepstakes promotion because it
is the most available, scaleable and reliable system we've
seen to date," said Gordon Allen, president of GTE Card
Services. "The system's database implementation enables us to
easily and efficiently manage account transaction processing
and card distribution," added Allen.

openMEDIA Prepaid is designed to be a reseller platform.  It
offers a hierarchical database of agents, subagents, lots and
cards, making it easy to set up new business partners, create
special promotions and generate hundreds of thousands of cards
in a matter of minutes. In addition, it provides the options
necessary to support one or more resellers. Each reseller, in
turn, can set up a number of prepaid phone card campaigns.

openMEDIA Prepaid is the first application to be fully
integrated on openMEDIA, Open Development's robust, open
client/server-based Enhanced Services Platform (ESP).
openMEDIA is a core foundation from which all applications
can run and share platform resources. The platform is built on
a fully integrated Oracle 7 database, PowerBuilder front-end
applications, IBM RS/6000 or Stratus Continuum processors, a
Summa Four or Excel Switch, Dialogic-based voice response
units and a voice recognition option.

The use of the Oracle 7 Relational Database Management System
(RDBMS) and the Oracle Parallel Server option ensures database
integrity and system scaleability. The platform also offers an
integrated client/server database, a real-time billing and
rating engine, and integrated ACD for customer care, IVR for
service creation environment, and is sold in a fault tolerant

1995 YEAR-END BROADBAND NETWORKING REVIEW

     Upon reviewing the developments in the 1995 broadband networking
market, the differences in terms of market acceptance and technical
development of each broadband technology -- frame relay, switched
multimegabit data service (SMDS), and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
-- are dramatic.  Each networking solution occupies a different
position on the acceptance curve, and carriers and vendors pursued
numerous strategies in 1995 to spur the adoption of the technologies.
     It is not news to BROADBAND NETWORKING NEWS' readers that frame
relay had an incredibly successful 1995.  Carriers increased the
robustness of their networks to meet clamoring demand, pursued a
variety of pricing strategies designed to capture greater market
shares, and offered enhanced frame relay services to satisfy more
sophisticated users.  All three measures reflect the technology's
maturity and mass market acceptance as a wide area networking
solution.

  ...Frame Relay Pricing Approaches

     AT&T, Sprint Corp., and MCI Communications Corp. all unveiled new
frame relay pricing strategies in 1995.  AT&T -- hoping to leverage
what it saw as a trend toward meshed networks and encourage users to
add more network sites -- lowered the price of permanent virtual cir-
cuits (PVCs) by 65 percent to 85 percent and raised its frame relay
port charges by 35 percent to 45 percent (See BNN, April 18, 1995).  
     Sprint pursued a different pricing tactic to attract customers,
offering a very low-cost, zero committed information rate (CIR)
service for users needing no more than four PVCs (See BNN, June 27,
1995).  
     MCI took yet a third track.  The carrier eliminated the mileage
bands that had been associated with its service and offered usage-
based billing, which should prove attractive to low-usage customers
(See BNN, Oct. 3, 1995).  Expect more pricing changes in 1996 as
carriers continue to seek new methods for luring customers to their 
networks and as the FCC has required that all facilities-based
carriers file frame relay tariffs.
     Carriers also increased the robustness of their frame relay
services. In 1995, LDDS Worldcom was the most aggressive of the long
distance carriers at pursing network-to-network interface (NNI) agree-
ments with local and international providers.  Worldcom offers NNI
service in 31 domestic cities via interconnections with all of the
regional holding companies and other local carriers.  Some
international agreements are also in place.  The links allow Worldcom
to extend its network reach and to provide customers with lower cost
local access.
     AT&T unveiled a strong suite of frame relay disaster recovery
options, while Sprint launched a managed frame relay access device
(FRAD) service for Systems Network Architecture (SNA) users.  MCI
sought to expand customer access to its frame relay network by
offering a wide array of remote access options.  (See BNN, Nov. 28,
1995; Oct. 3, 1995; and Nov. 14, 1995)

  ...ATM Infrastructure Buildout

     In the wide area ATM arena, carriers continued building their
initial infrastructures in preparation for expected customer demand. 
LDDS Worldcom, Sprint, Ameritech Corp., GTE Corp., and MFS Datanet
were among those that upgraded their ATM networks in 1995.  ATM also
proved to be a successful carrier backbone solution for transporting
frame relay traffic.
     Although few customers actually are buying native ATM services,
carriers experimented with new service offerings designed to make ATM
easier to use and to tempt customers to test the service.  Sprint
launched low-speed T-1 ATM as well as a frame relay-to-ATM service
interworking offering.  Both services provide a migration strategy for
frame relay users that may need additional capacity in their congested
sites and also offer users a lower-cost option for experimenting with
ATM.  Other carriers are expected to launch similar services.
     Worldcom became the first carrier to offer available bit rate
(ABR) ATM based on StrataCom's early implementation of ABR
capabilities on its BPX switch.  As the ATM Forum's traffic management
specifications solidify in 1996, expect additional vendors and
carriers to roll out products and services based on the much
anticipated ABR spec.
     MFS Datanet took a unique approach to running voice traffic over
its ATM backbone.  Although MFS Datanet's WAVE offering is based on a
proprietary solution that utilizes Nortel's Magellan Passport ATM
switch, the service demonstrates MFS' ability to develop easy-to-use
ATM solutions.  Customers don't have to change their networks, but can
continue using their existing PBX systems and data networking
equipment to transport data and voice traffic over variable bit rate
(VBR) ATM (See BNN, Sept. 5, 1995).
     This ability to make ATM transparent to users will be critical
for attracting customers to the service.  Carriers and vendors that do
this well will have an advantage in 1996, and recognition of this fact
is demonstrated by the surge of interest that developed in the second
half of 1995 for wide area ATM access products. Several vendors
including ADC Kentrox, OnStream Networks, and Premisys  began shipping
or unveiled plans to produce wide area ATM access products.  This
trend is sure to continue in 1996.

  ...Offering End-to-End Solutions

    Another key trend that evolved throughout 1995 in the ATM arena
was the importance of offering customers end-to-end solutions that
encompass both local and wide area networks.  Some vendors, Newbridge
Networks for example, concentrated on developing their own products
that span both the LAN and WAN, while others like FORE Systems and
Nortel pursued partnerships that involved joint product development as
well as co-marketing.  Acquisitions and partnerships are likely to
continue in 1996.  Smaller firms likely will attempt to increase their
market presence by merging with each other, and large companies will
gobble up startups with unique and innovative products.

  ...SMDS, The Sleeper Service

    Although SMDS is not expected to achieve frame relay's popularity,
several developments in 1995 will help spur additional sales.  Many
local carriers rolled out low-speed SMDS, which should prove popular
with firms wanting to add remote sites to the corporate network.  
    The growth of image intensive applications in the printing and
medical communities is expected to continue in 1996, and SMDS has
proven popular in these industries.  Pricing changes by MCI, which
eliminated the service's usage minimums, also should lower the
barriers to entry for companies wanting to move to the new service.  
    The Internet proved a boon to all three broadband technologies in
1995, as companies bought circuits from carriers for access and
vendors sold products to build high-speed Internet backbones.  As
local telcos continue their move into the Internet access business in
1996, vendors and carriers with products and services that perform
well in the Internet environment are expected to prosper.

RACAL GETS BARGAIN BRITISH NETWORK

     Racal Electronics has beaten four or five other would-be buyers
on the Department of Transport's shortlist with a successful bid to
acquire BR Telecommunications (BRT) from the British Railways Board. 
Racal will pay Pounds 132.75 million ($204.5 million) to acquire BRT.
    BRT's business principally consists of providing
telecommunications services to Railtrack and the railway operating
companies.  With some 6,900 miles of trunk cable and 10,000 miles of
branch cables, BRT is the largest telecommunications infrastructure
network operator in the U.K. other than British Telecom, Mercury, and
military establishments. 
    The BRT network provides voice, data, and radio network services;
private circuits; and a range of customer premise equipment.  The
company employs around 2,800 people based at some 180 locations
throughout the U.K.  The business is divided into four operating
sections: 
    *  Networks. Provides and manages fixed and mobile
telecommunications network services.
    *  Carrier Services. Provides dark fiber, management of tele-
communications wayleaves, and management of pay phones and other
property-based assets.
    *  Maintenance. Provides maintenance of equipment and
telecommunications and electronic systems.
    *  Projects and Works. Comprises a project engineering and
installation service for the supply of telecommunications networks,
systems, and equipment.

  ...Competitive Position Strengthened

    BRT will become a separate subsidiary within the Racal Network
Services
group, managed on a fully integrated basis with the other businesses. 
The acquisition is expected to strengthen Racal's competitive position
to provide managed network services and to enhance the prospects for
the Racal Group as a whole.  BRT's fiber-based network will provide
access to extensive telecommunications circuits and telecommunications
wayleaves over Railtrack and British Railways Board property.  The
integration of BRT with other Racal Network Services businesses will
result in cost savings through improved utilization of BRT capacity,
sharing of assets, and avoiding duplication of functions within the
enlarged group.
    Ownership of the BRT network and its capabilities will enhance the
prospect of securing substantial and strategically important
commercial and government contracts.  Racal's existing work force will
be strengthened through the addition of the skilled engineering and
national maintenance staff employed by BRT.
    Commenting on the acquisition, Racal Chairman Sir Ernest Harrison
said, "There is considerable growth potential for BRT in both the rail
community and other related markets within the fast-moving managed
telecommunications sector, where Racal has an outstanding record... 
As the turnkey contractor responsible for the installation and
maintenance of the entire voice and data communications infrastructure
for the Channel tunnel, Racal has particular expertise in the rail
environment, and we believe that the acquisition of BRT will bring
substantial benefits to both parties."
    Racal won the contract to establish the Government Data Network --
which remains one of Europe's largest private data network -- in 1989,
and also manages the communications requirements of a growing number
of major companies. Despite losing out to Mercury to provide managed
communications services for the police and for NatWest Bank, Racal
gained a full telecom license in 1994, and has in excess of 300,000
customers for its voice, data, and messaging services.
    Because BRT is a member (with a 7.7 percent share) of the
pan-European rail communications consortium, which is building an
optical network, there will be opportunities for Racal to expand into
continental Europe as well.  (Contact: Racal, +44 1734 66 99 69)

SPECIFICATION WORK CONTINUES, ATM FORUM CONTEMPLATES GOALS FOR 1996

     With an eye toward sending its work out for final vote at the
February meeting, the traffic management, signaling, and private
network-to-network interface working groups of the ATM Forum addressed
the initial round of straw vote comments received regarding their
respective specifications.  Work on all three documents is progressing
in tandem so that the provisions in each will align.
    George Dobrowski, chairman of the technical committee and director
of broadband switching and signaling for Bell Communications Research,
reported that group members clarified various points in all three
specs.  Regarding the provisions for allowed cell rate, members
decided that ATM switches, rather than network interface cards, would
be responsible for governing allowed cell rates. 
    "By putting the function in the switch, it allows us to eliminate
two quality of service (QOS) parameters, so it simplifies the traffic
management and signaling procedures.  It also reduces the cost of
implementation in the network interface cards," Dobrowski said.  He
added that switches can better bear those implementation costs because
they are spread over more users.

  ...International Interoperability Addressed

    The groups determined that support for the internationally defined
QOS classes (i.e. A,B,C,D) is mandatory, whereas the parameter
approach defined by the ATM Forum will be optional.  However, as
Dobrowski explained, "If you do specify [the parameters] and the
device is able to understand them, then the parameter approach will
take precedence over QOS classes because it gives you more precision." 
He added that the QOS class approach is the only one included in the
international standards and that vendors wanting to sell equipment in
Europe need to use an internationally recognized standard.  "This
addresses the interoperability concerns that people had between
equipment based on ITU standards versus ATM Forum implementations,"
Dobrowski said.
    In the signaling arena, the group solidified negotiation
procedures.  "With the previous release of the signaling spec, if the
connection point couldn't accept your request, you had to start the
connection all over again," Dobrowski explained.  "Now, some
negotiation will be possible.  Users can access or reject or adjust
downward their initial request and go forward with it."   The result
is faster connections, as users won't need to resend certain signaling
messages if network capacity is not available to meet their bandwidth
requirements.
    Other specs out for final ballot include the DS-3 direct mapping
physical layer interface, an addendum to the 155 unshielded twisted
pair (UTP) physical layer interface, the native ATM services semantic
description (or ATM application programming interface), the Protocol
Implementation Conformance Statement (PIC) for UTP 3, and the
conformance abstract test suite for AAL type 5.  A clarifying LAN
emulation addendum also was released.

  ...Reevaluation Underway

    As work nears completion on many critical issues before the ATM
Forum, members are closely examining the role the body will take in
the future.  "We are going through a strategic planning process,
identifying potential work areas or what holes exist in providing end-
to-end ATM connections.  We will go through a debate and voting
process to pick out high priority items," Dobrowski said.  He said
that so far the group has identified 21 potential work areas, and that
in April the technical committee will restructure its working groups
and make new assignments.  Although he wouldn't commit the committee
to any specific areas, Dobrowski noted that, "The item which received
the most attention at the last meeting was wireless ATM.  It's still
early to say, but that seemed to have very broad support and...that is
a candidate for new work."

BT SETS NEW SPEED RECORD FOR FIBER.  

    Scientists and engineers at BT Laboratories, Martlesham, have used
photonic technology to shatter world speed records for broadband
superhighways.  They have designed a new type of telecommunications
network, based entirely on the transmission of laser beams through
optical fiber, using devices that almost completely can eliminate
conventional electronic circuits.
    Key elements for this "supernet of the 21st century" are new
photonic components invented and built at Martlesham.  These include
an optical transistor, which BT claims is capable of processing
information at 80 Gbps, and a high-speed optical switch many times
smaller than existing designs.
    These are the basic building blocks used to construct an
all-optical telephone exchange that can read information from a packet
of data at a rate of 100 Gbps, decode the identity of the intended
recipient, and switch the packet onto its destination path.  BT
anticipates bringing this technology out of the lab during 1996, and
building a working prototype photonic network.  The prototype network
will use the existing optical fiber linking six towns in South East
England to allow the new devices to be tested in real working
conditions.  (Contact: BT Labs, +44 1473 647 448)

ASCOM BUILDS CAMBRIDGE ATM NETWORK.  

    Ascom Timeplex, in cooperation with Switzerland-based research
division Ascom Tech, has designed and built an ATM network for the
Language Center at the University of Cambridge.  The basic ring
operates at 1.25 Gbps across existing dark fiber.  It provides 25 Mbps
ATM to desktop PCs via a broadband solution that includes
transmission, switching, access, servers, and multimedia applications.
    The network, installed as part of a European Commission RACE
project called HIPERNET, is designed to facilitate language learning
through technology and involves equipment and support from IBM,
GEC-Marconi, VTT, AND Software, CAP SESA, and the University of
Cambridge.  While currently only serving seven PCs and a server,
located at five sites spanning a total path of about 15 kilometers,
the project eventually will address the problems of using ATM across a
campus extending 50 kilometers, and a user base of several hundred.

LAN SWITCHING HUB MARKET GROWING: GOOD NEWS FOR CARRIER ATM SALES

     According to a new report by The Insight Research Corp., "The LAN
to WAN Interface: LAN Switching Hubs and the Advance of ATM Networking
1995-2000," the growth in the LAN hub market is an indicator of the
future potential of ATM switch sales and of wide area ATM sales by
carriers.  Insight believes that the growing LAN switching hub market
is good news for the ATM industry because such hubs provide a
migration path to ATM, while still allowing companies to maximize the
use of their legacy systems. 
    "LAN switching hubs are the immediate solution and will provide an
easy migration to ATM switching platforms when their use becomes
widespread toward the end of the decade," said Robert Rosenberg,
president of Insight.
    The research firm predicts that shipments of LAN hubs in the
United States will grow from $4.6 billion in 1995 to $14.9 billion by
the year 2000.  Worldwide hub revenues are targeted to increase from
$6.2 billion to $19.7 billion in 2000 (see box).  In its report,
Insight outlines a variety of strategies that carriers can use to
capture a piece of this growing market.

  ...Technical Cooperation Encouraged 

    Carriers are encouraged to promote close alliances with switch
manufacturers and to freely exchange technical information with
vendors.  "If the switch manufacturer has access to the technical
details of the carrier's network operations, the switch manufacturer
can then design products which work well with the carrier's public
data service," writes Insight.  "The user would be assured of both the
network performance and the compatibility between the carrier's
network and the LAN switch."
    Insight also believes that using wide area ATM to support a LAN
interconnection service offers carriers significant opportunities for
growth.  It recommends that service providers:
    *  Strictly adhere to ATM standards.  Compliance will ensure that
procedures such as congestion control are uniform across both local
and long-distance networks and that interconnection is transparent to
users.
    *  Provide cost-effective ATM service pricing.  The cost of
deploying ATM needs to be justifiable initially for data traffic only.
    *  Use flexible connections.  Provide a simple tariff based on
port bandwidth capacity and avoid the complexities of frame relay
pricing.
    *  Provide competitive differentiation.  Value-added features and
industry-specific applications can help carriers distinguish their
services from pure ATM transport offerings.  
    A complete copy of the report is available from Insight Research
for $3,495.  For more information, call Insight at 201/605-1400.

SNET Applies for Statewide Cable Franchise in Connecticut, Abandons
VDT Approach

     In a rejection of the video dial-tone (VDT) model, Southern
New England Telecommunications Corp. has announced that a new
subsidiary, SNET Personal Vision, Inc., will ask the Connecticut
Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) for a statewide cable
TV franchise.  The 76-channel video offering would compete directly
with incumbent cable TV operators statewide and would offer
"competitively priced" services.

     For example, the company will offer near-video-on-demand at
"much greater frequency" than cable TV pay-per-view offerings in
the state, said Patrice Listfield, President of SNET Personal
Vision.  In addition, she said subscribers will be able to call up
movies from remote controls.  At CTR's deadline, the company was
planning to apply on Jan. 25 for the franchise.

     With the announcement, SNET becomes the latest telephone
company to reject a VDT model.  Ameritech Corp. already has signed
cable franchise agreements in several towns in its service area. 
Regarding SNET, Ms. Listfield said the company will continue its
350-subscriber VDT trial in West Hartford until that area can be
included in its cable operations.  Meanwhile, the company plans to
withdraw all its pending VDT applications at the FCC.  "We just
don't want to keep Connecticut customers waiting," she said.

     Ms. Listfield declined to say whether the company always will
price services at rates below existing cable TV rates, adding, "We
don't aim to [offer service] at higher prices."  She said SNET
Personal Vision will be the first company to bundle local exchange
service and cable TV offerings in the same package.  "We are paving
the way," she said.  "This is unprecedented."

     SNET's plan is unique because it would bypass hundreds of
potentially lengthy franchise negotiations with local governments. 
Connecticut is one of the few states that oversee cable TV
franchises at the state level.  Most states leave that authority to
individual cities.

     SNET Personal Vision will deploy a hybrid fiber optic/coaxial
cable network and hopes for DPUC approval by mid-December, Ms.
Listfield said.  She said no cross-subsidization will occur between
the company's cable and telephone operations, in accordance with
state and federal law.  The SNET Personal Vision subsidiary may use
Southern New England Telephone Co. facilities, but it will pay fees
or rent as would a separate company, she said.  Hoshang Mulla, Vice
President-network planning for SNET, said Personal Vision will
present "a very well thought out and extremely fair and proper
proposal" to the DPUC that guards against cross-subsidization.  

     He added that network upgrades in progress will boost
efficiency so much that the cost of providing telephone service can
recede as the video operations are deployed.  Mr. Mulla also said
new technology will allow the video network to continue operating
during power outages, as occurs with SNET's existing local
telephone service.

     Ms. Listfield declined to discuss possible cross-promotion
activities that could stem from SNET's combined video, local
telephone, and long distance operations, but she predicted tie-ins
between the company's business contacts from its printed directory
division and cable TV advertising sales.  "We certainly look to
capitalize on those relationships," she said.  She added that
Personal Vision will use results of the West Hartford trial to help
facilitate the cable TV deployment.

     The company said it expects its upgraded system to reach 36%
of Connecticut homes and business by the end of 1998, with 64% of
the state completed by the year 2000 and full deployment by 2009. 
That schedule coincides with the $4.5 billion upgrade plan that
SNET announced about two years ago, officials said.  Among
communities where the build-out will be complete by the end of 1998
are Bethel, Bloomfield, Branford, Bristol, Darien, East Haven,
Fairfield, Farmington, Meriden, Milford, New Britain, Norwalk, Old
Greenwich, Stamford, Stratford, Wallingford, West Hartford, and
Westport.  Also by 1998, the system will be partially complete in
Bridgeport (65%), Danbury (89%), Hartford (17%), New Haven (70%),
North Haven (79%), Plymouth (55%), Trumbull (16%), West Haven
(98%), and Weston (92%), Personal Vision said.

     Personal Vision said it expects to deploy the service in
portions of Darien, Fairfield, Norwalk, Stamford, Weston, Westport,
Farmington, New Britain, and West Hartford within "a few months"
from the time it receives regulatory approval.  In addition, SNET
plans to engage in negotiations with NYNEX Corp. in Greenwich, and
Woodbury Telephone Co. in Southbury and Bethlehem, to "develop
arrangements that will allow SNET Personal Vision to offer a cable
alternative in those areas."

AT&T's $137.5 Million Deal with DirecTV Enhances Already Powerful
Cable TV Competitor

     AT&T Corp. has acquired a 2.5% equity interest in direct
broadcast satellite (DBS) provider DirecTV, Inc., for $137.5
million.  The deal gives DirecTV marketing access to AT&T's 90
million customers and bolsters its competitive position against the
cable TV industry.  Under the deal, AT&T has the option to increase
its stake to 30% over the next five years, depending on how many
subscribers it enrolls over an unspecified period.  The deal's
price tag puts AT&T's valuation of DirecTV at $5.5 billion.  The
companies said they expect to start joint marketing by mid-1996.

     AT&T chose an equity investment over less involved partnering
schemes to "put your money where your mouth is, so this isn't just
a marketing game," said Joseph Nacchio, Executive Vice President of
AT&T's consumer-small business division.  He declined to disclose
what specific triggers would allow AT&T to increase its investment
but said there will not be another option until at least 1997.

     The purchase, which was announced Jan. 21, came two days
before AT&T was expected to bid for its own DBS license in the
FCC's auction of the remaining orbital slots at 110 and 148 degrees
West Longitude.  Mr. Nacchio said the company opted to buy into
DirecTV because obtaining its own license was expected to cost more
than $1 billion for bidding and system deployment.  

     He said it would have taken at least two years to get the
service off the ground, time that AT&T did not want to cede to
competitors.  DirecTV, on the other hand, is already established
and would allow AT&T to tap the market now, he said.

     Analysts at Merrill Lynch endorsed AT&T's approach.  They
predicted "no significant impact on earnings" but said AT&T's
equity investment strategy is "a smart and sensible way of entering
the home entertainment business."  In addition, they said the move
may have implications for cable TV companies and "makes it somewhat
more imperative" that MCI Communications Corp. step up its efforts
to bid for a DBS slot.

     In addition, AT&T and DirecTV touted the marketing
possibilities.  DirecTV President Eddy Hartenstein said AT&T will
be an "extremely powerful" outlet to promote DirecTV services and
increase its brand identity.  Mr. Nacchio promised that "a lot of
interesting marketing techniques" will come to light over the next
few months.  Plans include allowing customers to use an AT&T credit
card to finance the purchase of the 18-inch satellite dishes
required to receive DirecTV--at "very attractive" interest rates. 


     Mr. Nacchio said 12 million customers now use the card.  In
addition, AT&T will add a DirecTV sales pitch to its telemarketing
and direct sales efforts, and its retail outlets--first established
for wireless sales--will be used to sell DirecTV as well, Mr.
Nacchio said.  He said AT&T also plans regularly to promote DirecTV
in its billing literature.  

     The cable TV industry could use the deal to enhance its
argument that the FCC's "effective competition" standard--outlined
in the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act--should be changed to reflect alleged market realities, some
cable TV industry lawyers confirmed.  The industry has argued, for
instance, that the 1992 Cable Act's effective competition
definition is arbitrary and bears no relation to economic models.

     Under the current rules, a cable TV operator must prove that
a local competitor is accessible to at least 50% of the operator's
potential customers and that the competitor actually has garnered
at least 15% of the operator's current customer base.  The cable TV
industry has argued that DBS services such as DirecTV meet the 50%
standard because they are national businesses.  It has said
competitive pricing pressures occur substantially before 15% of an
incumbent operator's customers are lost.

     The FCC has signaled that it will waive rate regulation on a
case-by-case basis when the local competitive situation merits. 
Seth Davidson, a cable TV lawyer with the Washington firm of
Fleishman and Walsh, cited Bell Atlantic Corp.'s video dial-tone
activities in Dover Township, N.J., which prompted the Commission
to propose a partial waiver of the rate rules for Adelphia Cable
Communications, Inc., the incumbent cable TV operator there. 
AT&T's investment in DirecTV likely offers "one more fact that
people will point to" when cable TV operators request waivers in
the future, he said.

     A spokesman at the National Cable Television Association
(NCTA) said the AT&T investment does not signify a major milestone
in the effective competition debate, but "it makes the argument
that cable TV is operating in a competitive marketplace."  He said
important factors include the "influx of capital" that DirecTV will
receive from AT&T and the benefits of adding AT&T to its national
branding efforts.  He said, however, that the cable TV industry
remains poised to compete with national and regional entities,
noting the industry's continuing efforts to "cluster" its cable TV
operations into regional hubs capable of matching the scale of new
video competitors.

     Competition from DirecTV primarily affects the expanded basic
tier of cable TV services, Mr. Davidson said.  He noted that many
new DirecTV customers keep the lowest cable tier--often mostly
broadcast channels--in addition to DirecTV, which cannot offer
local broadcast stations.  As a result, the FCC has begun to
realize that "this doesn't have to be all or nothing" and that
expanded-tier deregulation can be an adequate relaxation of the
rate rules, he added.  As for the 15% standard, he said, "You do
respond to competitive pressure short of that threshold."  The
proposed 1995 Telecommunications Act pending in Congress would
relax expanded cable TV tier regulation when there is a telephone
company competitor, but the legislation does not contemplate the
same flexibility when there is a DBS presence, according to the
draft conference report.

     Although the basics of the AT&T-DirecTV deal are set, both
companies said several issues remain unresolved.  Mr. Hartenstein
said details "haven't been worked out" about possible changes in
arrangements with DBS satellite dish manufacturers.  It is also
unclear whether AT&T's newly spun-off equipment division will have
a manufacturing role, Mr. Nacchio said, but "we're considering it." 
Mr. Hartenstein said he expects nine or 10 dish brand names to
surface by mid-summer.  He said DirecTV also has not determined
whether the transaction will lead to changes in the service's
programming lineup or will spur a combined effort with AT&T to
provide interactive and data services.  He said negotiations are
under way regarding an online service venture but declined to give
details.  "We are well aware of the 30 million PC households," he
said.

     Some have speculated that DirecTV might strike a deal with
NBC, Inc., which recently announced a partnership with Microsoft
Corp. to turn its America's Talking cable network into a
combination news channel/online service.  Mr. Hartenstein said
DirecTV has not held "specific discussions" with NBC, but "we most
likely will."

     Cable TV industry sources said the AT&T-DirecTV announcement
will present another competitive hurdle for the industry, which has
expressed concern over DirecTV's ability to garner 1.2 million
customers in only 18 months.  Others said the deal calls into
question the assumption that AT&T eventually will use the cable TV
industry's infrastructure to resell local telephone service.  AT&T
long has criticized the local exchange access charges assessed by
telcos.  Mr. Nacchio said the deal is not expected to affect AT&T's
future relationship with the cable TV industry, which "has to deal
with the future as we have to deal with it."  He argued that AT&T
is still "an attractive partner" for cable TV companies.

     New telecommunications alliances based on one-stop-shopping
business models increasingly may force "competitors and
collaborators" to mingle, said Paul Glist, a cable TV industry
lawyer at Cole, Raywid and Braverman in Washington.  He said the
cable industry always has cited "natural alliances" with long
distance companies (although the two industries have disagreed on
significant provisions in the telecom bill now pending in
Congress).  "What does this [the AT&T-DirecTV deal] mean for the
long-term relationship?" he asked.

     As the telecommunications industry becomes more consolidated,
companies are bound to intertwine in some business areas while
competing in others, Mr. Glist said.  Another cable lawyer said the
AT&T-DirecTV deal suggests that DBS competition is "quite real. . .
[It has] a real competitive impact" and "further bolsters what
we've been saying all along" about DBS as a serious competitive
threat.  DirecTV is a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp., which is
owned by General Motors Corp.

NCTA Revives Customer Service Campaign As Competition from Telcos
Looms

     The National Cable TV Association (NCTA) has revived last
year's "on-time" guarantee program, partly to gain ground against
telephone companies, which are perceived widely as providing better
customer service as they prepare to enter video markets.  An NCTA
spokesman noted "a positive movement in the needle" of public
perception concerning the cable industry's customer service record
since the guarantee was implemented in March 1995.  He admitted,
however, that the cable TV industry still lags behind telcos in the
public's mind.  "If we were ahead, we would not be so committed to
a program like 'The Future Is on Cable,'" the industry's title of
the overall customer service campaign.  Under the program,
participating cable TV operators offer to meet appointment
"windows" or issue a $20 rebate to the customer.

     Although the customer service campaign got off to a
much-publicized start last year and was followed by a flurry of
national advertising, it has fizzled considerably in recent months. 
Not only did every broadcast network except News Corp.'s Fox refuse
to run the ads, citing competitive reasons, but the cable TV
industry has had to focus its efforts on the pending
telecommunications reform legislation.

     NCTA has announced several changes in the campaign--including
a shift from national to local advertising, with more emphasis on
local system branding to counter the greater name recognition of
the Bell companies.  The NCTA spokesman also noted that local
advertising will allow each cable TV operator to customize its
message to a specific local competitive situation.

     Char Beales, President and Chief Operating Officer of Cable &
Telecommunications:  A Marketing Society (CTAM), said during a
recent satellite teleconference that CTAM will send several
marketing and public relations kits to local system operators in
the next few weeks.  Included will be videotapes of short
commercials touting the campaign.  She urged systems to run the
shorts at least three times daily on at least 10 channel slots. 
NCTA President Decker Anstrom said the industry has not yet
conducted a "thorough market study" of its customer service
performance over the last year, but he stressed that "there's no
quick fix" to the service problems of the past.  "We don't expect
to win the whole game in the first year," he said, but the cable TV
industry needs "changes in behavior."  He said that is "the reason
we're going to beat our competition in the months and years ahead."

     John Hendricks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Discovery Communications, Inc., noted that he once chased down a
cable TV maintenance truck in an attempt to receive service.  He
said the industry needs to leave "the truck-chasing days" behind it
as competition develops.

     The NCTA spokesman said that despite the public's different
perception of the cable TV and telephone industries, most telcos
are "looking more toward those kinds of technologies that are
suited to cable-style infrastructures."

     That means the cable TV industry is ahead in terms of network
capabilities, he said.  He maintained that a cable TV company's
hybrid fiber optic/coaxial network can handle up to about 25% of
its users on the network simultaneously, while most current copper
telco lines can handle only 10%.  Although many telcos are
upgrading to fiber facilities, he said, the cable TV industry may
be able to take an early bite out of the telecom market before
telcos are up to speed.

     Mr. Hendricks said one of the first areas that cable TV
operators hope to pry from the telcos is access to online services. 
The industry has spent the last few months touting the faster data
transmission rates of cable modems when compared to current telco
alternatives (CTR, Jan. 12).  He said cable-related Web sites also
can promote local cable systems by giving online users information
about their local cable TV operators based on the users' zip codes.

Cable TV Companies Embrace Use of ATM Technology, but Not to the
Home

By Judith Freeman Mills

     About two years ago, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) was a
new technology, far from being well-known, standardized, or cheap. 
Today some major cable TV system operators are deploying ATM
switches, championing a technology developed to move vast amounts
of digital data, video, and voice communications simultaneously and
at extremely high speeds.  ATM networks can route and switch
information over a large geographic area, unlike other available
systems.

     Continental Cablevision, Inc., and Time Warner Cable have
concluded from their own experiences with ATM networks that for the
foreseeable future, ATM is the preferred, cost-effective technology
for building the backbone of a broadband digital communications
network.  But they also have concluded that ATM networks are not
the preferable connections to homes.

     Key to their conclusion is the belief that one-way video
channels, such as Cable News Network or pay-per-view offerings,
will continue to dominate consumer television.  This view also
affects their ideas about set-top boxes.  

     They believe that set-top units should be built first to
handle MPEG-II (Motion Picture Experts Group) digital video and
later adapted to handle interactive services, not the other (more
expensive) way around.

     Officials at Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs),
the cable TV industry's research and development arm based in
Louisville, Colo., are tracking the development of ATM technology
closely.  They continue to question when it will be fully developed
and economically sensible.

     Time Warner has 4,000 households on its state-of-the-art Full
Service Network in Orlando, Fla.  The FSN was built as a laboratory
to test services that could be available on a broadband network: 
one-way video, impulse pay-per-view programming, home shopping and
banking, computer data transmission and Internet access, video
conferencing, distance education, and local and long distance
telephone services.  The system also features ATM switching all the
way to the home.

     Based on what Time Warner has learned, the company will not
repeat the architecture, says Michael Adams, Time Warner Cable's
Senior ATM Project Engineer.  Instead, he advocates the use of ATM
technology from the headend (or "network operations center") out,
but not into residential neighborhoods as MPEG-format streams on a
now-standard hybrid fiber optic/coaxial cable network.  ATM
technology would be used only for the so-called backbone.  Mr.
Adams prefers the following architecture:

     Interactive video service providers transmit their programming
to a network operator, where it is stored on media servers or
massive computer storage banks (media servers also store movies and
other pay-per-view fare).  When needed, the programming is moved
onto the operator's core ATM switched network.

     From there the interactive digital programming enters an
Interactive Cable Gateway (ICG), the outer or ending edge of the
ATM backbone where the ATM signals are converted to an MPEG-II
format.  Separately, one-way satellite-delivered digital video
channels (such as CNN or the Discovery Channel) arrive at the
operator's headend and are sent to a Broadcast Cable Gateway. 
These signals would be in MPEG format.

     Both gateways feed into the hybrid fiber/coax network, which
then sends the transmissions into neighborhoods, through
neighborhood optical nodes, and into subscriber homes.  Under this
scenario, transmissions outside the ATM backbone network would be
in the MPEG-II format--a digital format that is becoming standard
for compression and transmission of digital video signals.  The
home set-top box would be MPEG-II; operators would not need to pay
for set-top boxes that also are capable of reading ATM streams.

     Regarding the actual architecture of the Time Warner FSN, each
interactive service provider's programming is stored on media
servers.  From the server the programming enters the system's core
ATM network and goes through an Interactive Cable Bridge (ICB),
remaining in an ATM format.  Meanwhile, satellite-delivered video
channels enter the system's Broadcast Cable Gateway.  The ICB and
the BCG pass the ATM and MPEG signals on to the fiber optic/coaxial
cable network, which connects to subscriber homes.

     Subscriber set-top boxes must deal with "both MPEG-II and ATM
transports and. . .switch between them when switching from
interactive to broadcast programming," Mr. Adams says.  The FSN
uses AT&T Network Systems' GlobeView-2000 ATM switch, which has a
maximum throughput rate of 20 gigabits per second (20 billion bits
per second).

     Under either architecture, at the end user's home or office a
set-top box and/or a separate cable modem handles necessary signal
conversions and routing to a TV set, computer, or telephone.  "Both
(architectures) can be made to work," Mr. Adams says.  "However,
for near-term deployment of cable networks, the first option is
better for economic and technical reasons."

     Ending the ATM portion of the network at the gateway makes
sense "for the pretty long term," he adds.  "So long as we have
[one-way cable TV or broadcast TV] services and lay on digital
interactive video, which we believe is the correct order, this
makes sense."  He notes, though, that the ATM Forum of senior
telecommunications engineers has been talking about wiring
individual homes with internal ATM networks.  "Pretty spacey," he
says.

     Time Warner's FSN in Orlando deploys ATM technology to the
home partly because, when the project started, MPEG-II compression
and transmission were not well defined or standardized and did not
carry data well.  "Now, it is well defined, and there is good
mapping of data," Mr. Adams notes.  "So it is pretty future-proof."

     Time Warner, Tele-Communications, Inc., and other operators
field-testing Microsoft's ATM-based Interactive Television (MITV)
system--and other network programmers and system operators as well-
-will begin transmitting signals in the advanced MPEG-II format
this year.

     Set-top boxes used by direct satellite TV systems DirecTV and
PrimeStar are "very close, if not exactly, MPEG-II capable," Mr.
Adams says.  He points out that TELE-TV, a video programming
venture involving several Bell regional holding companies, and
other companies are placing big orders for MPEG-II-capable set-top
boxes.

     Although MPEG-I and -II were developed specifically for video
streams, technical standards have been agreed upon for MPEG-II to
handle data and voice transmissions accurately, Mr. Adams says. 
Therefore, his recommended architecture could handle any service a
network operator might want to offer consumers, he notes.  (The
Orlando FSN currently is testing one-way and interactive on-demand
video programming.  It will add telephone and computer-based data
services as the project progresses.)

     Deploying an ATM network all the way to the end user might
make sense in a business park, where customers need major
multimedia, desktop videoconferencing, and other high-tech
services, Mr. Adams continues.  

     Today many local area networks serving major business parks or
corporate campuses already have ATM switches installed, making it
easy for the broadband plant operator to continue the line, he
notes.  Mr. Adams says he has no hesitation about deploying
ATM-switched backbone networks.  Today "ATM is in such good shape
in terms of standardization and interoperability," he adds.

     "ATM is installed, working, and stable, and we're glad" to be
using it, says David Fellows, Senior Vice President-engineering and
technology for Continental Cablevision.  Continental installed an
ATM backbone network to physically interconnect its New England
cable systems.  The 200-mile fiber optic infrastructure includes
Kittery, Maine; Portsmouth and Concord, N.H.; Boston, Marion,
Needham, Newton, Northampton, and Reading, Mass.; and Enfield,
Conn.  The engineering control center is in Reading.

     What had been individual system headends are now nodes on the
ATM backbone.  Continental is using Lightstream-2020 ATM switches. 
"ATM was installed in anticipation of rolling out high-speed data,"
Mr. Fellows reports.  Continental also uses its ATM network to send
digital commercials out to systems for insertion on channel
lineups, for inter-company data transmission and mail, for employee
Internet access, and for inter-company telephony.

     Video programming for the cable systems is sent on a parallel
fiber cable, not the ATM network, Mr. Fellows says.  Because the
two fiber networks were built at the same time using the same
trenches, the economic impact of adding more fiber to carry the
cable video separately was "basically not a big deal," he explains.

     Unlike Time Warner's FSN, which is running MPEG video over its
ATM network, "we're not contemplating running our core video on the
ATM network," Mr. Fellows says.  "At the moment we don't need to." 
But when demand arises for real-time interactive video services,
then "ATM is the way we think we're going to do that," he says.

     For now, Mr. Fellows agrees with Mr. Adams' conclusion that an
ATM network should end at a hybrid fiber/coax system and that all
video, data, and voice communications should be sent to residential
neighborhoods via MPEG-II transport.  He questions when, and at
what price, set-top boxes will handle both ATM and MPEG-II
transmissions.

     Continental started studying such a high-speed information
highway about two years ago.  At that time, Mr. Fellows notes, the
company explored the use of fiber digital data interconnect (FDDI)
technology, which was considered reliable.  "But it couldn't go 200
miles, so we knew at some point we would need to switch to ATM," he
says.  At that time, however, ATM was not 100% ready for
deployment.

13th Reconsideration Order Helps--and Hinders--Cable TV Rate
Regulation

By Nicholas P. Miller and Rick Ellrod--Miller, Canfield, Paddock
and Stone, P.L.C.

     The primary goal of the FCC's 13th order on reconsideration in
its cable TV rate regulation proceeding is to encourage cable TV
operators to seek rate increases annually rather than quarterly;
most operators have sought quarterly increases under previous
rules.  The FCC's Sept. 22, 1995, order added the new annual filing
method as another option in the existing rules, rather than
replacing the quarterly rules.

     For cable TV operators, the benefits of the annual rate
adjustment filing include the reduction of delays in recovering
costs and the elimination of a potential loss of revenue under the
current rules.  Another benefit is a reduction in administrative
burdens on regulators.  The benefit to subscribers is "reduced
confusion" from multiple rate increases.

     The order makes several other significant changes in rate
review, most of which appear to be favorable to cable operators. 
These changes affect regulatory procedures, review deadlines,
franchise requirements subject to pass-through, and basic and cable
programming service-tier increases.

     The 13th reconsideration order adopts an annual rate
adjustment methodology designed to permit operators to recover
projected cost increases by filing a new FCC Form 1240.  The form
was scheduled to be released in December but has been delayed
because of the recent government shutdown.  This method will allow
recovery of "reasonably certain and reasonably quantifiable"
changes in external costs, inflation, and the number of regulated
channels that are projected for the next year.

     A "true-up" mechanism will reconcile the difference between
projected and actual costs at the next annual filing.  But it also
will add another layer to the already complex rate review process
and could further complicate a franchising authority's ability to
determine whether the operator is charging reasonable rates.  The
projected costs fall into the following categories:

     *    Inflation projections will use an estimate issued by the
FCC each September, based on the preceding 12 months' inflation.

     *    External costs may be projected if they are reasonably
certain and reasonably quantifiable.  Copyright fees,
retransmission consent fees, other programming costs, FCC
regulatory fees, and cable-specific taxes are presumed to be
reasonably certain and quantifiable.

     This presumption does not affect an operator's duty to respond
to reasonable requests for information from a franchising
authority.  It also does not extend to the costs of new franchise
requirements, which may be projected only if the operator shows
that the anticipated increases are reasonably certain and
quantifiable.  The cable operator has the burden of proving that
costs are reasonably certain and quantifiable.

     *    Rate increases for projected channel additions are
generally applied once a year.  But an operator may make one
additional adjustment at any time during the year for any number of
new cable programming service (CPS) channels, or for basic channels
if there is only a single tier.  In addition, if channel additions
are required by federal or local law (that is, for "must-carry";
local origination; public, educational and governmental [PEG]
access; or leased access channels), it appears that an operator may
pass through the costs of such additions immediately.

     Costs projected in the annual adjustment are passed through to
subscribers in 12 equal monthly installments.  If an operator
elects not to pass through such costs, it may accrue them with
interest for a later rate increase.  Under the annual method, the
FCC stipulates that cable operators retain the right to increase
rates later if they do not take the increase at the beginning of
the rate year.

     Interest ceases to accrue, however, if the operator
deliberately postpones a rate increase.  The FCC has ruled in
earlier proceedings that 11.25% is presumptively the cost of
capital for cable operators, and interest will be charged at this
amount.  Curiously, the interest rate for refunds to subscribers is
still the IRS rate for tax refunds:  8%.

     In addition to reconciling projected and actual costs, the
"true-up" mechanism creates an opportunity for cable operators to
recover lost subscriber revenues when a franchising authority has
denied a rate increase that later is overturned by the FCC.  

     Until now, the FCC routinely has granted stays of local rate
orders because operators might suffer irreparable harm and could
not recover lost subscriber revenues under the current rules.  The
FCC's rationale for granting the stays has been removed, however,
because the "true-up" mechanism will allow the recovery of such
revenues.

     Equipment rates will be adjusted annually on the same date as
service-tier rates are changed.  Thus, an operator using the annual
method will file FCC Form 1205 on the same day it files Form 1240. 
However, actual past costs rather than projected costs still will
be used to determine equipment rates.

     The date of the annual adjustment normally is chosen by the
cable TV operator.  But the operator first must notify the
franchising authority of the proposed date.  If a proposed
adjustment date is unacceptable, a franchising authority may reject
it for "good cause"--for example, if the review period falls within
the period of a city council recess (a rare recognition by the FCC
of the realities of local government operations).  If the operator
and the franchising authority cannot agree on a date, the
franchising authority may set the filing date up to 60 days later
than that originally proposed by the operator.

Annual Method Involves Changes in Deadlines

     The annual method brings with it a number of procedural
changes, making it more difficult for franchising authorities to
ensure they are complying with the right deadlines.  In general,
annual rate adjustments for the basic tier are filed 90 days before
their planned effective date.  At the end of the 90-day period,
they become effective unless the franchising authority rejects them
as unreasonable, subject to later reduction and refund.

     Under the annual method, the franchising authority need not
issue an accounting order to preserve subscribers' rights to
refunds.  On the other hand, cable operators gain two new ways to
avoid refunds under the annual method:

     (1)   If an operator inquires at the end of the 90-day period
whether the franchising authority still is reviewing the rate
filing, the franchising authority must respond within 15 days or
lose its ability to order future refunds or reductions.

     (2)   If a final rate order is not issued within a year, the
franchising authority appears to lose its right to order refunds or
rate reductions.  The FCC justifies this rule by stating that "one
year should provide ample time for review."  But this may be
surprising news to those communities still waiting, after more than
two years, for the FCC's own review of their CPS rate complaints.

     If there is a material change in the operator's circumstances
during the 90-day period, it may amend its Form 1240 before the
90-day period expires.  If such an amendment is filed less than 30
days before the end of that period, the review period is extended
automatically so that the franchising authority has at least 30
days to review the amendment.  The FCC creates a number of
exceptions to the 90-day review period.  For example, franchising
authorities' review period for the extra midyear adjustment for CPS
channel additions is the same as for the regular annual adjustment
(90 days).

     However, if this midyear adjustment is for a single basic tier
(where there is no CPS tier), the review period shrinks to 60 days. 
A shortened 60-day period also applies to adjustments based on
channel additions that are required by federal or local law.  Sixty
days is also the review period for filings that create a new rate
for newly introduced equipment (submitted using a special
streamlined filing of Form 1205).

     Under current rules, if a franchising authority receives a
"facially incomplete" rate filing, it can require the operator to
submit supplemental information, and the franchising authority's
deadlines for review are tolled.  In the 13th reconsideration
order, however, the FCC says the franchising authority must notify
the operator of such facial incompleteness within 45 days from the
date of the rate filing, at least in the context of the annual
adjustment method.

CPS Rate Increases Also Affected

     Under the prior rules, an operator was not supposed to
increase CPS rates for one year after an FCC-ordered rate
reduction.  Under the annual method, however, the operator
apparently may take its annual increase (regardless of any earlier
rate reduction) by filing Form 1240 with the FCC 30 days before the
planned increase.  The increase then goes into effect subject to
later reduction and refund.

     If both basic and CPS tiers are subject to rate regulation,
the operator must file so that the 90-day period for franchising
authority review coincides with the 30-day period for FCC review. 
The exception is that the operator also may file with the FCC at
the same time it files with the franchising authority.

Fees, Requirements Subject to Pass-through

     The FCC has affirmed its earlier rule allowing operators under
the quarterly method to pass through increases in franchise fees or
FCC regulatory fees within 30 days of filing.  It appears that
under this method, the franchising authority's 30-day order
functions as an accounting order, allowing the new rates to go into
effect subject to future reduction and refund.

     In general, the 13th reconsideration order repeats that only
increases in costs for services specifically required in the
franchise documents may be passed through.  But it also adds a new
criterion:  Only increases "that the operator would not have
incurred in the absence of the franchise requirement" are passed
through.  This rule is consistent with the FCC's notion that
external costs are those beyond the operator's control.  Yet, in
stating this criterion, the FCC is admitting that the benefits
whose costs are allowed as a pass-through exist only because of
local franchising.

     The 13th reconsideration order reiterates that capital
expenditures required by a franchise must be amortized over the
useful life of the items.  But the order contributes a new wrinkle: 
Operators apparently may recover an 11.25% "return on investment"
in addition to such costs.

     The following categories of franchise requirement costs may be
passed through:  technical and customer service standards that
exceed minimum federal requirements; PEG access channels and
programming; institutional networks and the provision of video,
voice, and data services to governmental and educational
institutions; and "undergrounding," to the extent it requires
removing existing cable from poles and placing it underground.  But
increased costs for normal maintenance or simple line extensions
within the franchise area are not passed through, even if such
costs are required by the franchise documents.

Franchise Fee Refund Rules Clarified

     When an operator pays refunds to subscribers, the franchising
authority must return any franchise fee amounts that already have
been paid by the operator based on those refunds.  In the 13th
reconsideration order, the FCC clarifies this obligation by stating
that the franchising authority, not the cable operator, determines
how such franchise fees should be repaid--in a lump sum, or by
offsetting the overcharge against future franchise fee payments. 
Either method may be used as long as the overpayment is returned to
the operator within a "reasonable period of time," depending on the
amount of the overcharge and its relationship to the franchising
authority's budget.

     The order also says the franchising authority must pay
interest on the overpayment at the now-typical 11.25% rate.  This
raises the prospect that the cable operator might make a profit on
the interest, since the operator must repay the franchise fee
amounts to subscribers only at the 8% IRS refund interest rate.

     In some ways the 13th reconsideration order may improve the
rate regulation process.  Most notably a return to annual rate
changes, rather than the quarterly bombardment produced by the
original rules, should be beneficial to both subscribers and
franchising authorities.

     But the FCC has implemented these improvements in a way some
believe is guaranteed to produce further complexity and more
loopholes and disputes.  Moreover, the introduction of several new,
shorter deadlines for special situations will require franchising
authorities to be even more careful to avoid running afoul of one
of the FCC's "sand traps," thus losing the right to overturn
"unreasonable" rates.

Bell Atlantic Enters Final Phase of Dover Township Video Dial-Tone
Test

     Four weeks into its eight-week video dial-tone (VDT) trial in
Dover Township, N.J., Bell Atlantic Corp. has entered the second
and final phase designed to "stress" VDT capabilities and test
basic interactivity.  While the first stage emphasized support
services such as ordering, installation, and general
troubleshooting, the second phase will concentrate on entertainment
programming, "basic interactive functions" (e.g., pay-per-view),
and "text interactivity" (e.g., on-screen ordering of premium
services), a Bell Atlantic spokesman said.  He clarified, however,
that the second phase will not include full interactive functions
such as video-on-demand.

     FutureVision, which is the only one of seven "video
information providers" that have reserved capacity on the
384-channel network to offer programming, will increase its channel
selection and test new concepts during the second phase. 

     Bell Atlantic "did learn some things" about video delivery
during the first phase, including that subscribers experienced "a
short delay" when switching channels, the spokesman said.  He said
the company plans to fix that problem during the second phase by
distributing software upgrades to its subscribers.

     In addition, he said Bell Atlantic has set up voice mail boxes
through its local telephone operations so that subscribers can keep
the company abreast of network problems as they occur.  

     Bell Atlantic also has used the voice mail system to remind
subscribers when specific tests will occur (for example, if the
company wanted to test its pay-per-view capacity by directing a
large number of people to order movies at the same time).

     "We keep in close contact with the volunteers," the spokesman
said.  "We know some of these people by name."  He claimed that
most subscribers prefer Bell Atlantic's digital signal over
incumbent cable TV operator Adelphia Communications Corp.'s current
analog transmissions.  He also noted that many people have remained
on the waiting list to test the VDT network.

     Adelphia has not made a point of questioning Bell Atlantic's
claims of better signal quality, said Randy Fisher, Adelphia
VP-General Counsel.  But the company's interviews with subscribers
testing Bell Atlantic's network indicate "there's not much
difference" between Adelphia's current analog signal and the
telco's digital picture, he said.  "It's a good picture, but it's
not so good as to drive a wooden stake into our heart," he said. 
He suggested that price, service, and network reliability
ultimately will determine which company wins customers, noting that
Adelphia still plans to vie for Bell Atlantic's telephony
customers.

     In the meantime, Mr. Fisher said, Adelphia speedily is
deploying fiber in an attempt to upgrade its network fully by the
time Bell Atlantic rolls out commercial VDT service.  The Bell
Atlantic spokesman said that will occur "in the near future" but
declined to specify a date.  Mr. Fisher noted that digital
transmission still has problems, such as its apparent inability to
handle picture-in-picture TV functions.  So it is still unclear
whether Adelphia will convert to a digital signal once it completes
the upgrade, which Mr. Fisher said is about 60% done.  Industry
working groups have not yet set a digital standard.

Bell Atlantic Defends Dover VDT Tariff

     Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic has filed reply comments with the FCC
defending its VDT tariff for Dover Township.  It accused the cable
TV industry of a "campaign of fear and intimidation, as well as
regulatory gamesmanship" that has "led many carriers to conclude
that the game is not worth the candle:  Rather than pursue the open
network vision, they are wearily agreeing simply to be cable
clones."

     Ameritech Corp., for one, publicly has abandoned the VDT model
and continues to pursue cable TV franchises around the country. 
Bell Atlantic told the Commission that its proposed VDT rates do
cover the cost of providing VDT service, despite the cable TV
industry's claims that they could promote cross-subsidization.  It
also reiterated that the terms and conditions of its VDT tariff are
"commercially reasonable and nondiscriminatory."  Bell Atlantic has
received FCC authority to deploy a VDT network in Dover Township.

     GTE Corp. also has weighed into the Dover Township
controversy.  GTE opposed the FCC's approval of Adelphia's request
for a waiver of the cable rate regulation rules.  Adelphia had made
the request in light of Bell Atlantic's impending VDT deployment. 
GTE said the waiver may do "more to enhance and perpetuate an
asymmetric scheme of regulation than to promote true competition"
and urged the FCC to relax VDT rules as well "so that competition
can flourish."

Time Warner Steps Up Ohio Fight Over Interconnection with Ameritech

     Time Warner Communications has taken a dispute over
interconnection with Ameritech-Ohio one step further, asking the
Ohio Public Utilities Commission to suspend the telephone company's
alternative regulation plan.  Citing its unsuccessful attempt to
negotiate interconnection rates and terms with the telco, Time
Warner has asked the PUC to suspend the intrastate price cap plan
that gave Ameritech broad regulatory flexibility.  Ameritech
responded by calling Time Warner's request "desperate" and
"ridiculous" and accusing the cable TV company of seeking to
"derail" its plans to provide competitive cable TV service.

     Time Warner received authorization last year to provide local
exchange telephony in the 37 counties in which it operates cable TV
systems, pending the development of comprehensive local competition
rules in the state (CTR, Sept. 8, 1995).  But Time Warner and
Ameritech have disagreed on interconnection terms, prompting the
cable TV company late last month to seek PUC mediation of their
negotiations (CTR, Jan. 12).  Time Warner made that request in its
second 60-day report to the commission on the status of those
negotiations.

     Time Warner and Ameritech representatives have met four times
since the mediation request was filed; PUC staff members attended
two of those meetings, Time Warner said.  It filed the motion
because of a "distinct lack of progress despite those efforts,"
said Marsha Schermer, Time Warner Vice President-regulatory
affairs.

     Ameritech was allowed to operate under the alternative
regulation plan because of the onset of local exchange competition,
Ms. Schermer said.  But the telco has taken advantage of the plan,
she added, acting as "virtually an unregulated monopoly, in control
of when and how they get competition."  Time Warner sought
suspension of certain aspects of the regulation plan.

     Ameritech said, however, that "substantive agreements" on many
technical and economic issues have been reached.  But Time Warner
has increased its demands every time the parties near agreement,
said James C. Smith, VP-regulatory for the telco.  He said
Ameritech, which has reached interconnection pacts with six
competitors, has been a "leader" in negotiating such agreements. 
Time Warner has "no incentive to reach an interconnection
agreement," because its "real motive is to delay competition in the
monopoly cable TV market," Mr. Smith said.

     Even if an interconnection agreement is reached, Time Warner
"doesn't seem to be ready to provide generally available local
telephone service in Ohio," he added.  "There are widespread
reports that Time Warner has not been able to deliver generally
available local telephone service in Orlando, Fla., and Rochester,
N.Y."  By contrast, Ameritech is prepared to provide cable TV
services in several Ohio communities, Mr. Smith stated.

     AT&T Corp. has weighed in with support of Time Warner's
motion, citing similar difficulties in negotiating interconnection
terms with Ameritech in Illinois and Michigan.

     Meanwhile, Time Warner has asked the Wisconsin Public Service
Commission for authority to provide switched local exchange
services in that state.  The company plans initially to serve large
and small businesses but eventually will serve residential end
users.  Time Warner also plans to offer (1) video-on-demand, (2)
high-speed access to on-line services and the Internet, (3) home
shopping, and (4) interactive video service.  In Wisconsin it plans
to build a 15,000-mile fiber optic network featuring 24-hour
"system surveillance," redundancy based on synchronous optical
network (SONET) technology, and a fiber optic backbone
architecture.

Pacific Bell Reports Video Dial-Tone Construction Delays in Some
Cities

     Pacific Bell has hit a snag in its attempt to build video
dial-tone (VDT) networks in 24 California cities--namely, most of
the cities themselves, said a Pacific Telesis Group spokesman. 
Although Pacific Bell has received construction approval in San
Jose, he noted, internal disputes between city officials and
concerns over potential disruptions to the public rights-of-way
have delayed local construction approval in most of the other 23
localities.

     In San Jose, Pacific Bell already has wired 200 homes for a
free "technology test."  With a hybrid fiber optic/coaxial network
now passing about 315,000 homes, the company hopes to expand the
trial into a commercial rollout, he said.  "We think it's
definitely going to work," he said, but local "government
ponderousness" is "holding up the network. . .We're stymied."

     Most of the disagreements have centered on money, the Pacific
Telesis spokesman said.  "Initially, they opened their arms," he
said, but then "the dollar signs started to click in their eyes"
and demands for public access channel slots, local fees, and other
forms of revenue surfaced.  The result, he said, is that some
cities purposely are holding Pacific Bell up "in order to shake us
down."

     The company has offered short-term fee arrangements until a
final federal telecom bill clarifies its local responsibilities,
the spokesman continued.  But some cities have demanded long-term
commitments now.  He conceded, however, that cities have a
legitimate concern when it comes to construction schedules, noting
that "we're not the only company that's asking to dig up the
streets."

     The problem for both cities and prospective VDT service
providers is that VDT "is in some flux" because of the pending
federal telecom legislation, said Eileen Huggard, Executive
Director of the National Association of Telecommunications Officers
and Advisors (NATOA).  She said cities want VDT construction to
mesh with other local projects or construction requests in a way
that does not excessively inconvenience local residents.  But
guidelines are unclear because of the pending bill.  "That's part
of why it's a difficult time right now," she said.  "It's trying to
plan for something that could change in a week or two weeks or a
few months."

     Other telcos have reported similar snags but continue to study
what they hope will be a lucrative video marketplace.  A
spokeswoman for U S WEST, Inc., said U S WEST Communications'
ongoing VDT trial in Omaha is in "full swing," with more than 8,000
customers now signed up despite "almost no promotional support." 
Most new customers over the last few months have surfaced because
of favorable reports about the initial technical trial that began
last year, she said.

     U S WEST is not ready to announce any new trial locations, she
said, but "we're definitely looking for trends" in Omaha--including
price sensitivity and whether service usage is seasonal.

Disney-CapCities Merger Plans Clear Department of Justice Hurdle

     The Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., have
surmounted a major hurdle to Disney's proposed acquisition of
CapCities (CTR, Aug. 11, 1995).  The Justice Department's Antitrust
Division has approved the merger proposal following Disney's
announcement that it will sell KCAL-TV, its Los Angeles television
station.  Disney is a partner in the Americast joint video
programming venture with Ameritech Corp., BellSouth Corp., SBC
Communications, Inc., and GTE Corp.  Some industry observers expect
the FCC to rule on the transfer of TV licenses related to the
proposed CapCities deal at a tentatively scheduled Jan. 31 meeting.

     The expected sale of KCAL-TV "resolves any potential antitrust
concerns that could arise from Disney's acquisition of KABC-TV, a
Los Angeles television station currently owned by Capital
Cities/ABC," Justice said.  

     The Antitrust Division had been investigating whether Disney's
ownership of both KCAL-TV and KABC-TV might lead to reduced
competition and higher TV advertising rates in Los Angeles.  Before
that investigation concluded, however, Disney notified Justice that
it planned to sell KCAL-TV.  It also pledged to maintain KCAL-TV
and KABC-TV as "separate, competing stations until the sale is
completed," Justice said.

     To help ensure that the sale of the station occurs and to
protect KCAL-TV competitors before the sale, Disney agreed to sign
a consent decree requiring the appointment of a trustee to carry
out the sale.  

     The decree will be filed in court only if Disney (1) fails to
enter into a definitive agreement within nine months to sell
KCAL-TV, (2) fails to complete the sale of KCAL-TV in 12 months,
and (3) seeks FCC authority to own both KCAL-TV and KABC-TV
permanently.

     Disney originally had sought a temporary waiver of FCC rules
that prevent broadcasters from owning two VHF stations in a single
market, saying that enactment of the pending telecommunications
legislation might render such ownership of broadcast stations
legal.  Disney now wants the Commission to approve the temporary
waiver request so it can operate both stations until the planned
divestiture of KCAL-TV is complete, a Disney spokesman said.

     Justice also examined "all potential competitive effects"
stemming from the planned CapCities transaction, including the
effect of combining the video production and distribution
businesses of Disney and CapCities, the department said.  

     It concluded that "such a combination would not violate the
antitrust laws."  Earlier this month Disney and CapCities
shareholders overwhelmingly approved the planned acquisition of
CapCities (CTR, Jan. 12).

SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND TELEPHONE CUTS MULTIMEDIA DIVISION

     Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. (SNET) has
confirmed that it will whittle from 75 to 28 the number of
employees in its Multimedia Division as it continues to merge the
remainder of the staff into its expanding publishing operations. 
A SNET spokeswoman said the company had "overstaffed" its
multimedia group because of early industry predictions that a
digital video standard would exist by mid-1995.  Because of the
current lack of a standard and uncertainty over when one will
exist, she said, SNET has determined that "it's premature to be
working on digital at this time. . .We could roll out digital
technology tomorrow, but it likely would be throwaway technology."

     Most of the displaced 47 workers will be transferred to other
areas of the company, she said, but some may be let go
indefinitely.  She was quick to stress that the multimedia staff
cuts are not a signal that SNET is backing away from digital video
technology.  The staff reduction, she said, is attributable
partially to synergies realized after the division was merged with
the publishing unit, requiring fewer people to do the work.  The
SNET publishing unit, which traditionally has overseen the
company's printed directories, has expanded into online ventures in
recent months, increasing its relevance to multimedia.

DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES

     The cable TV industry is facing "aggressive competition" as
new digital technologies allow companies to enter traditional cable
TV markets, according to a report by the Multimedia Research Group. 


     MRG says "quadrature amplitude modulation" (QAM) and
"quadrature phase shift key" (QPSK) technologies, along with the
development of Motion Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) standards, have
allowed direct broadcast satellite and multichannel multipoint
distribution service providers to achieve "stunning success,"
resulting in "unexpected new opportunities."

DirecTV BEEFS UP SATELLITE NETWORKS

     DirecTV, Inc., has announced an agreement with PrimeTime 24,
its a la carte network feed service, to add the NBC station in Los
Angeles, San Francisco's CBS affiliate, and the ABC station in
Seattle.  PrimeTime 24's offerings now include the ABC and NBC
affiliates in New York City; the CBS affiliate in Raleigh, N.C.;
the Fox station in Chicago; and the PBS network in Denver.  The
expanded service became available on Jan. 17 for $4.95 per month. 


     The cable TV industry has criticized direct broadcast
satellite (DBS) service in the past because it does not carry local
broadcast networks.  PrimeTime 24 President Chuck Griege said the
addition of the West Coast affiliates will increase viewing
flexibility by allowing subscribers to "take advantage of time zone
differences."  Meanwhile, DirecTV also announced that it has
authorized Matsushita Electric Corp. to manufacture DBS receivers
through its Panasonic brand, but the terms were not disclosed. 
DirecTV is a division of Hughes Electronics Corp.

ATM TECHNOLOGY:  A CLOSER LOOK

     Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) refers to a switching and
transport technology developed to transmit digital voice, video,
and data traffic simultaneously and in either direction, offering
both high speed and cost-effectiveness.  

     ATM transfer is based on moving information units, called
cells.  Digital information enters a broadband system as packets,
which are much larger than cells.  The ATM switch takes all the
incoming packets, mixes them up and cuts them into cells.  It then
sends the cells down the fiber cable in a configuration and at a
bandwidth picked to gain the most efficient transmission.  The
ATM-determined path is known as a virtual channel.

     At the destination, another ATM switch takes the cells and
recreates the original packets of voice, video, or data
information.  The packets then leave the ATM switch and travel down
fiber and coaxial cables to their destination:  a specific home
computer, television, or telephone.

     When ATM-protocol communications enter an MPEG-II broadband
cable network, they are converted out of ATM format and the ATM
signals are mapped onto MPEG.  On an all-ATM system such as Time
Warner's Orlando FSN, ATM transmissions are decoded and routed to
their final TV, computer, or telephone by a set-top box.

TCI, CONTINENTAL CABLEVISION ANNOUNCE AGREEMENT

     Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) and Continental Cablevision,
Inc., have announced a definitive agreement to trade assets
covering about 200,000 subscribers in Massachusetts, Missouri, and
Illinois.  Continental will take over TCI systems serving about
100,000 customers in areas surrounding Andover, Cape Cod, Waltham,
and Nantucket, Mass.  TCI in turn will gain Continental's
operations in several St. Louis suburbs and systems in Belleville
and Scott Air Force Base, Ill.  The deal further clusters TCI's
operations in St. Louis, where it already covers the metropolitan
area.

     William Schleyer, Continental's President and Chief Executive
Officer, said the addition of the Massachusetts systems will help
the company cluster more operations in the Northeast, where its
largest customer base is located.  The terms of the agreement were
not disclosed.

INTERCONNECTION DEAL

     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., and Pacific Bell have
reached an interconnection agreement allowing Teleport to begin
offering switched local exchange service in California.

     Teleport, a competitive access provider, is owned by
Tele-Communications, Inc., Continental Cablevision, Inc., Cox
Enterprises, and Comcast Corp.  The pact is the first Pacific Bell
has reached with a competitor since the California Public Utilities
Commission released interconnection guidelines last month.

     Although the agreement on technical interconnection
arrangements will allow local exchange competition to begin, it
does not resolve every issue that is a "prerequisite to real,
effective local exchange competition," including unbundling and
database-driven number portability, said Michael Morris, Teleport
Regional Director-regulatory and external affairs.

KENTUCKY COURT UPHOLDS DENIAL OF CABLE FRANCHISE RENEWAL 

     The U.S. District Court of Owensboro, Ky., has issued an order
that may become the first test of franchise renewal protections for
cable TV operators as outlined in the 1984 Cable Act.  Provisions
of that law, many of which withstood modifications in the 1992
Cable Act, made it very difficult for cities to deny franchise
renewal requests.

     The court upheld the refusal of the city of Sturgis, Ky., to
renew the local franchise of Union CATV, Inc., a 2,500-subscriber
cable TV company with two systems--in Morganfield and Sturgis.  In
Sturgis, where the company has about 700 customers, the parties
could not agree on the city's "future cable-related community needs
and interests," the court said.

     Union CATV President Alan Reed said he plans to appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati as soon as the lower court
decides whether to grant a stay, which would allow the company to
continue operations pending the outcome of the appeal.  "We're
looking for a quick turnaround here," he said.  The Kentucky Cable
TV Association may file an amicus brief in the case, a spokeswoman
said.

CBS PONDERS CABLE NEWS 

     CBS, Inc., is toying with starting a cable news network, a CBS
spokesman has confirmed.  Reports surfaced earlier this month that
the historically cable-phobic company might start a news channel
after Michael Jordan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Westinghouse Electric Co., signaled interest during an interview on
NBC, Inc.'s cable channel, CNBC.  

     Westinghouse announced it would purchase CBS for $5.3 billion
in August 1995.  Peter Lund, President of CBS Broadcast Group,
recently expressed interest in cable TV services (CTR, Oct. 6,
1995, p. 13) but has not been specific about possible content.

ALL IS NOT CALM AT ALLCOMM:
ITS USE OF "CELLULAR ONE" STIRS UP A LEGAL TUSSLE

    When Pactel Mobile Access purchased the non-wireline system in Atlanta,
Ga., from Gencell and opted not to use the "Cellular One" trade name, as it has
in other non-wireline markets, the result was that no one was using the
Cellular One trademark in Atlanta.
    Enter Allcomm Telecommunications Inc., a cellular reseller in Atlanta.
Beginning last September, the name "Cellular One Atlanta" made its appearance
in the Atlanta phone book.  Call the number, however, and you'll find yourself
talking to a customer service rep from Allcomm.  "We have filed (in Georgia) as
'Cellular One Atlanta Corp., doing business as Cellular One,'" Allcomm
president Peter Bright told CS&M.  Why?  "Two reasons," Bright said.  "First,
we are providing a public service to help roamers.  We had a perfect example
today.  A Cellular One customer roaming here from Cincinnati broke his antenna.
He found the name Cellular One [in the phone book], called us, and we fixed
it."
    Second, "the name Cellular One has never been used in Atlanta and probably
never will be used.  Pactel spent multimillion dollars to promote its own
name."
    But aren't you concerned that the owners of the Cellular One trademark
might object?  "They only charge $1 a year [for a non-wireline company] to use
the name.  So we're not robbing them.  We're ready to pay our dollar, but they
won't take it.  We'll sign any document they want to provide us.  [One of their
lawyers] said we couldn't use it 'because you're a reseller and we only license
the name to carriers.'
    "Our argument is that we're a provider of cellular service.  We have a full
sales and service force that can help customers, so we decided to go ahead and
use the name....We get calls [from our phone-book listing] all the time such
as, 'I'm trying to reach a Cellular One customer roaming in Atlanta; how do I
do it?' or 'I'm roaming in Atlanta; how do I access the system?' or 'I'm having
equipment trouble; can you help me?'"
    Allcomm is the company's official name.  The name Cellular One appears only
in the phone book, not in any of the company's public advertising, its
letterheads, calling cards, etc.  "When someone calls," Bright explained, "our
reps immediately explain that, 'No, we are not Cellular One.  We're Allcomm
Telecommunications, a reseller for the non-wireline in Atlanta.  We provide
sales and service.  Can we be of assistance to you?'"
    When asked about Allcomm's use of the trademark, Southwestern Bell Mobile
Systems (which was apparently unaware of the usage) replied, in an official
statement issued through director of marketing communications Walter Patterson:
"The Cellular One logo is the service mark of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems,
and it is protected by trademark laws.  It is a violation to willingly use the
mark without the proper authorization from SBMS.  If anyone attempts to use it
without authorization, we will exercise our legal rights to prevent them from
doing so, and we have a responsibility to the companies or individuals who are
using the service mark properly.  Hand in hand with that is our responsibility
to existing and potential customers.  They should be able to feel confident
that when they call Cellular One, they are indeed dealing with Cellular One,
and not with someone else."  Patterson also added that "we haven't received a
written request from Allcomm to use the logo."  Meanwhile, Bright explained
that the earlier request had been oral; a written request is now being
prepared.  (Allcomm Telecommunications Inc., 11230 Hwy. 9, Suite 110, Roswell,
GA 30076, 404/343-9237; Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems Inc., 17330 Preston

"Cellular 21" is the company name, but it's not cellular as we know it

"Cellular 21" is the company name, but it's not cellular as we know it today.
Matt Edwards has received an experimental license from the FCC to experiment
with the new CT-2 ("CT" means "cordless telephone") technology, which is making
such a splash in Europe.  CT-2 is "single-channel, duplex, spectrum-efficient,
with frequencies that can be reused every half mile--or less," Edwards said.
He believes that CT-2 "will take away the whole low end of the cellular
business before it starts," he told us during a recent interview.  Why?
Edwards pointed out that, according to the Wall Street Journal, 70% of the
households in the U.S. have no discretionary income.  The remaining 30% have an
average of $1000 per month for discretionary income.  These figures mean that
of the nation's 78 million households, the potential cellular market is "no
more than 10 million households.  We're betting that...cellular will peak out
at 8 to 9 million....We think [CT-2] is the answer to cellular in the 21st
Century....[The new technology] is the only way of supporting a large number of
users."  (Cellular 21 Inc., 301 Route 17N, Rutherford, NJ 07070, 800/662-4520

TIME FOR A NEW ABBREVIATION:  "SRP"--"SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE"

    We are coining a NEW ABBREVIATION, which our industry has needed for a
long time.  The abbreviation is "SRP," which means "suggested retail price."
Of course, we all know a phone with an SRP of $599 will, because of carrier
bounties, sell for $399--or even less.  No manufacturer today expects any
carrier or retailer to actually sell a phone anywhere near its SRP.  The SRP
does, however, present a starting point for comparison purposes.

CES REPORT:  IS CELLULAR FINALLY GOING RETAIL?
RETAILERS, MANUFACTURERS THINK SO.

    The cellular industry as a whole may not be ready for it, and penetration
rates are a long way from showing it, but cellular is rapidly becoming a retail
product--so rapidly that the vast majority of sales (even though they may not
be "good" sales, meaning that they may be low-revenue generators for the
carriers) may soon be made at the retail level.
    That opinion, in one form or another--primarily in the way the
manufacturers are packaging, pricing and promoting their new lines and the way
that high-volume, discount electronic firms are getting into cellular--seemed
to show up everywhere we looked at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES)
in Las Vegas.
    So great was cellular's influence at CES that this show (and its summer
equivalent in Chicago) is the one that is seeing the introduction of more new
cellular products than any other show.  Could it be that cellular is finally
penetrating through to the consumer market?
    As Mark Ripley, VP-network for GTE Cellular Communications, put it in the
session entitled, "Cellular:  Not Just Another Cordless Phone":  "Cellular is
altering the way people think about communications.  Most people who use
cellular become addicted to it."
    Despite the addiction potential, the sale of cellular can be a tough one.
Al Brotsky, president of Al & Ed's Autosound of Monterey Park, Calif., put it
this way at the same session:  "If you were to ask me to choose the most
complex product to sell at retail and still make a profit, it would be
cellular, hands down."  He stressed the importance of educating the retail
salesperson.  "Only 10% of your competition has studied the latest benefits and
features of cellular," he said.  "The more you know, the more you sell for
more."
    Indeed, we are seeing the "birth of an industry," telecommunications
analyst and market researcher Herschel Shosteck of Silver Spring, Md.,
explained during a presentation at the Mobile Electronics Retailing and
Installation session during the convention.  He noted that even though cellular
has barely penetrated 17% of the business market, he predicted that the total
cellular users in 1995 should reach 12-22 million, an upward revision of his
earlier prediction of 12-20 million.  Particularly significant today, he said,
is the increased percentage of purchases that are replacement units (8%) and
add-ons (or second unit, e.g., purchase of a second phone for the spouse)
(27%).  He also noted that 48% of all portables are purchased by individuals
who already own cellular phones, which means that salespeople should go after
their existing cellular customers and attempt to step them up to a portable.
"The portable market is expanding explosively," he said.

NEC America Inc., 383 Omni Dr., Richardson, TX 75080, 214/907-4000 or

NEC America Inc., 383 Omni Dr., Richardson, TX 75080, 214/907-4000 or 800/421-
2141, introduced its new portable, the NEC P300.  It lent several models to
press and other influential attendees to try out during the convention.
Weighing in at just 14 oz., the phone is the second-smallest model on the
market and is, in fact, slightly thinner though longer than the Motorola Micro
TAC (see lead story, CSM, May 1989).  A unique feature is the built-in flip-up
1/4-wave unity-gain antenna.  Also included with the phone is a screw-in 1/4-
wave, 1.2 dB gain, rubber duck antenna for use in fringe areas.  The phone
contains 99 alphanumeric memory locations, 2- or 3-touch dial-from-memory,
automatic storage of dialed numbers, a slightly recessed power button to
prevent unintentional activation and VOX operation.  It also contains a clock
with a built-in alarm that will turn the phone on at a predetermined time--a
useful feature if you are expecting a call at a specific time but don't want to
leave the phone turned on, draining the batteries, while waiting.  Marketing
director Bruce McClelland told us the phone can survive a 2-meter drop test.
"If Braun was to build a cellular phone, it would look like this," he said.
The phone offers 80 minutes of talk time or 18 hours of standby.  Also, you can
answer a ringing phone by touching any key (except the power key); no need to
scramble for the SEND key.  Options include an external antenna and cigarette
lighter kit, as well as a handsfree kit and a booster kit for the car, plus a 1
1/2 hour rapid charger.  SRP $1799.

NovAtel showed its handheld Microclassic II, the PTR 800A.  Differences
between the new model and the PTR 800 Microclassic are largely ergonomic.
"This model is as close to the feel of a regular telephone in the ear piece as
we could make it," NovAtel Carcom VP-general manager Ira Tabankin said.  Also,
the model has no ridges between the keys and has an improved ringer.  Look for
NovAtel to introduce the PTR 825 portable in July.  It will be about 2/3 the
weight of the 800/800A, have 120 memory locations, a dot-matrix display and be
shirt-pocket size, Tabankin said.  (NovAtel Carcom Inc., 3800 Sandshell Dr.,

John Sunderland explained.  The feature is programmable from the handset.  The
user stores each phone number in a memory location as if it were a phone
number, including the SID (system ID number) and area code.  Also, the phones
come with 7-digit activation already built in, right from the factory, to make
selling the phones easier for retailers. "We provide the codes to the
carriers," Sunderland said.  "The phones cannot be unlocked until the sale is
approved.  They're secure on the shelf."

C.M. Telecom, 14675 Titus St., Panorama City, CA 91402, 818/780--0380, showed
"3 boxes, 2 phones," director of sales-eastern region Dino Vakoutis explained.
The 2 phones are AR3800M mobile and the AR3800T transportable (weight 4.8 lb.),
both of which are handsfree.  The 3 boxes contain:  (1) transceiver and
handset, (2) transportable kit, and (3) handsfree car kit.  Look for delivery
of mobiles in February and transportables in March, Vakoutis said.  The phones
have 3, 1.5 and 0.6 user-selected power settings, signal- and battery-strength
indicators, dual NAM and alphanumeric memory dial with 99 memories.  The phones
offer an autodial function, which can be turned on or off, that automatically
sends the call a few seconds after it is recalled from memory.  A new feature:
to answer an incoming call, you simply touch any of the top 12 keys on the pad.
The phone also offers one feature that helps reduce churn for the carrier.
"When you program the phone, you put a code in that prohibits the phone from
being reprogrammed unless the customer has the code.  The customer first has to
call the carrier to get the code," he said.  "This gives the carrier one last
shot at keeping the customer."  The target market:  "We are going after
carriers and distributors in a market" and offering them exclusive distribution
agreements.  The phones are also being offered for private labeling, "even on
smaller orders."  Dealer price is in the"mid-$400s" for the car phone and the
"low $600s" on the transportable.

Technophone Corp. (NEW ADDRESS:  1801 Penn St., Suite 3, Melbourne, FL 32901,
407/952-2100) is expected to introduce a new transportable, the model TC905A,
which will be available 'in about 6 months," marketing director Sandy Queen
told us.  It will be identical to the ME905 mobile.  The transportable kit is
retrofitable to the ME905, also.  Because the ESN is in the handset, you can
use the same handset with more than one phone.  The transportable weighs 6
lbs., has 1 hour of talk time or 8 hours of standby, and has a SRP of $799.
Technophone's mobile line is made in Hong Kong.
    Also new at the show:  the MC915A, which has a completely different styling
from the TC905 to make it more appealing to a retail market.  "It's a basic
model," Queen said.  It has a 30-number memory dial, ESN in the handset, and
works car-to-car with the cigarette lighter plug or can be converted into a
transportable by adding a battery.  "We're hoping that users will buy a
transceiver and a bag and use the handset from the car," Queen said.
Suggested retail:  $699.
    Technophone also introduced a new program for dealers and sales people,
Technopoints '90.  Every phone sold earns the salesperson or dealer a certain
number of points.  The points can then be traded for a variety of prizes out of
a glossy catalog.

conversations in your life" are just a few.  But we'd better stop before we put

One of the most exciting products for the portable/mobile office that we saw at
the show was the new plain paper MFAX portable fax machine from U.S. Marketing
International Inc., 7405 Caminito Rialto, La Jolla, CA 92037, 619/551-8834.
The fax uses standard, perforated computer paper, or it can also use standard
typewriter or photocopy machine paper.  It weighs a mere 3.5 lbs. and works
either on 4 "C" batteries or any 6V plug-in adapter.  It is full group 3
compatible, working at 9600 baud (25 seconds per page).  It works with either
an acoustic coupler or a direct RJ11 jack to a desk or cellular telephone.
"The businessperson can now travel with their own fax machine in the briefcase
and no longer have to pay the ridiculous cost that hotels charge you to receive
faxes," explained Arnold Fisher, president and CEO of U.S.M.I.  "I paid $54 at
my hotel to receive 13 pages of copy!" he said.  The fax machine uses an H-P
jet ink printer and cartridge and produces faxes that are equal to or even
better than the quality available from standard desk machines.  It can also be
used as a printer for your laptop, a copy machine or a scanner.  SRP, $599.

A complete package of low-tech products assembled in one gift box and called
"The Mobile Office" was the offering of S. Hochman, 320 Frontier Way,
Templeton, CA 93465, 800/852-5888 or 805/434-3400.  The complete package
contains Hochman's new Notes on the Go, a suction-cup mounted pad holder that
sticks to the car windshield, complete with a built-in flashlight to illuminate
the pad at night.  The box also contains Numbers to Go (a flip-down address
book; see CSM, April 1989, for details), a U.S. roaming directory, a penlight
flashlight, a first-aid kit, a Rand McNally state and city pocket atlas, a
tire-pressure gauge.  The complete kit retails for $49.95.  "The man in the
house is probably the hardest person in the world to buy for at Christmas or
Father's Day," company president Sandy Hochman said.  "He generally gets a
shirt, socks, yet he may spend 2-3 hours a day in the car.  So why not give him
something that's useful?  And, of course," he added, to avoid appearing to be
chauvinistic, "this also applies to the wife!  We have more and more men and
women using their cars as an office."  [A tip:  If you're having trouble
getting your Notes on the Go (or other windshield-mounted note pad) to stick on
the window, clean the window first with rubbing alcohol, not Windex; "It leaves
a residue," he said.]  "I don't think cellular carriers are grasping the value
of cellular as much as the retailers," Kochman said.  "Carriers seem to think
that every [relatively inexpensive item, such as Notes on the Go] has to be
given away as a premium.  The retailer offers these 'premiums' as accessories
for the cellular buyer and turns them into a profit center.  The way prices of
phones are coming down, the cellular stores are going to have to look for other
profit centers.  They've got a captive audience.

Cue Paging Corp., 2737 Campus Dr., Irvine, CA 92715, 714/752-9200, showed a new
mobile mount for its nationwide pager.  The mount (SRP $129, or $9.95/month
rental) is coupled with a 1/4 wave roof-mount or magnet-mount antenna--or even
the car/truck's FM antenna--and boosts the range of reception for the pager by
25%.  The effect of the boosted range is that a vehicle can travel from, say,
Boston to Miami or Detroit to Brownsville, Tex., and always be in range of the
Cue network, John Canady, director of affiliate relations, told us.  He also
said that Cue is in the process of expanding its network to Canada.

BELL ATLANTIC BEGINS FULL-SCALE TV CAMPAIGN; AIMS AT RETAIL

    The retail cellular market may finally be here.  "The time is right,"
explained Melanie vanderValk, director of advertising and corporate
communications for Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems.  "I saw our December sales
figures.  Retail sales [during the Christmas season] were significantly more
than we had been projecting....Retail is a big part of our distribution now."
    This new, intense interest in and sales response at the retail level has
led Bell Atlantic to develop a new TV ad campaign aimed specifically at
attracting both the business and retail customers.  The campaign will appear in
2 flights, the first running through April, and the second beginning in the
summer.
    "Our customer profile is shifting from 100% business to more consumer
applications," vanderValk said.  "A lot of people are starting to justify
cellular from a safety and convenience point of view."  Consumer resistance to
the product is beginning to fade, she said, because the message is finally
getting through that cellular is no longer an unaffordable technology.
    Why TV?  "Two reasons," she said.  "First, it's more economical now to use
TV than it was in the past.  We have a broader target market to reach because
cellular is now affordable to the mass market.  Second, TV advertising is very
compelling."
    The campaign consists of two 30-second commercials that spotlight the
dependability of the Bell Atlantic cellular network and how important the phone
can be when, for example, your car breaks down 15 miles from the next exit.
The three 10-second spots      emphasize how affordable cellular is today.  One
spot compares the cost of cellular to the cost of laundering your shirts:  "For
the money you spend at the cleaners, you could be using a car phone on the Bell
Atlantic System.  And, who knows?  Maybe you could clean up."  Another compares
the cost of cellular and gasoline:  "You can use a car phone...for less [then
the cost of fuel], and put something in your car that can make you money."
    To support its retail effort, Bell Atlantic has developed a merchandising
kit for the retailers, containing banners, coverage maps and prices, tent
cards, a pocket sales guide, and so on.  The pocket sales guide, for example,
is a laminated card that slips into the salesperson's pocket and provides
instant answers to the most frequently asked questions about cellular.  "We're
also in the process of testing an interactive video guide," she said, which
would allow shoppers to get answers to commonly asked questions by accessing
an easy-to-use computer data base on display at the point of purchase.  (Bell
Atlantic Mobile Systems, 180 Washington Valley Rd., Bedmister, NJ 07921,

CELLULAND'S NETWORK-WIDE PROMO EXCEEDS SALES QUOTA BY 150%

    Working together as a network, CelluLand recently demonstrated that
combined buying power can work wonders.  Combining the purchasing clout of 23
nationwide franchisees in 9 states with special market development funds
available from Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc. (MESA), and adding in the
excitement of a sales contest, CelluLand's outlets sold more than 1,000 MESA
DiamondTel phones, exceeding their combined sales quota of by more than 150%.
The theme of the campaign was, "The best things in life are free."  The
salesperson who sold the most phones during the 2-month contest received a
Caribbean cruise.  Other prizes ranged from Bahamas cruises through TVs, VCRs
and cellular phones.
    Mark Epstein, the director of special projects for CelluLand, drew on his
experience selling stereo/hi-fi equipment in the 1970s and computers in the
early 1980s when he concocted the idea for the special promotion.
    "Market development funds, which are also called key account funds, are
funds that are...used if anybody comes up with an interesting way of promoting
their product," Epstein said.  "Most manufacturers don't promote the fact that
they have these funds available, but if you go to them with a good idea, they
have the funds available.  It's a matter of knowing how to present your idea to
the manufacturer."
    Epstein convinced Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc. (MESA) to expend
these market development funds in a joint promotional effort.  "I came up with
a promotion idea to try and stimulate sales of their product throughout our
franchise network," he said.  "They committed the funds subject to our
purchasing the product over a 60-day period.  We exceeded our quota by 150%.
We expected to sell 400 phones; we sold more than 1,000."  Seeing that this was
the first joint promotion, we were a bit conservative in our estimates....From
everyone's standpoint, it was a tremendous success."
    None of the advertising mentioned the price of the product.  "We positioned
ourselves not as a discount-price shop but as someone who could really deliver
quality and service at a higher price," he said.  One ad, for example, was
headlined:  "They say the best things in life are free."  The ad pictured MESA
DiamondTel portable and car phones.  The "free" benefits applied to accessories
and services, not to the price of the phone itself, and included:  Free mount
and antenna (with car phones), free carrying case (with transportables), "free
time to devote to leisure and business activities."  "Service sets us apart":
free testing and tuning, free loaner phone when necessary, free one-year
extended product warranty and free lifetime installation warranty.  (CelluLand
Inc.,  10717 Sorrento Valley Rd., San Diego, CA 92121, 619/455-1600.)

WASHINGTON (D.C.)-AREA BUSINESSES START
AN ASSOCIATION FOR CELLULAR USERS

    Cellular carriers, independent cellular carriers, cellular dealers and
cellular agents all have their own trade associations, and now so do cellular
users.  "If users are better educated and understand their phones better,
they'll be better customers," explained Jess Johnson, one of the organizers of
the National Association of Cellular Users (NACU).
    "The new association is not in competition with existing associations such
as CTIA, Telocator or USICTA," co-founder Mike Manning told CS&M.  Johnson and
Manning are partners in the Vienna, Va.,-based company Marketing International.
The third co-founder is David Shira, president of Cellular Savers Group Inc.,
also of Vienna, Va.  "Just like them, we want to expand the cellular industry,"
Manning said.  "The association is intended to provide services directly to
users of cellular service.  We're hoping to get people to use the system more
and get others to get on board and start using cellular."
    The founders are in the process of incorporating the association, adopting
its by-laws and forming its board of directors.
    The association will also express its point of view on legislative and
regulatory issues such as calling-party pays and the registration (or even
outright prohibition of ownership, as has been proposed for teenagers and
pagers) of cellphones.
    Vendors, carriers, agents and manufacturers are also invited to join as
associate members.  "We want them to feel at home with us," Johnson said.  "We
are now talking with industry leaders to form a standards and good practices
committee to promote a better climate for the continued growth of the cellular
industry," the group said in its first official statement.  "If you are
interested in contributing your expertise or would like to learn more about the
association's charter, services and membership costs, call 1-800-736-4720."
