ith this issue, we mark our First Anniversary, the ending of an incredible 12 months during which SMOKE has grown in every conceivable way at an unprecedented rate.  To our readers, our advertisers, the smoke shops, the staff, the Lockwoods, and last, but not least, my family:  Thank you, one and all.  (Anyone not included in the above list that feels slighted, please insert your name and know that it applies to you too!)
<P>
The Holidays have always been about togetherness and belonging: feelings that we cigar smokers get to feel year-round.  Smoking a cigar with another lover of the leaf will break any awkwardness or lack of understanding; it brings a commonality to the table that allows everyone to relax; and lighting up with a neophyte creates an instantaneous bond that words can not express.  
<P>
We've all heard the stories such as:  you run out of cigars in the middle of nowhere and a total stranger gives you one upon hearing you mention it to the person you're with; or, you're walking down the street, someone comments on what you're smoking and you hand out a stick.  There is a universal truth in the karma of giving out a cigar, I guess because it is a gesture so far beyond what words can convey.  
<P>
A cigar is not just about lighting up a bunch of dried out, rolled up leaves.  It's about moments, relationships; it's about pleasures, it's about life.  I suppose that's 
<IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="020a.jpg">
why this sense of belonging prevails year-round.  I feel sorry for those who will 
never experience this and/or want to quash it.  It astonishes me that these anti-smoking, anti-meat eating, anti-alcohol consuming, anti-fornicating, health nazis want to take away the few physical pleasures we have left on this earth.  Where do these people come from?  What do they do for enjoyment?  I wish I had the opportunity to take all of them to a steak dinner, downing a bourbon, and lighting up a stog' -- then let them curse the unity of cigar smokers.  Instead, I think they will come to recognize what the rest of us already know; that cigar smokers, although not an elite group, are a passionate one; we are generous and truly carry that special "togetherness feeling" that others experience only once a year.  But most of all, we have a love and passion for life!  Happy Holidays everyone -- smoke 'em if you got 'em!

<IMG ALIGN="left" ALT="L" SRC="lfinck.gif">ike father, like son is more than just a saying when applied to the Finck family of San Antonio, cigar barons of the southwest.  For four generations, Finck fathers have passed their interest and passion for cigars onto their sons.  
<P>
"We are probably the most diverse cigar company in the United States," observes Bill Finck Jr., 34, the most recent family member to join Finck Cigar Company, which celebrated its 100th anniversary three years ago.  Finck Cigar Co. manufactures a popular line of machine-made short-filler cigars in addition to its Travis Club machine-made long-filler cigars, which until recently were distributed primarily in Texas.  The company also is the exclusive U.S. distributor of Cruz Real cigars from Mexico, and is preparing to import two of its own premium handmade blends from the Dominican Republic and Honduras.
<P>
The family's traditions are deeply ingrained.  "I've been around cigars since I was a little kid," says semi-retired company president and family patriarch Henry William "Bill" Finck Sr., 65.  "I used to sack tobacco stems in the factory when I was 8 years old.  We sold the bags for nests for homing pigeons for 50 cents a piece."  
<P>
Bill Jr. and the family's other six children, two boys and four girls, all worked at the factory at various times while they were growing up.  Only Bill Jr., however, got tobacco in his blood.

<H2>AN OCCASIONAL SERIES</H2>
<H3>by <B>Dr. Adrian Bartoli</B></H3>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="top">It's nearly impossible to turn on the television for any length of time without espying hordes of manly "ho-ho-ho-ing."  Santa-esque actors, barely able to disguise their superfection of how all those years of Shakespearian training have come to this.  Likewise, it's difficult to smoke even a few cigars without hearing tales of pre-Castro Revolution cigars.  Most of use are like to balk when we hear that the going rate s about $75 a stick.  What could POSSIBLY make a pre-Revolution cigar SO much better than one rolled today?  I mean, the tobacco plants come from the same seed; the rollers are still the same (though they may have relocated.)  Yet anyone who has tasted a pre-Revolution cigar will recall its seemingly limitless complexity, a certain musty elan, the sweet kiss of decay that the cigar left gently lingering on your lips.  What it comes down to, of course, is aging.
<P>
Cigars change as they age.  Anyone who has bought a box of cigars, smoked a few and put the rest away for a few months has probably discovered this.  The first time it happens, you say to yourself, "I don't remember it tasting like this before..."  Then you start wondering if the cigars have gotten some blue mold disease and you start scrutinizing each and every cigar in the box.  Then you start wondering if you're going mad.  But, don't worry!  It's just the natural aging process!  (Of course, I mean!)  This aging process is probably most pronounced in the first year.  Some people prefer cigars young and fresh while others appreciate an older, more experienced cigar -- it's all a matter of taste.  To those who prefer the flavor of aged cigars, the obvious question is, "Hey, why not age my own cigars?"  Since vintage cigars are not commonly sold (and, when they</TD><TD VALIGN="top"> are, the prices are exorbitant), this turns out to be a pretty good question.  
<P>
The basic ingredients of cigar aging are:  1) cigars, 2) a place to age your cigars and 3) time.  The amount of time you age your cigars, is, as I said, a matter of personal preference.  In general, you should probably age them at least a year, but I've never been able to wait that long.  Now, the last thing you want to have happen is to patiently age your cigars for a year or more only to find that after all that, they taste like dirt!  This is where #1 and #2 on the ingredient list come into play.  The first thing to think about is what types of cigars you're going to age.  Like politicians, not all cigars age well.  In the game of aging, a cigar must be built to withstand the rigors and challenges of -- well, basically sitting motionless in a box for a really long time.  No big deal, right?  Wrong!  As we shall see when we discuss #2, there is a virtual WAR going on inside your humidor, and your cigars must be built like battleships to survive!  With each day that cigars age, they lose an infinitesimal amount of the oils and aromatic compounds that give them flavor and character.  If you start out with really light, grassy-tasting cigars, within a few years you will have cardboard!  Look at the ends of the cigars to find the ones rolled with darker, richer tobacco.  Keep in mind that these cigars, which when aged will have pleasantly rich flavors, when young may smell like a kitty litter box that hasn't been changed in a month, much in the same way that good wines for aging are too tannic to drink when young.

<IMG ALT="C" ALIGN="left" SRC="ccigqa.gif">ombined, Dan Blumenthal and Frank Llaneza have been in the cigar industry long enough to have been selling cigars to both Confederate and Union soldiers.  And if they had actually lived some 140 years ago, that is just what a pragmatic, tough-as-nails New York Native and a soft-spoken Southern Gentleman who speaks with a slight drawl, respectively, would have done.  Individually these two men have, for the better part of this century, seen all the cigar booms and busts that the world has had to offer.  They are legends in the cigar industry.  For the past twenty-five or so years, they have combined their special talents in the form of a company called Danby-Villazon.  Drawing upon a Hollywood analogy, this company is similar to Miramax in that they are big enough to do things their own way, </TD><TD VALIGN="top">but small enough that they do things exceptionally well.
<P>
This past Fall, word had leaked out that Danby-Villazon was in negotiations to sell itself to the Culbro Corporation, the parent company of General Cigar Company.  When this deal is consummated -- which all parties seem to agree that it will be -- Blumenthal and Llaneza will continue to run things; however, one can't help but feel that part of an era is ending.  SMOKE caught up with these two cigar tycoons to bring you the following candid conversation about the way things were in the cigar industry, how they are today and where they are going; but, more importantly, it is a first-hand chronicled account of the cigar industry from two of the few men left to tell it.

The actress was hired to work a single day opposite Dennis Franz.  So compelling was Lawrence that she's been  "Blue" ever since.  In fact, Sylvia Costas, the very human Assistant D.A., wife of beleaguered cop Andy Sipowicz (Franz), and mother of their child, is one of the show's most popular characters.  The North Carolina-born, theater-trained actress has wisely</TD><TD VALIGN="top"> capitalized on the opportunities "Blue" presented her, performing in several popular TV movies.  Most memorably, however, Lawrence mercilessly chewed the scenery in a "Caroline in the City" guest stint, and that paved the way for her starring role in "Fired Up," an NBC mid-season replacement that's generating quite a buzz.  Here, SMOKE catches up with the vibrant, chatty Lawrence before she embarks on the double-duty task of acting in both "NYPD Blue" and "Fired Up." </TD></TR></TABLE>

As the company's vice president, he directs its day-to-day operations.  A Texas A&M graduate, Bill Jr., notes that he finished college on a Friday and started to work at the factory the following Monday.
<P>
A college degree wasn't in the future for Reinhold Finck, Bill Jr.'s great-grandfather, who came to San Antonio in 1852 -- 16 years after David Crockett, Col. William Barrett Travis and Col. James Bowie died with their troops defending the Alamo against the Mexican army.  The Civil War to start nine years later.  
<P>
Reinhold Finck started a German-language newspaper, but fled the city for New Orleans in the 1860s at the height at a cholera epidemic.  Reinhold's son, Henry William Finck, returned to San Antonio for health reasons after managing cigar factories in New Orleans and New York.  He started Finck Cigar Co. in 1893 on the lower floor of the family's modest two-story home.  
<P>
"My grandfather learned the cigar-making trade in New Orleans," Bill Sr. says.  "There were cigar companies in just about every town in the country back then."  
Indeed, at the time Finck Cigar came into existence, cigarettes had not yet become popular; four out of five American males, and more than a few women smoked cigars.
<P>
"When he opened Finck Cigar he lived upstairs and made cigars downstairs," Bill Sr. says.  "He'd make about 300 cigars a day, then pack them up and ride around the city on his bicycle and sell them on the streets.  At the time, there were 16 cigar companies in San Antonio.  All you needed was a table, <I>chaveta</I> and a few pounds of tobacco.  None of the other companies are around anymore."
<P>
Henry William Finck's signature cigar was the Finck Cheroot, which he sold in a wooden box in quantities of 250 for $2.  "He obviously was very bright and very diligent," Bill Sr. says.  "They got to be the biggest cigar factory west of the Mississippi."
<P>
Henry William's three sons, including Bill Sr.'s father, Edward Reinhold, worked in the factory.  Bill Sr.'s father was responsible for buying the tobaccos that were hand rolled into Finck Cigars.  "Daddy would go to Cuba, Puerto Rico and Connecticut to buy tobacco," Bill Sr. says.  "Back then, trips like that were a big deal.  To buy your own tobacco, and Daddy was good at that, you got on the train to New Orleans and then you got on a boat to wherever.  Sometimes he'd be gone for months, but he always brought back good tobacco."
<P>
The company prospered during the middle of the century, introducing machine-made cigars in the 1940s to save labor costs.  
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="058b.jpg" hspace=15>
Like many other cigar companies, Finck Cigar reached a watershed when President Kennedy stopped commerce between Cuba and the United States in 1961.  "The Cuban embargo had a big effect on us," Bill Sr. offers.  "At the time, we used the best Cuban filler.  Cuban tobacco that is aged right is really, really good."
<P>
The embargo forced the company to find other sources of tobacco, quickly -- primarily in Jamaica.  Later Finck Cigar switched its blends to tobacco from the Dominican Republic and Honduras.

Special Features:  This self-touted "men's specialty shop" is pure Madison Avenue.  Though the walk-in humidor is often depressingly bare of Davidoff's own cigars, the store itself is a treat.  High-ceilinged and heavy on the chrome and polished glass, the store may lack warmth, but the cheery sales staff more than make up for it.  In the Christmas season, come early unless you don't mind waiting on a slushy city sidewalk.  And bring your credit cards.  After all, when you pay for the name, nothing comes cheap.<BR><BR CLEAR>

Special Features:  The only shop in the City where the wooden Indians are for sale (as are the wooden cowboys, cowgirls, sailors, etc.).  The kind of place your grandfather haunted in his day.  A long, dingy shop, complete with a candy counter and classic "trading-store" barrels full of cheapie items.  There are no more 10 cent cigars to be had, here or anywhere, but this is as close as you'll get.  Mom's also stocks a selection of their own cigars, but don't expect to be pampered while you choose.  The attitude here is quintessential New York:  curt, forthright, no hi-jinks.  In New York we call it typical.  Elsewhere they might call it "rude."

must make sure that the tobacco is rolled into good cigars.  Obviously, if you're going to invest the time and energy to age cigars, you'll want to insure that they will be smokable when the time comes.  Finding a well-constructed cigar is important.  A cigar which is too loosely rolled may lose all of its flavor by the time you have aged it, while a cigar which is too tightly rolled may crack its wrapper with changes in temperature and humidity.  The size of the cigar is also important.  The larger the ring gauge, the greater the variety of tobacco leaves and hence, the more complex the final flavor of the aged cigar will be.  Further, the insides of larger cigars tend to be somewhat shielded from the outside environment, less apt to be affected by fluctuations in humidity and temperature (hence, the "cone" of ash produced in young cigars that are rapidly loosing their moisture content).  This added stability that larger cigars provide is highly desirable for long-term aging.   
<P><P>
Probably a good 50%, if not more, of a cigar's flavor is determined by its wrapper, making this something you'll want to focus on when you're picking out your cigars.  As we mentioned earlier, it is the oils and aromatic compounds that provide the cigar with much of its flavor.  The amount of oil in a cigar is revealed by the presence of small oil spots, as well as translucency of coloration and the presence of variegation and mottling (these occur in the body of the leaf and are not to be confused with bruising, which occurs along veins and indicates damage caused by the crushing of leaves, or with the small, white "sunspots" which are relatively harmless).  Aromatic compounds impart a yellow to reddish tint to things, turning the otherwise pale brown cigar wrapper a deeper shade of reddish brown.  Hence, a darker colored cigar may be more appropriate for aging.  Don't be confused by "maduro" cigars, whose dark coloration and distinctively strong, sweet flavor is produced by a process of artificial aging.  While these cigars have found a place in many people's hearts, they will not benefit from aging.  While the inner filler and binder will age nicely, the wrapper of these cigars has been "fixed" -- essentially killed, as far as aging is concerned.  The same is true of other "cured" cigars from Brazil, the Philippines, etc.  You may also note that most cured cigars are not kept humidified, for this very reason.  Letting a cigar dry out also serves to "fix" its flavor, by causing dehydration and oxidation, leading to polymerization and chemical decomposition, which precludes further aging from occurring.  
<P>
This brings us to the important topic of #2:  "where 'ya keep 'em" -- that is the</TD><TD VALIGN="top">environment of the aging cigars.  Everyone has probably guessed, based on the presence of walk-in humidors (the large temperature and humidity-controlled rooms found in quality cigar stores) that temperature and humidity may be just a teensy bit important in aging and maintaining cigars.  Fundamentally, cigars should be kept at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 percent relative humidity -- the well-known 70-70 rule.  Any more and your cigars will rot; any less and the aging process begins to be impeded.  And by the way, that fancy, decorative hygrometer often found in cigar stores and humidors is just that -- a decoration.  Use it to brighten up your Christmas tree, but don't believe the little dial.  You can tell the correct humidity by experience:  the cigars will be supple and the foot will yield to gentle pressure easily without "crackling" or "rustling" but will feel elastic to the touch.  The cigar which feels "mushy," "spongy" or which drips when you squeeze it, has been over-humidified.  The more obsessive-compulsive of you can obtain a relatively accurate hygrometer at your florist.  
<P>
The most crucial aspect of aging is maintaining a stable environment for your cigars.  A constantly fluctuating milieu spells disaster.  Rapid changes in temperature and humidity cause cigars to expand and contract, cracking their wrappers and may also lead to partial "fixation," disrupting the aging process.  Ideally, one would have a sort of decompression chamber, much like the ones used by divers to use upon entering and exiting the humidor, which would be lit solely by darkroom "red light."  Not everyone can afford this happy condition.  For those of us here on Earth, there are a few pointers you may want to follow.  Avoid exposing cigars to direct sunlight for months on end.  This would give you a bad sunburn, and your cigars don't like it either.  Sunlight heats things up and provides energy for chemical reactions and photosynthesizing creatures.  Uneven heating can dry cigars out and ruin them.  Extreme cold is also the enemy of cigars (i.e., the refrigerator) since it causes water condensation and at times crystallization, as well as shifting many volatiles to a solid phase, effectively "fixing" them and stopping the cigar aging process.
<P>
Cigar aging is an active, "living" process.  You can't just shut your cigars in a sealed box at a specified temperature and humidity and be done with it.  The chemical reactions of the aging process produce many, at times noxious, gasses as by-products, which if allowed to build up would be an impediment to further aging.  But by providing egress for these gasses, we also provide an opening for water vapor to escape spoiling our constant humidity.  This problem resulted in the invention of the humidor, an open box with a constantly replenished humidity element.  Ideally, the space in the humidor should be at least twice the volume of cigars

Bill Sr. recalls.  "Everybody was trying any tobacco they could get their hands on.  The tobacco merchants would send samples, and I smoked and smoked and smoked until I turned purple.  The tobacco that we ended up with made cigars that were milder than what we had been making with the Cuban filler we had used up until then."
<P>
The embargo made it necessary for Finck to forge new relationships with non-Cuban growers to insure that other tobacco would be available.
<P>
"We've always been very careful to maintain a source of tobacco supply.  Sometimes it's been difficult, but we grew and we're still here in the cigar business."  Chuckling, Bill Sr. adds:  "We're too dumb to quit."
<P>
"The best cigars coming out of Cuba now don't match up to pre-embargo days," Bill Sr. offers.  "In the Cuban heyday, they had a lot of tobacco -- some was good, some was OK and a lot of it was terrible.  You had to be careful what you bought, but you could find good tobacco and good cigars.  Today, about 90% of the Cuban cigars I've smoked have been very disappointing.  I don't think they cure the tobacco very well."
<P>
Bill Sr. says that the 20 years' experience that growers in the Dominican Republic and Honduras have with Cuban-seed tobacco is paying off with some excellent crops.  
<P>
"Cuban-seed tobacco in the Dominican Republic has its own taste and Cuban-seed tobacco from Honduras has its own -- they are not the same.  The Cuban-seed tobacco they are growing in both countries now is pretty uniform in taste and they get a good burn on it.  It's got some characteristics of Cuban tobacco that their native tobaccos don't have."
<P>
Finck Cigar Co.'s most recognized cigar is the Travis Club -- a line of 11 all-tobacco machine-made cigars, two of which are a long-filler, short-filler combination that sell for between 60 cents and 75 cents each.  The other nine varieties are short filler.  The Travis Club Premium line, which recently became available nationally, consists of six sizes -- all machine-made long-filler featuring Cuban-seed Dominican and Brazilian tobaccos wrapped in a Connecticut-shade leaf with a Connecticut broadleaf binder.  Prices range from $1.70 for the Palma to $2.60 for the Churchill.  
<P>
The Travis Club is named for an early 20th century social club in honor of Col. William Travis that Henry William Finck contracted to make cigars for.  "We have the No. 1 cigar in Texas in the Travis Club Senator," Bill Jr. says.  The Senator is 5-3/16 inches long with a 52-ring gauge and is one of Finck Cigar's short-filler/long-filler combinations.  
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Travis Club Premium line has been in limited production until recently.  "We've made just a few Travis Club Premium for 15 or 20 years, and we've sold them only in Texas.  We decided to get serious about distributing them last spring.  The demand has been huge," Bill Jr. says.  
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="059b.jpg" hspace=10>
Bill Jr. says that nearly as much labor goes into manufacturing a machine-made 
cigar as goes into a hand rolled cigar.  The primary difference, he says, is the time 
that it takes to roll the cigar.  "It can take up to four people to make a machine-made cigar," Bill Jr. says.  "There is a tremendous amount of hand work."
<P>
Both father and son are involved in selecting and buying the tobacco that goes in to Finck cigars.  "We've used some of the same farms for years," Bill Jr. says.  "My dad understands how to make cigars properly and how to make them without sacrificing the quality."

you intend to keep, to minimize flux.  One should take note that what retailers call a "fifty-cigar" humidor will, when packed, hold about fifty 6" x 42 ring gauge (corona size) cigars, and so will in actuality have a somewhat smaller capacity if you have nothing but churchills or toros in there.  
<P>
Essentially, any container you can construct to fulfill these criteria should be adequate.  Some of us are quite content to use an old picnic cooler with a couple of bricks (unglazed) or a hunk of florist's clay, both of which hold water superbly well.  The less intrepid, and more well-heeled, will be inclined to purchase a real honest-to-gosh wooden humidor, complete with a tiny sponge that you can add distilled water to with a tiny, little dropper.  This will provide hours of fun for many but does not actually work any better.  Many would also insist on using distilled water rather than tap water.  Using Evian or other non-distilled waters won't lead to any significant mold or bacterial "contamination" unless you use sea water or water from a nearby fresh water lake, but the more obsessive-compulsive among you may be distressed by the eventual "hard-water" build up on your humidification device (caused by the trace minerals present in all but steam-distilled water), at which time you have my permission to go out and buy a new sponge.  If you dearly love your shiny metal-plated humidification system, then distilled water is a must.  
<P>
Others would argue that the cedar wood interior of the costly, wooden humidor is a superior aging environment. (I won't spoil the fun by saying that I just go down to Woolworth's, get some cedar wood anti-moth blocks and drop 'em in the picnic cooler.)  The case for cedar is a valid one.  The oils and volatile compounds of the cigars are</TD>    
<TD>constantly mixing and evaporating during the aging process, leading to a blending of flavors.  Any compounds added to the environment by the substance of the container itself can also react or act in a catalytic way.  Metal and glass tend to be relatively inert.  Plastic and wood both have adsorptive properties and, over time, acquire a tacky buildup of evaporative oils and aromatics.  Ideally, these compounds should stay in the cigars.  Otherwise, we would have to smoke the humidor to get any flavor, a less than ideal situation.  Cedar wood, however, is a highly aromatic wood, full of its own oils which also evaporate and result in a state of homeostasis, minimizing the loss of oils (and flavor) from cigars.  With the passage of time, the interaction of these tobacco oils amongst themselves and with the cedar oil of the wood leads to a mellowing and blending of flavors resulting in the subtle complexity which many associate with "pre-Revolutionary" flavor.
<P>
<I>By following these simple guidelines, you should be able to effectively age your cigars for many future generations to come.  But what do you do when you're ready to smoke those cigars?  Well, in the same ways you probably wouldn't want to be in a small, pitch dark, humid box when you're getting ready to light up, neither do your cigars (are you surprised?).  The environment ideally suited to smoking has about as little to do with the ideal aging environment as your New Year's resolutions have to do with what will actually transpire in the coming year.  Understanding these differences can mean the difference between heaven and hell in your smoking experience.  And, as always, the answers are not necessarily what you think.

In the Finck Cigar factory on Vera Cruz Avenue on San Antonio's west side, filler tobacco is blended by hand and bunched before it moves down a short conveyor belt to a point where the machine applies a binder leaf that has been selected and positioned by another worker.  The process of choosing a wrapper and positioning it so that it can be cut to shape and applied to the cigar takes place at yet another station on the machine.  Because stripping the middle vein from the tobacco leaf creates two halves of the wrapper that mirror each other, a cigar is either rolled by machines that are "lefthanded" or "righthanded."  
<P>
"We were in the hand rolling business until the early 1960s," Bill Jr. says.  The company began to introduce machine-made cigars in the 1940s, but continued to hand roll some cigars until no longer able to do so.  "The economics of making a cigar, more than anything, made us move to machine-made cigars," Bill Sr. says.  
<P>
Neither father nor son gives any quarter to hand rolled cigars.  "The quality of machine-made cigars, if you know what you are doing, can be a whole lot better than a majority of handmade cigars," Bill Jr. insists.  "They certainly are more consistent."
<P>
Bill Sr. echoes, "I've always believed that a good machine-made cigar is better than a fair handmade cigar."
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Outside the cigar business, Bill Finck Sr. is also an attorney and lobbyist.  He nurtures a reputation as an ornery politician.  Elected three times as state representative in the late 1960s, he achieved distinction as being among Texas' most powerful politicians while chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.  In the halls of the legislature Bill Sr. was fond of carrying a box of Travis Club Senators under his arm and passing them out.  
<P>
"He's pretty well-known for that," Bill Jr. says.  In 1982 Bill Sr. ran for Bexar County treasurer on a single promise -- that he intended to abolish the office.  He refused to accept the job's $32,500 annual salary and used his first paycheck to light a Travis Club cigar while standing on the steps of the county courthouse.  The treasurer's position was abolished by a Finck led referendum three years later.
<P>
When Finck subsequently threatened to run for justice of the peace, county commissioners responded by eliminating the office.
</TD><TD VALIGN="top">The Finck's have explored the thought of reinstalling hand rollers, but have been unable to follow through.  "The problem is that most of the experienced hand rollers are going through Miami, where they are being hired," Bill Jr. says.  "We've hired a number of Cubans, but they mostly have experience with machinery.  And it's hard to get rollers to come to the United States from other countries -- to leave their families and their cultures behind and come to Texas."
<P>
<IMG SRC="060b.jpg" hspace=10 align=right>

Finck Cigar employs about 80 people, many of them women, whose hands are more adept around cigar-making machinery, Bill Jr. says, with 50 or so women involved in production of the cigars.  The entire Finck line and spot production for other companies keeps more than 60 machines clanging away.  
<P>
Besides its own cigars, Finck distributes Mexican-made Cruz Real for Tabacos y Puros de San Andres S.A. de C.V.  Finck plans soon to distribute a Honduran handmade version of its "Charles the Great" line, which until recently had been made by machine in the United States.  Finck also recently stepped up production of its "Lamb's Club," line, which was previously imported in limited quantities from the Dominican Republic.
<P>
Although riding the crest of cigars' current popularity, Finck Cigar's longevity means that it's seen the good times and it's seen the bad times.
<P>
Finck Cigar Co. remained in business during the Depression by cutting the price of its cigars in half -- from 10 cent to 5 cents.  "They were able to keep the entire group of employees during the Depression," Bill Jr. says.
<P>
The company's loyalty to its employees also spurred loyalty in return.  In the late 1980s two employees -- Liberata Fernandez and Rafaela Sanchez -- retired after working for Finck Cigar for more than 70 years.  Bill Jr. is proud of that.  "When you have had something like this for four generations you want to keep it going," he says with a sweeping motion of his arm while standing on the factory floor.  "It is something that we are especially proud of."
<P>
Before their retirement Fernandez and Sanchez told a local magazine that they remembered when Bill Sr. was born, having been hired by Henry William Finck.  Sanchez succinctly described the company's founder as a "<I>muy bien hombre</I>."
<P>
The best cigar roller in Texas still works for Finck Cigar Co., according to Bill Jr.  It's his father.  "Rolling a cigar is not as easy as it looks.  I can make something to smoke, but it doesn't look pretty.  Dad still hand-makes his cigars every day, and they are good cigars.  It's part of the tradition."

# of Brands:  20<BR>
Hours:  Mon.-Fri., 10-6:30; Sat., 10-6; Sun., 12-5.<BR>
Special Features:  Alfred Dunhill New York is an Anglophiles wet dream, with clothes and accessories that hearken back to grander British Empire times.  The store boasts a beautiful new humidor, with "keep" lockers.  However, the cigar selection is extremely limited and more expensive than other retailers.  The bottom line?  It's a wonderful to look, but pricey.<BR>

Hours:  Mon.-Fri., 8:30-8:30; Sat., 10-8.<BR>
Special Features:  No glitz, no glamour -- just one of the best cigar shops anywhere.  From their generous selection to their crack sales staff, De La Concha represents that finest slice of that bygone era.  Either Lionel Melendi or George Vasquez, store manager is in the store at all times.  Both are Cuban, both are sons of the tobacco trade, and both are personable, chatty cigar scholars.  For straight-up cigar sales, it just doesn't get any better than this. <BR>

Special Features:  A bare bones, no-nonsense cigar shop.  Don't be fooled by the plexiglass cigar bins and the refrigerator full of soda: Rosie Zaretsky and her son Arthur do a booming mail-order business out of the back room (70-80% of their trade).  Consequently, Famous manages to receive shipments of many of those hard-to-find smokes.  Be forewarned:  they come unannounced and they go very quickly.  Plan to camp out on 39th Street the night before your Fuentes arrive.  <BR>

Dear Reader:<BR>
<P>
The Lockwood family has been part of the publishing industry since 1886, 
the year Henry Lockwood published the first issue of <I>Tobacco</I>.
Originally intended for the tobacco retailers in and around the Manhattan area,
<I>Tobacco</I> quickly expanded to reach the world-wide tobacco  industry.  
Continuing with that tradition, another Lockwood publication, <I>Smokeshop</I>, (which
is currently celebrating its 25th anniversary reaches tobacco retailers throughout
Northern America. 
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="soffice.jpg" ALT="Building Pix">
Through these two publications, we have become the respected source for thousands of cigar and tobacco retailers in America and around the world.  This year, Partegas celebrated their 150th anniversary.  We were there in our offices in pre-revolutionary Havana when they celebrated their 40th, and have been on the inside of the cigar scene ever since.
<P>
Now, in 1995, we have taken our expertise and commitment to the next logical step.  Drawing on our rich heritage of reporting on the industry, The sixth generation of the Lockwood family now brings you <B>SMOKE</B>.  This magazine not only contains intriguing, contemporary writing on cigars and pipes, but also revolves around the lifestyle of the young executives who partake in them.
<P>
We hope you will appreciate and enjoy our effort to bring the best part of the <B>SMOKE</B> world into the hands of those who most appreciate it.  You, the consumer.

<title>Slaughter Bill</title>
</head>
<center><h3> The National Commercial Transportation of Horses to Slaughter Bill</h3></center>

<center><IMG SRC="gif/clrrule.gif"></center>

<body>

<p><b>WHAT WAS PASSED?</b> - Authority was given to the USDA to  promulgate through "creating guidelines" for the transport of horses destined for  slaughter.  Provisions are however  "subject to the availability of appropriations".  And, no funds have been appropriated for the years 1996 or 1997. It will come up again for vote in 1998, but again, no appropriations, no enactment.  Final language was amended deleting the words "safe and humane" from the bill; regulation was replaced with mere guidelines; recommendations will be performance based (BAD) not engineering based;  and the final version took on industry studies. </p>

<p><b>BOTTOM LINE</b> - The horses did not get a thing.  They are still being transported in double decked cattle trucks with no water or rest without preloading veterinary inspections. </p>

<center><h3> VERY IMPORTANT</h3></center>


<p><b>AB3167 - By Assemblywoman Diane Martinez</b> - Amended to make it a crime to export out of this any pet or companion animal for the purpose of  slaughter and use as food. </p>


<p><b>STATUS:</b> On the Senate Floor on the Consent Calendar.  Expected to pass and onto the Governor's desk for signature. </p>

<p><b>ACTION:</b>   Please write:</p>

<center><h5>You helped name the rescued mustangs</center></h5>
<p>Remember the contest we ran in our last mailer to name the rescued mustangs?  Betty White was very touched as she read through the reasons why you chose the names that you sent in, and had a difficult time picking only two.</p>

<p>The winning names are: for the mother (mare) - Whisper and for her daughter (filly) - Shadow.  But wait, that's not all...Whisper surprised us and turned out to be pregnant!  She gave birth to a beautiful little chestnut colt named Mirage.</p>

<p>We saved mother and daughter mustangs from the slaughter earlier this year.  Originally, captured by the Bureau of Land Management, they were adopted to a man who, as soon as he had legal title, brought them to the auction to sell for slaughter.</p>

<h4><center>Congratulations to the Winners of the Winter Drawing!!</center></h4>
<center><h5>First: Angela Carroll</h5></center>
<center><h5>Second: Anne Clarke</h5></center>
<center><h5>Third: Viki Moldenhauer</h5></center>
<center><h5>Fourth: Mindy Jergens</h5></center>

<p>Redwings rescued mustangs, Shadow, Whisper, her new foal, Mirage and wild burros Brownie, Jenny and her new foal, Sage, are safe here at the sanctuary.   For the thousands of wild horses and burros who roam throughout the West on federally protected public lands they are anything but safe.</p>

<p>Wild horses and burros were considered a part of our American heritage, something to be protected and treasured for the future.  The public demanded this protection (resulting in 1971 Act to protect wild horses and burros) - at least that was the case in the past.  Public interest is no longer the driving force behind this protection.  The demands being put on the lands in the West for grazing (4 million cattle and sheep) and mine expansion have placed wild horses and burros in jeopardy.  This is evident in the increased funding within the Bureau of Land Management(BLM) for roundups.  Fewer wild horses and burros leaves more vegetation for cattle and sheep; thereby placating the ranchers who continue to apply tremendous pressure on the BLM.  If the public does not force the government to change its policies no one else will.</p>

<H5>PLEASE HELP END THE SUFFERING AND THE EVENTUAL EXTINCTION OF AMERICA'S WILD HORSES AND BURROS!</H5>

<p>Call Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt (202)208-3171 and President Clinton (202)456-1111 TODAY and tell them you're concerned about the wild horses and burros on the public lands and demand that President Clinton and Secretary Babbitt uphold the laws which were put in place in 1971 to protect them.   THANK YOU!</p>

<title>Premarin - Update</title>
</head>
<h2> Premarin Update by Bonnie Stoehn</h2>

<h5> PREMARIN is a hormone replacement drug made from the urine of pregnant mares.  It is prescribed almost exclusively to women during menopause.  The mares are kept factory farm style for most of their pregnancy in stalls too small to allow them to turn around.  Last year over 70,000 mares stood row after row, chained by the head, fitted with suspended collection apparatus that does not allow them to lie down.  Some foals are killed after birth but most are taken from their mothers after 3-4 months and sold to slaughter.  Mares who can no longer produce are also sent to slaughter. With the exception of a few farms in North Dakota, all production farms are located in remote areas of Canada. </h5>
<body>

<p>Once again this July, I traveled to England to teach Humane Horse Handling at the Redwings Horse Sanctuary in Norwich.  The minute I arrived I was handed a list of news reporters who had called for interviews.  It seems the article which appeared in our Spring newsletter on Premarin was the breaking story in the United Kingdom regarding the abuse and slaughter involved in the production of this estrogen substitute; as the name implies, Premarin is derived from pregnant mares' urine.  The drug is prescribed to millions of menopausal women all over the world. </p>

<p>I spent three weeks talking with concerned doctors, reporters, women, and even a micro-biologist about Premarin and its manufacture.  I also met with the public relations representative of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the sole manufacturer of the
drug.  The representative has become quite busy doing damage control as thousands of British women on the drug are demanding plant derived synthetic alternatives from their doctors.</p>

<p>This meeting was a unique opportunity for me to discuss our supporters' concerns about   the production of this drug with Wyeth-Ayerst.  I brought to the drug representative's attention that the pregnant mares' water intake is purposely restricted to ensure their urine be more concentrated, and therefore, worth more money. (Horses whose diets consist of dry roughage such as hay, require free access to water to guarantee their good health.) The rep countered by saying the veterinarians that Wyeth used did not consider withholding water from the pregnant mares' to be a problem.</p>

The drug company claims that, "Horses are in no way mistreated as a consequence of the manufacture of Premarin."  Again, I questioned this statement asking their rep, "What about the 70,000 plus foals that were taken from their mothers last year at four months of age and sent to slaughter?"  She insisted that the manufacture' of Premarin "...has nothing to do with that. The foals belong to the farmers and are of no concern to Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories and therefore, we have no responsibility as to their future."</p>

<p>The drug rep had a ready answer and/or denial for every point I brought up until I showed her photographs from the March 25, 1994 issue of Farmers' Weekly of mares chained in their tiny stalls. (See photo above). Looking closely, she muttered under her breath, "But they told me the mares could turn around and lie down!"  It seems the manufacturer of the most widely used prescription drug in the United states is telling a lot of people a lot of things. (Wyeth's official recommendation to farmers is that a stall be four feet wide for a 1,300 pound horse, and five feet wide for those over 1,700 pounds.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, sales of Premarin in this last year reached $700 MILLION. The company is expanding its facilities in anticipation of making more $$$$ as Baby-Boomers approach menopause; as the demand increases, so does the potential for profit. Currently, over 1,200 farmers have applied for permits to produce pregnant mares' urine. </p>

<p>Since the first Premarin article which appeared in our Spring newsletter, we have received hundreds of letters from women throughout North America voicing their outrage. They tell
us they have met with their gynecologists and stopped using Premarin.  According to a recent medical survey, 63% of doctors across America are now recommending synthetic alternatives as well as lifestyle changes. If you are on Premarin, talk to your doctor today about the alternatives available.</p>

<title>Mustang Slaughter</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2> BLM "Mismanagement" - Mustang Slaughter</h2>
</center>
<p>Did you know there are less than 35,000 wild horses and  burros left on public lands in the West?  The Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971 declared that wild free-roaming 
horses and burros are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West, and require 
protection.  Yet today, there are fewer wild horses and burros on public lands than there were in 1971, when the Act was passed.  The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for the protection of these animals, and sadly, tragically, it is this same agency which is responsible for their "fast disappearing from the American continent" By revising policy and circumventing the law, individuals within Bureau of Land Management are bringing about the destruction of the wild 
horses and burros.</p>

<p>Criminal investigations by several Bureau of Land Management law enforcement agents which would have exposed illegal activity in the Wild Horse and Burro Program, have been obstructed by numerous BLM managers and employees.  Allegations include :</p>
<p><b> Funneling of horses through and internal pipeline destined for slaughter.</b></p>
<p><b>Individuals being allowed to select wild horses and burros without having to go through the public adoption process.</b></p>
<p><b>Falsification of horse adoption documents by Bureau of Land Management employees thus allowing the illegal. slaughter of wild horses.</p></b>

<p>As a member of the American Wild Horse and Burro Alliance, Redwings Horse Sanctuary urges all of our supporters write or call their representatives in the House and Senate and demand that: 1) Grand Jury criminal investigations be allowed to continue unobstructed and, 2) that the Bureau of Land Management must uphold and enforce the law which insures the protection America's wild horses and burros. The wild horses and burros have no other advocates but us. PLEASE HELP!  Your legislators can be reached through the Washington switchboard (202)224-3111 Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971</p>

<p>Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) is attempting to reform law enforcement within the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  PEER is assisting BLM law enforcement officers who are trying to stop the illegal slaughter of wild horses that are supposed to be protected by BLM. The officers have observed horses with the BLM "freeze brand" being brought into slaughterhouses in Texas.  Selling wild horses for processing into commercial products is prohibited, even after the title has been transferred.  Unfortunately, all too often the horses end up at the slaughterhouses because meat packing companies  pay about $700.00 for each horse.  BLM maintain, however, that it is not required to enforce the law after the title has been transferred after one year. PEER will be cooperating with the grand jury investigations into the slaughter of wild horses by helping BLM law enforcement officers document the illegal activities.          PEER Reies, Summer 1994 </p>

<h2> President's Message by Bonnie Stoehn </h2>
</CENTER>
<center>
 <IMG SRC="gif/f96gif2.gif"></A>
</center>
<h4><I>Redwings takes our "Stop Horse Slaughter" message to Washington, DC. (left to right are Bonnie Stoehn of Redwings, Linda Moss of Equus, Susan Wagoner of Equine Advocates, and Cathleen Doyle of California Equine Council (Redwings Advisor).</h4></I>

<p>Horse racing, rodeo, show horses, rental stables, polo, draft horses, pony rides, wild mustangs, Premarin foals, warmbloods - what is the common thread that runs through the above list which, though extensive, is far from complete? Yes, all involve equines and sadly . . . all involve the slaughter industry. There is no impressive pedigree or amount of talent or ability that will assure any horse immunity from eventually being sold to slaughter.*</p>

<p>The only way to guarantee that horses do not go through the horrific experience of transport on a cattle truck without food or water, standing in line shaking and peeing on themselves as they wait for their turn to have a four-inch spike driven into their heads - the only way to put an end to having horses treated like yesterday's garbage, used and abused and then thrown away has nothing to do with regulations or providing rubber mats - the only way to keep horses from going to slaughter is to simply stop horse slaughter - put an end to it.</p>

<p>Those of us who have experience with politics realize that the likelihood of trying to pass a law to accomplish this through the legislative process is almost nil. That is why Redwings has teamed up with the California Equine Council** and become part of a growing coalition to put an initiative on the ballot in California for 1998 to stop horse slaughter.</p>

<p>As you may know, the initiative process bypasses the politicians and the lobbyists for those who profit from horse slaughter. It puts the decision making process in the hands of the people - polls show 93 percent of the people think horse slaughter should be stopped. We know from experience,  as goes California so goes the nation. The California initiative to end horse slaughter is just the beginning of the end for horse slaughter in this country. We hope you will lend Redwings your support on behalf of the horses as we endeavor to bring this foreign owned industry to a halt.</p>
		<p>For The Horses,    Bonnie Stoehn</p>

<p>*Hundreds of thousands of horses every year are slaughtered in this country for foreign human consumption.</p>
<p>**CEC is the organization that spearheaded the successful attempt to ban horse tripping in California two years ago. Since then seven other states have passed similar legislation.</p>

<h2> Humane Horse Sense by Bonnie Stoehn </h2>
</CENTER>
<center>
 <IMG SRC="gif/f96gif3.gif"></A>
</center>
<h4><I>When given a choice about what to put in her mouth, Clare selects the carrot (it leaves a better taste in her mouth than improperly fitting bits.</h4></I>

<p>Did you know that when someone puts a bridle on a horse. The metal bit is not held between the teeth, but instead rests on the horse's sensitive gums? Usually, depending on the severity of the bit, this causes no discomfort until the human picks up the reins, pulls back, and applies pressure.</p>

<p>Many people assume that pulling on the reins automatically causes a horse to slow down or stop. If you've ever watched a horse race you may recall that the reins are not loose, but instead are being pulled tight by the jockeys who want their horses to run as fast as they can. Obviously, pulling on the reins is not the key to asking a horse to slow down. Horses need help from a knowledgeable, compassionate trainer to help them understand that a light touch from the reins means to slow. Without such help the horse will become confused and respond to the pain in his/her mouth the same way you or I would, by trying to avoid it.</p>

<p>The usual scenario goes something like this: When the human pulls or yanks on the reins, the horse attempts to avoid the pain by opening his/her mouth. The human responds by tying the horse's 
mouth shut with something called a nose band. As the pain continues, the horse raises his/her head up high in an attempt to transfer the pain from the gums to the corners of his/her mouth. The human then ties the horse's head down using equipment such as a martingale or "tie down".</p>

<p>Some horses respond to this type of extreme physical manipulation by rearing, bucking, or even running away. Out come the whips and chains with the human feeling that any amount of physical violence is justifiable because the horse is being "bad and unmanageable" or "trying to get away with something".</p>

<p>All of this because the human did not take the time to help the horse understand in the first place. It has been my personal experience that most "so called" horse trainers know far more about using and adjusting equipment to cause this horse discomfort and pain than they know about communicating with horses. As long as students and clients continue to reward such abusive behavior by paying someone who communicates through pain, the practice will continue.</p>

<p>When you pay someone to work with your horse, they are your employee -you are their boss and as such can demand that they not abuse your horse. If your trainer's knowledge of horses only revolves around whips and chains and "devices" that force submission, by all means do your horse a favor and get him/her out of that situation. Find someone who has more to offer your horse than a trainer who is ignorant of how special, sensitive, and intelligent horses are.</p>

<p>If you need help, come visit the sanctuary and watch the humane horse handling demonstration or buy our "How To Make Friends With Horses" training video. I can be reached at (408) 624-8464. Whatever you do, don't allow someone to talk you into letting them hurt your horse.</p>

<h2> Wild Horses by Deborah Ellsworth</h2>

<h3>Grazing Bill Update</h3>

<p>Thank you - all of you who called President Clinton urging him to veto S.1459 made your point! Unfortunately, a "compromise" on Senate Bill 1459 (this is also the House number) has been negotiated by Representative Sherry Boehlert (R-NY) under pressure from Speaker Gingrich and western grazing interests. Rep. Boehlert's office has conceded "this is a bill you (environmentalists) will not like". Interested parties had hoped to sneak it onto the House floor the next day. </p>

<p>When we found out (through the GrassRoots Environmental Effectiveness Network) what was about to happen, we and thousands of others from different environmental groups began making phone calls. When I spoke to one of Rep. Boehlert's aides, he indicated that their office had been inundated with calls! 
Our efforts paid off! The earliest this bill will come to the floor is the first week in September. </p>

<h3>Call today!</h3>

<p>Please call your representative(s) and let them know of your opposition to Bill 1459 as it now stands. Your representative can be reached through the Capitol switchboard (202) 224-3121. Again, your message of NO on both S. 1459 and Rep. Boehlert's version of the grazing bill is important.</p>

<h3>Adopt-A-Horse Program </h3>

<p>The Grand Jury investigation in Del Rio, Texas will not convene as we had hoped. The Grand Jury was to look into allegations which have been made against certain individuals within the Bureau of Land Management's Adopt-A-Horse Program. These allegations concerned BLM employees who have knowingly allowed wild horses to go to slaughter. The charges have been dropped! Redwings will continue to urge the Justice Department to investigate ongoing allegations of abuse within the wild horse program. Clearly this program needs constant monitoring.</p>

<h4><I>Jasmine would have been shipped to a Texas slaughter house had Redwings not purchased her from a slaughter auction.</h4></I>

<h2>The National Commercial Transportation of Horses to Slaughter Bill</h2>

<h4>What was passed?</h4>

<p>Authority was given to the USDA to promulgate through "creating guidelines" for the transport of horses destined for slaughter. Provisions are however "subject to the availability of appropriations". And, no funds have been appropriated for the years 1996 or 1997. It will come up again for vote in 1998, but again, no appropriations, no enactment. Final language was amended deleting the words "safe and humane" from the bill; regulation was replaced with mere guidelines; recommendations will be performance based (BAD) not engineering based; and the final version took on industry studies.</p>

<h4>Bottom Line</h4>

<p>The horses did not get a thing. They are still being transported in double-decked cattle trucks with no water or rest and without preloading veterinary inspections.</p>

<h4>Very important</h4>

<h4><I>AB3167, By Assemblywoman Diane Martinez</h4></I>

<p>Amended to make it a crime to export out of the state any pet or companion animal for the purpose of slaughter and use as food.</p>

<h4>.Please take Action</h4>

<h5>Please write: </h5>
<p>Governor Pete Wilson, State Capitol, First Floor, Sacramento ,CA 95814</p>

<h5>Please thank:</h5>

<h2>Education Update </h2>
</CENTER>

<p>Throughout the year hundreds of school children come to Redwings to learn about horses. A welcome addition to their experience was the opening of the Education Center in May. The Center allows for viewing of videos on horse issues as well as books, articles, information sheets and special horse related displays.</p>

<p>In June, Lynn Loar from the San Francisco Child Abuse Council teamed up with Redwings to host a workshop. As an expert in the connection between child and animal abuse, Lynn's participation cemented the success of our endeavor. The information was so well received that Redwings is sponsoring a conference on abuse this February (1997). Lynn will return as the keynote speaker and will be joined by other experts in the field of child and animal abuse.</p>

<p>If you, or someone you know, would like to attend or participate in this conference, please call Redwings at (408)624-8464.</p>

<p>Redwings offers educational classes and workshops throughout the year. If you are interested in a field trip, tour, or would like information on upcoming educational events, please call (408)624-8464.</p>

<h2> Wild Horses by Deborah Ellsworth</h2>
</CENTER>

<h3> Speaking of Horses . . . </h3>

<p>Protect your horse! Redwings has rescheduled the Kiro Kinetics Freezemarking clinic to Oct. 12. Come join us for a day of freezemarking, identification pictures, and guest speakers. Kiro Kinetics is the only unalterable identification recognized internationally.</p>

<p>The recent theft of local horses that have yet to be recovered brings home the need to take precautions to prevent horse theft and have your horse freezemarked! Other actions include:</p>

<li> Take identification pictures of your horse in both summer and winter coats. 
<li> Don't leave your halters out to be used by  thieves. 
<li> Keep your pasture or barn well lit. 
<li> Know your neighbors, they can be your best "watch dogs" when you are away. 
<li> Create a double fencing system, a perimeter fence that can be locked with pastures and corrals inside. 

<p>Don't think this can't happen to you! If your horse is stolen immediate action is needed! The more time that is wasted the less chance you have for recovery! Call your local law enforcement agencies. Call your brand inspector, call auction houses. Call the media! Newspapers and television can reach vast numbers of people very quickly. Call the slaughter houses. Post fliers with a description and clear pictures of your horse. You must act immediately!! Redwings keeps lists of slaughter houses, brand inspectors, and auction yards which we will send to you. For further information call Shelly at (408)624-0315.</p>

<a name="center"><h4>Education Center Opens May 4</h4>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of The Harden Foundation, Redwings now has a beautiful Education Center that will have its Grand Opening May 4, 1996!  We are looking forward to sharing this special place with all those who come to visit the Sanctuary.  It will be open to the public every Open Day, and available during the week for school group tours.  Among other things, the Center will have many resource materials, including a video library, a legislative table where visitors can learn the facts about pending bills, and stationery and envelopes for letter writing.  There will also be a video monitor with a library of educational/ informational tapes covering all aspects of horse care and equine related issues.</p>

<p><LI><A HREF="http://www.horseweb.com/client/kka"> Kyro Kinetics Home Page.</A></LI> Kyro Kinetics Freeze Marking Clinic will be held at Redwings Horse Sanctuary. Come join us for a day of speakers and freeze marking.* For more information, call Shelly at 408/624-0315. Reservations are needed if you want your horse freeze marked.</p>

<p><i>*A freeze mark is a permanent, unalterable series of symbols on an animal's neck applied with an "iron " that has been immersed in liquid nitrogen.  The procedure is painless and the symbols represent information pertaining only to that animal.</p></i>

<a name="wild"><h4>Wild Horses</h4>

<p>Mother and daughter were huddled inside the horse trailer.  Bonnie and Shelly of Redwings would not have known they were there had they not asked questions while waiting for the trailer to be unloaded, and upon viewing the freeze marks, pressed the owner for more information.  Three days previously, the owner had received title to them through the Bureau of Land Management's adoption program.  They were now going on the auction block destined for slaughter.  It is illegal for mustangs to be sold for commercial purposes according to the 1971 Act protecting wild horses and burros, yet many go to slaughter because the Bureau of Land Management does not enforce the law as originally written.  I have spoken to several BLM law enforcement agents and they concurred - it is illegal.  How can it be that animals considered a national treasure are ending up at the slaughterhouse?  This mare and filly will be considered treasures at Redwings and can look forward to a safe and loving home for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>All of us have been given the responsibility of protecting the mustangs and burros which live on the public lands. I urge you to speak up for those that have no voice in Congress.  Please write and demand that, at the very least, the Bureau of Land Management make prospective adopters aware that selling mustangs to slaughter is illegal.  We have been unable to find it mentioned anywhere in their literature.  Our legislators must not forget about them and it's up to all of us to remind them of their duty to enforce the laws protecting the mustangs and burros.  Wild Horse Annie must be turning over in her grave! !</p>


<p>Wild Burro Rescue of Washington will be in charge of another roundup this year of wild burros in Death Valley.  These burros would otherwise be shot by the National Park Service.  There will be approximately 30-40 burros that will need homes.  Please contact Diana and Gene Chantos at 360/985-7282 if you're interested in providing a good home for these special animals.  Someday soon there will no longer be any wild burros in Death Valley.  They are not wanted - 400 of them have been shot since the National Park Service began implementing its policy to eliminate the burros from  the area.  Redwings personnel will be hands on assisting with the wild burro rescue.</p>

<a name="net"><h4>We've Redefined Being on the Net - The Redwings Network Finds Homes for the Horses in Distress</h4>

<p>Thanks to those of you who have called in and contributed towards making our networking system such a success.  Recently, a Redwings supporter called to see if I could help find a home for a pony with founder* at a children's camp.  If not, the little mare would be sent to auction in two days.  That didn't give me much time, but I knew with the founder she'd be sold to slaughter.  I had to act fast.  Fortunately, there are people on my list looking for horses who are willing to consider animals with some physical limitations.  The family that offered to take the pony were willing to not only give her a permanent loving home, but also devote whatever time and money it would take to bring her back to health.  It is so wonderful to know people are able to open their hearts and homes to horses in distress.</p>

<p>Please call me if you want to give a horse, pony or donkey a permanent, loving home.</p>

<p>Redwings volunteers have helped the horse sanctuary reach new horizons.  A big horse hug and thank you goes out to each and every one of you.</p>

<p>New volunteer positions are created often.  Each person either contributes services they are already skilled at or may choose to learn something new.  Volunteer positions include: technical assistance, marketing, public relations, multi-media advertising, public outreach, special events, photography and videography, ranch work, lobbying, long distance awareness assistance, etc.</p>

<p>We are always building on our volunteer program.  This year we will offer certificate courses in many areas of operation at the sanctuary. Interested in volunteering?  Call Michelle at (408) 633-0884.</p>

<p>Editor's note: Michelle works around the clock as a volunteer herself coordinating this program - Let's all remember to give her a "big horse hug" too! </p>

<a name="one"><h4>One Person Can Make a Difference</h4>
<p>We recently received a letter that we knew all our supporters must see.  It is a shining example of the difference each of you make for the horses.</p>

<p>Dear Redwings: </p>

<p>I implore the public to take an animal abuse situation in hand and put a stop to it.  I have done so many times.  One person can make a difference.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Arcadia started having Fall fairs.  I went to the second one and to my dismay they had riding ponies on leads that kept them walking at a fast pace Tied were two ponies in reserve.  I noticed one holding its foot up, unable to put it to the ground and seemed  to be in pain.  I tried to question the man in charge, but ignored me, being only interested in blood money.</p>

<p> I wrote the Arcadia Chamber of Commerce and complained and also enclosed an article where mechanical rides could be rented and suggested they use these instead of riding ponies.  I also called the director of my Humane Society and he in turn called the Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>I am happy to tell you there have been no more riding ponies, but several mechanical rides for several years now.  It's better to champion a losing cause you believe in than to keep your silence and risk nothing. Dot Marsan - Arcadia </p>

<p>Bonny was a rental horse who was being ridden on an hourly basis like thousands of other horses every day, but the stable owner was renting Bonny out even though she was suffering severe pain with a broken back.  No one seemed to notice even though she would rear up or resist being saddled.  It wasn't until the Humane Society rescued Bonny that she had any hope for the future.  They brought Bonny to Redwings Horse Sanctuary where she will live out the remainder of her days with the promise that no one will ever ride on her back again.</p>
<p> When Bonny arrived at the sanctuary, the veterinarian to x-rays and discovered that her back was fractured in three different places.  She received all the best care and attention, including acupuncture and deep body massage.</p>
<p>Today Bonny has a happy life at Redwings.  It is a joy to watch her run through the pastures with her mane flying in the wind!</p>

<H2>How To Manage Your Investments <BR>
Successfully <BR>
When You Don't Have The Time <BR>
Or Inclination</H2>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Content Summary</B> 
<P>
<B>There's no question that most people today have the judgment
and ability to manage their own money. And certainly they have
enough resources and advice at hand to do so - what with newspaper
columns, newsletters, investment guides, seminars and radio and
TV programs devoted exclusively to investment strategies.</B>

<P>
<B>Trouble is, most people either don't have the time, or the
inclination - or sometimes the discipline - to watch over what
they have. Especially when there are <U>so</U> <U>many </U>choices
to make - and so <U>much</U> <U>work</U> involved in evaluating
them all.</B> 
<P>
<B>Instead, busy people today are more inclined to put their energies
into getting more out of life; to letting other responsible people
worry about their money, so they won't have to.</B> 
<P>
<B>This paper presents some essential, broad guidelines to consider
when deciding how to</B> <BR>
<B>handle investments. Most importantly, it focuses on the questions
to ask should you <BR>
be thinking about outside help.</B><HR>

<H4><TT><B>How Times Have Changed</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Not so long ago, very few people had to worry about handling
large sums of money or extensive investment portfolios. The &quot;rich&quot;
were few and far between. And those that had money usually had
so much of it that they could afford to have professional people
watch over it full time.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>These days -- thanks to things like generous retirement payouts
-- careful saving, investment and financial planning practices
... and, of course life insurance settlements ... more people
than ever have large sums of money to handle. It's not uncommon,
for example, for one partner in a marriage to pre-decease the
other -- leaving a substantial, and often unexpected, amount of
insurance money or investments behind.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Whatever the case -- while they may be not like the very rich
of years ago -- larger numbers of &quot;average&quot; people are
faced with money management questions.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Choosing a Money Management Strategy</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>As with everything else, time may be the most important factor
in determining how to manage money. With time on your hands, you
can explore the many options available -- stocks and bonds, mutual
funds, CDs and other bank instruments, precious metals ... including
their degree of risk, tax implications, the impact of inflation
and the like.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>There's no shortage of &quot;advice&quot; available in helping
you decide what to do. Brokers, financial planners and bankers
are always available to give you some direction -- as are countless
investment publications and guidebooks, not to mention talk-shows
on both TV and radio.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Having <U>time</U>, though, is of the essence. First, it will
take considerable time just to gather your own personal information
together and establish your objectives. You must identify your
specific financial strengths and weaknesses -- evaluate your portfolio
... and determine what, exactly, are your financial goals. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Then, you have to be prepared to read and do research ...
to evaluate and analyze ... to investigate, interview and <U>probe</U>
deeply into all the &quot;paths to riches&quot; which will come
across your desk regularly. And, of course, you have to be ready
to act quickly -- otherwise, critical windows of opportunity will
be missed.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>The question is, do you <U>have</U> the time -- or more exactly,
do you want to <U>spend</U> the time -- watching over your finances
and managing your investments? The answer is maybe -- especially
if you've just reached a well-deserved retirement, have a time-consuming
interest or avocation ... or are actively involved with grandchildren
or community affairs. Or perhaps you're still involved with your
career or running a business.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Getting The Help You Need</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Whether you've managed to accumulate a substantial investment
portfolio over the years, or simply just received a a retirement
payout or inheritance -- chances are, as indicated above, you
don't have enough hours in the day to manage it. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Beyond that, it's likely you don't have the <U>discipline</U>,
either. For, as diligent as you may be in all other aspects of
your life, it's difficult to muster the <U>daily,</U> <U>full-time</U>
monitoring and precise record-keeping that profitable money management
requires.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Without the time, inclination or discipline, then -- what's
left? For many successful people, a <U>Personal</U> <U>Money</U>
<U>Manager</U> is the answer -- a trained professional who can
offer the advice and expertise required to help you keep what
you have -- and to make it grow.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Just from the standpoint of <U>confidence </U>alone, a Money
Manager is probably just what you need to help shape fundamental
decisions and re-affirm your own judgments about where you want
to go.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>For example, a Money Manager can help you analyze your financial
position and portfolio initially -- then define and set realistic
goals. Are you looking for stability .... for long-term growth
... for current income? Is there a major objective on the horizon
like a new house or a child's or grandchild's education? </TT>
<P>
<TT>Actually, making the decision to employ a Personal Money Manager
involves the same kind of commitment you make when picking a doctor
or a lawyer. You simply decide that you have confidence in his
or her judgment and that you'd like the relationship to be on-going.
Your Money Manager will get to know you as an individual ... get
to know your financial &quot;personality&quot; ... so that investment
decisions, in general terms, can be based on the way <U>you</U>
want things done.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>You want to work with a Manager you <U>like</U>, of course
-- one who is responsive, interested, and understanding. You want
to make sure you're on the same wave length ... that you both
have a clear understanding about where you want to be headed.
Your financial situation -- but mostly your <U>goals</U> ... and
attitude toward risk ... must be in clear focus before you take
another step. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Once you and your manager get a &quot;fix&quot; on where you
want to go and why, then it's a question of getting out from under
the troublesome details. The day-to-day research, monitoring and
paperwork is turned over to the professionals. Your Manager handles
the fine points; you and your financial objectives control the
basic direction of your portfolio.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>How To Take The First Steps In Selecting A Personal
Money Manager</B> </TT></H4>

<P>
<TT>Again, when thinking about a Money Manager it's a good idea
-- first -- to make sure your financial objectives are well-defined.
Write down your goals; make certain you take everything into account,
including long-term debt ... and any &quot;big dreams&quot; you
hope may come true someday. In the process of picking a Money
Manager, questions about your goals will come up frequently. So
get them written down and keep them handy.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Choose from several candidates</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Make a list of several Money Managers and plan to interview
them by phone or mail -- or if possible, in person. (Look in the
Yellow Pages under &quot;Investment Counselors or Advisers.&quot;
Or ask a Banker, Lawyer or Accountant friend for some suggestions).
</TT>
<P>
<TT>Ask each Manager to send you written material. You'll want
to volunteer some information &quot;up front&quot; about yourself,
your financial resources and your goals -- just so prospective
Managers can decide whether you're a good &quot;match.&quot; Whatever
you do, get in touch with several possible candidates.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Look at credentials</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Ask to see a copy of the Manager's Form ADV -- the Uniform
Application for Investment Adviser Registration, which must be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It will
tell you all about a potential Manager's education, experience
and background.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Questions To Ask A Money Manager</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>First, don't be reluctant to ask about <U>anything</U>. After
all, it's your money you're talking about ultimately. Besides,
you'll be expected to ask questions. That's what builds the rapport
that's so important to a good long-term relationship.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>What services will be provided?</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>In general terms, a Money Manager will manage your assets
on a day-to-day basis -- according to the guidelines you agree
on mutually. But what else? Will the Manager help you with portfolio
analysis? Tax questions? All transfers and paperwork? Regular
reports? Financial planning? <U>Find</U> <U>out</U>.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>What techniques will be used in handling your investments?</B></TT>
</H4>

<P>
<TT>Money Managers have different approaches -- methods -- in
meeting investment objectives. Ask what types of investments a
Manager prefers -- and why his or her &quot;philosophy&quot; will
work for you. Are they primarily in mutual funds, or junk bonds
or blue chip stocks? What is the strategy or &quot;game plan?&quot;
What's the safety factor -- how has the track record been up to
now, especially <I>over the long term</I>?</TT> 
<P>
<TT>It's simply a question of asking the Manager about his or
her approach to managing money -- how they will match your objectives
with investment opportunities.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>How are fees set? </B></TT></H4>

<P>
<TT>A Personal Manager should be working to improve your financial
well-being -- and not to earn commissions or sales fees based
on individual transactions. You should never feel any sales pressure
-- or that there is a conflict of interest.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>It's best to look for a Money Manager who is compensated by
set fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management.
Be sure to discuss the specifics. And if your potential Manager
uses Mutual Funds, ask about management fees and other expenses
charged by the funds. Sometimes they are assessed over and above
the Manager's fee -- which is a system you should avoid.</TT>

<H4><TT><B>What kinds of clients do you serve?</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>A Money Manager who focuses on large institutional accounts
may not be right for you. Try to discover what type and size accounts
your candidate handles generally. That way you can avoid being
&quot;lost in the shuffle&quot; should his or her interest be
in very large portfolios primarily.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Ask about the success rate with clients having portfolios
of your size precisely. And again, when asking about results --
be sure that results <I>over a long term</I> are reported to you.</TT>

<H4><TT><B>What about reviews and reporting - how frequent?</B>
</TT></H4>

<P>
<TT>Money Managers have widely different ideas about reviewing
and reporting on accounts. It's wise to ask how often your portfolio
will be reviewed -- and how frequently you will receive written
reports on its progress. Monthly reviews should be expected --
as well as quarterly written reports, at least.</TT> 
<H4><TT><B>Where will assets be held - who is in control? </B></TT>
</H4>

<P>
<TT>When you<B> </B>sign on with a Money Manager, your assets
will be held in an account with a broker or other financial institution.
But you should always have personal access to your funds. Ask
your Money Manager candidates about procedures; they will need
a limited power of attorney to buy and sell investments -- and
to re-invest the proceeds -- on your behalf. Ask about safeguards,
however. How will your account be protected against unauthorized
transfers or transactions not in keeping with your objectives?</TT>

<H4><TT><B>What about references?</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT>Ask for professional references -- such as from attorneys,
CPAs or established professional people. You should also feel
free to ask for an extensive list of clients -- especially those
known to have similar objectives to your own. Your Money Manager
should be willing to give you the information, including telephone
numbers. With references in hand, you should not be the least
bit reluctant to call and ask questions -- including those about
the personality and temperament of Money Manager you're considering.
</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>* * * * * *</B></TT> 
<P>
<TT><B>While most people who have an above-average investment
portfolio are tempted to watch over it themselves, rarely are
they satisfied with the results. Those who are responsible for
money today simply have too many choices ... face too many decisions
... to meet with success on a part-time basis. To protect money
and make it grow, professional, full-time management is virtually
mandated these days.</B></TT> 
<P>
<TT><B>Although people with money still have strong opinions about
what to do with it, the wisest among them look to qualified professionals
for help. After all, the greatest dividend money earns is in buying
time -- to enjoy life's pleasures. </B></TT><HR>

<H4><TT><B>A Check-List of Key Questions</B></TT> <BR>
<TT><B>To Ask Potential Money Manager Candidates</B></TT> </H4>

<P>
<TT><B>You may find it helpful to have the following check-list
handy during your Money Manager selection process.</B></TT>

<P>
Cabot invests client assets in aggressive or conservative growth
stocks, depending on client goals and tolerance for risk. Cabot
works to develop &quot;Heritage Stock&quot; holdings, stocks which
continue to grow and can be held for many years. The two different
stock accounts contain every stock recommended in their respective<I>
Cabot Market Letter</I> Model Portfolio. All managed accounts
utilize Cabot's Momentum Analysis, relative performance research,
and long-term market timing. <HR>

<H3>All-Seasons Accounts</H3>

<P>
Annual Goal: <BR>
Aggressive Growth: 20-35% capital appreciation<BR>
Minimum Size: $100,000 <BR>
Annual Management Fee: 2.5% on first $100,000 and declining to
as low as 1.0%
<P>
All-Seasons accounts are aggressively managed to make money in
both up and down markets. These accounts contain many of Cabot's
stock and mutual fund recommendations, as well as options, warrants,
short stock, and closed end funds. Accounts require margin and
option features (no IRA or pension/profit accounts). This account
is designed for the seasoned investor who is willing to assume
high risk and return.<HR>

<H3>Combination Accounts</H3>

<P>
Annual Goal: <BR>
Aggressive Growth: 16-18% capital apprec. <BR>
Conserv. Growth: 13-15% capital apprec.<BR>
Minimum Size: $75,000 <BR>
Annual Management Fee: 1.25% on first $100,000 and declining to
as low as 0.70%
<P>
Approximately 60% stocks and 40% mutual funds, the combination
accounts utilize recommendations from <I>The Cabot Market Letter</I>
and <I>Cabot's Mutual Fund Navigator</I>. The two different Combination
accounts contain all stocks recommended in their respective Cabot
Model Portfolios (although in smaller percentages) and certain
funds selected from <I>Cabot's Mutual Fund Navigator</I>. The
typical combination account performs well in strong markets, yet
is easily positioned defensively in weaker markets. For many investors,
the combination account provides the ideal ratio of growth and
safety. <HR>

<H3>Mutual Fund Accounts</H3>

<P>
Annual Goal: <BR>
Aggressive Growth: 14-16% capital apprec. <BR>
Conserv. Growth: 11-13% capital apprec.<BR>
Minimum Size: $75,000 <BR>
Annual Management Fee: 1.0% on first $100,000 then declining to
as low as 0.70%
<P>
Assets are invested in a diversified group of leading no-load
and occasionally low-load growth oriented mutual funds as recommended
in <I>Cabot's Mutual Fund Navigator</I> (some variations may occur).
Cabot's rigorous selection and long-term market timing is applied
to the purchase and sale of all funds. The mutual fund account
is perfect for investors who don't feel comfortable with the volatility
of individual stocks.<HR>

<H3>Income Accounts</H3>

<P>
Annual Goal: <BR>
Income w/ Growth: 7-10% current yield with a total return of 9-11%
<BR>
Protected Income: 6-8% current yield with a total return of 7-10%
<BR>
Minimum Size: $75,000<BR>
Annual Management Fee: .85% on first $100,000 then declining to
as low as 0.60%
<P>
Preservation of capital and steady dependable income are the primary
goals of Cabot's Income Portfolios. Income generated can be paid
out monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or reinvested.
The two types of income accounts are: Income with Growth, and
Protected Income. These are the safest, most conservative investment
accounts offered by Cabot. <HR>

Zoltek - Carbon Fiber for <BR>
Mass Market Applications</H2>
by Anthony Sutton, Portfolio Manager
</center>
<HR>

<P>
Harkening back to a vision of Dustin Hoffman getting career advice in "The Graduate," Zoltek conjures up one word (OK, two): carbon fiber.  And just like the silver screen advice advocating plastic as the future, carbon fiber will revolutionize the composition and quality of almost every product imaginable.  Not only is it six times stronger and two times stiffer than steel, its lighter than plastic.  Unfortunately, past applications of carbon fiber were hampered due to extremely high prices that limited it to government or defense uses.  Not any longer.
<P>
<center>
<img src="cf.jpg" alt="chart of carbon fiber price versus demand">
</center>
<P>
As the accompanying chart illustrates, as prices have fallen, the actual and potential applications have exploded in number.  Examples of new applications abound.  For example, Zoltek is working  with Morrison Molded Fiberglass Company to assist in the manufacture of automotive drive shafts that are 60% lighter in weight, yet twice as strong.  They have teamed with Thiokol to produce high volume, earthquake-proof, wrapping for bridge columns.  There is even an effort to produce the worlds longest I-girder bridge as a pedestrian crossing in Kentuckys Daniel Boone National Forest.  These few examples are in addition to Zolteks more traditional relationships, such as their alliance with TRW to be the sole provider of carbon fibers for automotive airbags.  As Zolteks proprietary process drives the cost of carbon fibers down below $5 (their goal for the year 2000), the uses for it will explode into the high volume consumer market.
<P>
The change in seasons reminds us of the adage that change is a permanent component of life.  By being unemotionally invested in aggressive growth stocks (i.e., constant change), Cabot clients will participate in the tremendous growth affiliated with "change" stories such as Zolteks.

<H2>Investment Strategy<BR>
Investing in Technology</H2>
by Matthew N. Xiarhos, Vice President
</center>
<HR>

Technology --  a single word that is simultaneously capable of producing panic in the technophobics amongst us and elation and unbridled optimism among those that embrace it.  Those that are afraid seem to think theyll never be able to keep up and theyre probably correct.  Those that embrace technology sense Americas dynamism, spirit of capitalism, and world leadership.  At times our portfolios are heavily concentrated in that broad industry classification known as "Technology."  
<P>
Consider for a moment the amount of technology that each of us depends upon every day.  Heres a typical daily routine for me: 
<i>I awaken to a digital alarm clock, come downstairs to a hot pot of coffee made by an automatic coffee maker, and warm a muffin in the microwave.  I jump in my car (which has digital instrumentation, ABS brakes, and electronic fuel injection) and head for the gym.  At the gym I use either a Stairmaster or a treadmill; both of which have electronic displays of time, calories, etc.  Some days Ill stop at an automatic teller to get a few bucks or at the gas station using one of the automatic credit card readers (both are faster than waiting in line).  At the office, I spend my entire day using a computer which is linked to a LAN (local area network) looking into a display doing research, checking quotes and account balances, and speaking with clients about our investment strategies.  I couldnt even begin to convey to you the volume of information Im exposed to daily.  Almost all of my 
contact is over the telephone.  Once Im back home again, Ill likely work in my home office for a few hours doing further investment research or browsing on the Internet.  My two young daughters have an Apple computer for which weve bought a number of educational CD-ROMs and games.  Like most homes, we have cable TV and Ill occasionally relax by watching a sitcom or movie. 
</i>
<P>
Embedded microprocessors run the digital alarm clock, coffee maker, electronic fuel injection, and exercise equipment (Intel).  High speed telecommunications transport my banking and credit card information and provide cable TV broadcasts (Ascend, Cascade and Cisco).  Millions of lines of computer code run software applications that make all this technology run smoothly and quickly (Microsoft, Peoplesoft and HBO & Co.).  And  technology consulting firms provide the leadership and vision that allows Corporate America to embrace these technologies and make them a part of their products and services (Cambridge Technology Partners).
<P>
Technology has become ubiquitous in our lives.  Technology is so pervasive, broad, and differentiated that it can be broken into dozens of segments, many of which bear little resemblance to one another save for their common lineage of the silicon wafer.  Any portfolio should be a representation of the economy in which it invests.  A great portfolio will select those companies helping to craft and implement these vast technological advances.  Our goal is to position your assets not for the past but for the future.

<H2>Mutual Fund Investing<BR>
Cabot's Recommendations</H2>
by Robert T. Lutts, President
</center>
<HR>

The dramatic growth of the mutual fund industry over the past decade now means <i>there are many more mistakes a novice mutual fund investor can make</i>.  Instead of providing you with more information about the current status of your mutual fund holdings, I have chosen to review <b>some of the potential pitfalls</b> in mutual fund investing.  We are aware that there are many effective methods in investing.  However, Cabot has some very concrete ideas concerning mutual fund selection.  We speak from our experience and are fully aware that many will disagree. Here are three common mistakes in mutual fund investing:  
<P>
1.)  <b>Avoid investing in too many funds</b>.  Nearly once a week we weed through a new clients mutual fund portfolio made up of 20 -25 different mutual funds.  This is far too many.  With this number of funds you will end up with an index type portfolio which tends to under-perform the market because of the funds fees.  What is the right number?  In our opinion three to five should usually do the trick for a growth fund investor.  And a conservative, bond-oriented investor really only needs two or three funds at the most.
<P>
2.)  <b>Avoid the now very popular buy and hold philosophy</b>.  The entire mutual fund industry has been singing the <i>"Buy and Hold Tune"</i> for better than ten years now.  And most investors and long-term mutual fund holders are now believers.  Why?  Because the market has been in a long rewarding bull market.  <i>Bear markets have not been wiped off the face of this earth.</i>  We will have another nasty bear market some day.  Ask investors in Japan if they know about bear markets.  They have had a terrible one for several years.  We expect to be able to achieve good performance for you by avoiding a good portion of the next bear market.  An important part of avoiding the next bear will be remaining on the lookout for a troubling market environment and moving to a highly defensive position at the right time.  Dont believe the buy and "hope" mutual fund story, or you will probably end up singing the <i>"Buy and Hold Blues"</i>.
<P>
3.)  <b>Avoid investing in very large funds</b>. One of the first things we look for in selecting the Cabot mutual fund holdings is the size of the fund.  We think you should avoid most mutual funds with over $2 billion in assets.  Why?  Its simple math.  In our stock accounts, we like to hold positions in stocks we really like to around 5%.  In a two billion dollar fund a 5% position would be $100 million.  This size position can only be purchased in the largest 5 to 10% of companies in nearly all markets.  This means the best companies with the most growth prospects are eliminated from the buy list.  <i>In the business of investing, a very large asset size tends to reduce performance.</i> Therefore, try to concentrate on great managers that have not been fully exploited.  Many of our favorite funds are in the $100 - $200 million size and the largest is $2 billion.  Accordingly, we suggest you avoid S&P 500 and DJIA index funds.

The Cabot Market Letter, published every other week, 24 times a year, gives advice on buying and 
selling fast-growing stocks of less well-known companies. Each issue carries two portfolios, an 
aggressive Model Portfolio (limited to 12 strong stocks) and an Emerging Blue Chip Portfolio (with a 
half dozen less volatile stocks). Once a month subscribers receive a two-page supplement, the Stock of the 
Month report. All subscribers have access to a telephone Hotline for advice in between issues. There is also a 
Fax Edition, available by subscription, which is sent the evening before The Cabot Market Letter is mailed. 
This also includes Fax Bulletins whenever we buy or sell a portfolio stock. Additionally, The Cabot Market Letter is now available by e-mail.

<HR>
<P>
It's the most exciting investment I've come across since I saw my first Xerox copier back in 1957.
Sad to say, I didn't buy Xerox because it seemed "too high." But I'm buying this new Heritage
Stock! 
<P>
Here are a few details:
<P>
It's a small New Hampshire company with $40 million in sales and 120 employees. Not well
known at all. But the firm's crackerjack research team has developed a revolutionary new printing
technology. It's a scientific breakthrough that will lead the printing industry into the 21st century.
<P>
<H4>REVOLUTIONARY, PATENTED PRINTING TECHNOLOGY</H4>
<P>
This patented printing technology uses computer controlled lasers for direct imaging onto
proprietary printing plates.
<P>
Within 17 minutes of starting time, a single pressman can be producing high quality, four-color
offset printing at dramatically lower cost. 
<P>
Any printer using this technology can drastically undercut - by 30% to 40% - the prices of local
competitors who don't use it. 
<P>
And this new technology is environmentally friendly. It uses no films. No hazardous chemicals.
No noxious fumes.
<P>
This little New Hampshire firm has already teamed up with Heidelberg of Germany, the largest
printing machinery manufacturer in the world. 
<P>
As a result, this new technology is being incorporated into the standard printing presses made by
this giant of the printing industry. 
<P>
The small firm I'm recommending gets a $50,000 royalty from each Heidelberg press using the laser
technology, along with $60,000 for each laser imaging system made in New Hampshire for Heidelberg. 
<P>
<H4>HUGE RECURRING INCOME</H4>
<P>
What excites me most about this small company is the big money that will come from recurring
income. 
<P>
You see, the new technology requires special waterless printing plates. And this obscure little
company will furnish every single printing plate, anywhere in the world, on the presses sold by
Heidelberg.
<P>
Result: a huge recurring income stream for this little firm from its patented plates.
<P>
In a way, it's like getting the contract from General Motors to furnish all the gas tanks for autos. . . .
.and also the contract to supply all the gasoline for each gas tank every time it becomes empty.
<P>
<H4>EXPLODING EARNINGS</H4>
<P>
Think of it! These plates sell for around $9.50 each. Each Heidelberg press with this new laser
printing technology uses 10,000 to 15,000 of the special plates a year. And these printing plates
cannot be reused. 
<P>
Here you have another razor/razor blade, camera/film situation. That recurring revenue is the best of
both worlds for any company. 
<P>
Gross plate revenues per printing machine in the field will amount to about $125,000 a year for this
small company. . . . .year after year after year. Multiplying $125,000 times the first 100 presses in
the field yields a revenue of $12,500,000. If half of this is profit, it could contribute about $.90 per
share to earnings. Imagine the potential as more and more of these patented plates are used on more
and more presses. In five or ten years, this firm could be earning $20 or more a share! 
<P>
Earnings will literally explode in the years ahead.
<P>
The stock of this dynamic company is poised for remarkable gains. I believe the stock has the
potential to appreciate in value by 20-fold, 30-fold or even more.

<H1><font color="#004080">Cabot's Ten Rules For Investing<BR>
In Common Stocks</font></H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

The following have been carefully selected as the most important
set of guidelines an investor can use in carrying out a successful
investment program. These rules form the foundation of the investment
philosophy used in The Cabot Market Letter.<BR>

<P>
1. COMMIT NEW CASH TO THE MARKET WHEN. . . . .BUT NOT UNTIL. .
. . .A GENERAL MARKET UPTREND HAS DEFINITELY BEEN ESTABLISHED.
This can best be determined by a buy signal rendered by Cabot's
major market timing indicators. 
<P>
2. IN GENERAL, SELECT SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES (NOT PROBLEM COMPANIES)
AS INVESTMENTS, companies with excellent management, improving
sales and earnings and superb fundamentals. Give preference to
companies whose stocks are consistently outperforming the market.
This is a good indication that those stocks are under accumulation
week after week, month after month. Relative performance (RP)
studies are a superb way to identify these companies. <BR>

<P>
3. AVOID CONCENTRATION ON THE HUGE WELL-KNOWN COMPANIES WITH BILLION
DOLLAR SALES. Their growth is limited. Favor smaller companies
with sales of &quot;only&quot; $50 million to $600 million. 
<P>
4. DIVERSIFY. . . . .BUT DON'T OVER DIVERSIFY. Your portfolio
should contain at least five but no more than twelve issues. This
provides you with enough diversification in the great majority
of cases.<BR>

<P>
5. ONCE COMMITTED TO SPECIFIC ISSUES, PRACTICE PATIENCE. This
is the single most important virtue in any investment program.
Frequently stocks don't go up as fast as you might want them to.
Nevertheless, if you can develop a persistent and tolerant attitude
coupled with plenty of patience, you will have a great advantage
over the next person. We call this STAYING POWER!! (This need
for patience does not apply to losses. Read Rule 6.)<BR>

<P>
6. CUT LOSSES SHORT. Be intolerant of losses!! Concentrate on
taking losses, almost to the point of becoming a fanatic about
it. No matter how hard you try, you are going to select stocks
that go against you as soon as you buy them. Get rid of these
stocks quickly! With most medium-priced stocks, do not let your
loss of your original money invested exceed 20%. 
<P>
7. CONTRARILY, LET YOUR PROFITS RUN!! Persist in this. Develop
staying power. Do not think of taking profits in your growing
stocks. Let your profits run and run and run. This is how big
money is made in the market. Not by taking 10% and 20% profits
but by thinking big. . . . .in terms of 100% and 200% and larger
profits.<BR>

<P>
8. AS TIME PASSES, CONCENTRATE ON ADDING MORE SHARES TO YOUR ONE
OR TWO BEST STOCKS. Try to do this during corrections in the stock,
not after the stock has posted a major run-up. Of course at the
outset you have no idea which one or two issues will perform the
best. It is only as week after week unfolds that the story of
each company develops in the price of the stock. . . . .pointing
out to you which ones are the outstanding stocks where earnings
and prices are making significant gains. These are the companies
in which you should buy additional shares. In other words, average
up, never average down.<BR>

<P>
9. TRY TO DEVELOP ONE OR TWO &quot;HERITAGE&quot; STOCKS. . .
. .stocks you might contemplate holding for five or ten years
or longer if you have a large profit, if sales and earnings continue
to show excellent improvement and if the company continues to
have superior growth potential. These stocks would be the one
or two stocks you would plan to keep right through a sell signal,
even though you sell the balance of your portfolio.<BR>

<P>
10. SELL STOCKS AND TAKE PROFITS IN THE FOLLOWING CASES:<BR>

<P>
IN A BULL MARKET
<P>
In a bull market you can tolerate long corrections, timewise,
in a stock's relative performance (RP) line. . . . .frequently
as long as 13 weeks but seldom more than 20 weeks. . . . .before
concluding that the stock's momentum has turned down. When these
limits are exceeded, sell the stock without regret.<BR>

<P>
Note: This rule does not apply to the one or two Heritage Stocks
you have identified as such and plan to keep in your portfolio.
<BR>

<P>
WHEN A SELL SIGNAL IS FLASHED BY OUR MAJOR MARKET TIMING INDICATORS
<BR>

<P>
The flashing of this signal should cause you to become very defensive.
Think in terms of preservation of capital and accumulation of
cash. Sell any stocks in which you have losses. Sell your stocks
with the weakest RP lines. Then, place mental stops on all the
remaining issues. These stops should be placed somewhere below
the low point of the previous week's trading range. Sell a stock
if it closes at or below its mental stop on any trading day. Otherwise,
hold. Such an approach will allow the exceptionally strong stocks
in your portfolio to continue to move ahead without being sold
prematurely. At the same time the other stocks that do start to
underperform the market will be sold one by one as they penetrate
their mental stops. This will automatically build up the necessary
cash for use at the time of the next market buy signal.<BR>

<TITLE>Momentum System 1000: Finding The Top Stocks</TITLE>
<META NAME="AUTHOR" CONTENT="Andy Lutts">
</HEAD>
<BODY>


<CENTER>
<H1><font color="#004080">Momentum System 1000</font></H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<H2>Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
The Cabot Market Letter, published since 1970, has developed a
growing, faithful following of individual investors as well as
banks, mutual funds, and other institutions. For the most part
these investors are not interested in a short-term trading approach
where only the tax man and stockbroker benefit. They are interested
in taking positions in growing situations where some rather substantial
profits can be accumulated over a period of months or even years.
<P>
This Momentum Analysis report will introduce you to some new ideas
of stock selection. You will find out why certain companies, with
no apparent investment following, began to turn into growing successful
enterprises. And, you will be exposed to several former most-admired
blue chip stocks where the forward momentum began to slacken months
before the realization of problems by the investing public. UNCEASING
CHANGE, FOR THE BETTER OR WORSE, IS WHAT THIS REPORT IS ALL ABOUT.
<H2>Don't Ignore The Market!</H2>

<P>
There are two distinct aspects in investing that should never
be forgotten. The first is market timing. Never, never, never
invest in stocks until you have established that the market direction
is up. This is of prime importance. NO MATTER HOW FAVORABLE THE
FUNDAMENTAL FACTORS APPEAR FOR AN INDIVIDUAL STOCK - IT SHOULD
NOT BE PURCHASED IF THE MARKET TREND IS DOWN. When the market
is in a downtrend, all stocks, the blue chips as well as the cats
and dogs, go down together.
<P>
When you invest with the guidance of Cabot's long-term market
timing indicators, you will be fully and aggressively invested
in bull markets. That's when you'll accumulate your big profits.
But in other periods, when a defensive posture is indicated, you
will gracefully move to the sidelines with most of your funds
and wait for an improvement in the investing climate. And that's
when you'll avoid losing money!
<H2>Successful Companies.....Problem Companies</H2>

<P>
Over the years, we have given a lot of thought to the various
elements that make companies succeed and fail:  improved management,
a new or unique product, increased competition, poor cost control,
lack of new products or changing tastes and desires of customers.
And we have come to recognize companies as successes and failures.
Naturally we want to invest in successful companies and get out
of the problem companies before they are generally acknowledged
as such.
<P>
So how do you determine whether a company is a success or a failure?
The stock market! The stock market is measuring, day by day, all
of the thousands of pieces of information it receives in the form
of buy and sell orders for a given company. These bits of information
are reflected in the price of the stock faster than most investors
realize.
<P>
This information then, as it is pieced together day after day,
starts forming a momentum trend giving us the first indications
of a change in the fortunes of a given company. The study of these
changes in company fortunes (and hence stock trends) is what we
have chosen to call Momentum Analysis.
<H2>Companies Have Life Cycles</H2>

<P>
Here's another way of looking at it. All living things have life
cycles. They grow, mature and then finally die. We see this all
around us in many different forms: in flowers, animals, trees
and people. BUT WE ALSO SEE IT IN ORGANIZATIONS. Organizations
grow and mature. They develop strengths and weaknesses for a variety
of reasons. And many of them die, either through bankruptcy or
merger. 
<P>
The manner in which a company gains or loses momentum can be the
result of a few major inputs or dozens of subtle inputs. Positive
inputs might arrive in the form of improved top management, increased
demand for the company's product or even improved manufacturing
efficiencies. Negative inputs could materialize in the form of
poor cost controls, increased competition or the lack of new products.
Frequently, the reason for the change in momentum is not at all
obvious to many at the time it's happening.
<P>
The typical investor receives many conflicting stories concerning
the company in which it has an interest. And he has an extremely
difficult time establishing the real story. Take IBM, for example,
when the stock's momentum turned down in 1985 at a price of 130.
At the time everything seemed wonderful. By the time the correct
story was available to the investor, the stock had plummeted to
50. Similar experiences could be cited in the cases of Boeing,
U.S. Surgical, Merck and many others. These were cases where the
stock's momentum turned down many months before the unfavorable
fundamental story was available to the public.
<H2>Why Momentum Analysis Works</H2>

<P>
YOU CAN'T HIDE A COMPANY'S RECENT PROBLEMS OR ITS NEW SUCCESSES
UNDER A BUSHEL BASKET!!! As soon as a significant change (for
the better or worse) takes place, it is bound to be reflected
in the price of the stock. And remember, it doesn't have to be
headline news. It might not even be reported to the press. But
slowly and surely, the actions of knowing investors will result
in the stock's momentum being affected.....for better or worse.
More often than not, this change in momentum is the forerunner
of a significant change in stock prices.
<H2>Measuring Momentum</H2>

<P>
Cabot uses a graphical tool called Relative Performance (RP) to
measure the action of a stock. Relative performance continually
answers the question: &quot;How is my stock doing when compared
to the market as a whole?&quot;
<P>
The stocks we are most interested in are those whose relative
performance lines continually and persistently move ahead on a
positive steep slope with a minimum of corrections. Of course
RP lines, like people, have their own personalities. Some are
fiery and dynamic, and others are composed and consistent. The
important feature to look for is that the RP line has an established
uptrend, and is thus outperforming the stock market as a whole.
<H2>What are the Fundamental Criteria of a Successful Company?
</H2>

<OL>
<LI>It's a small company, with sales between $20 million and $500 million.
<LI>It has a revolutionary product or service with a major benefit.
<LI>It has high barriers to competition, such as patents or market dominance.
<LI>It has large recurring income from disposable products or services.
<LI>It has excellent, innovative management.
<LI>It has no debt or little debt.
<LI>It has huge mass markets.
<LI>It has strong positive momentum.
<LI>It has growing sales and earnings.
<LI>It has substantial ownership by management.
</OL>

<H2>When Is It Time to Buy A Stock?</H2>

<P>
Don't buy a stock - even though the fundamentals look good - until
the RP line has established a strong, positive uptrend for at
least 13 weeks (one quarter). Naturally, when possible, you should
try to buy on a minor pullback of two, three or four weeks. But
this is not always possible. If the issue is particularly strong,
you may find yourself waiting a long time before the stock pulls
back.
<H2>The Advantages of Momentum Analysis</H2>

<UL>
<LI>It identifies the strongest issues, even in weak markets,
thereby assisting you in your selection process.
<LI>It provides you with STAYING POWER, the persistence to remain
with an attractive position - for several years if warranted -
rather than selling it simply because you have a profit. IT TRAINS
YOU TO SIT TIGHT AS LONG AS THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE LINE IS IN
A HEALTHY UPTREND. After all, if you know you are in a great issue,
why change?
<LI>It provides the continual monitoring required for stock market
success. It induces you to compare your holdings periodically,
and without hope or wishful thinking being a factor, it forces
you to take the necessary action. CONTINUAL VIGILANCE IS A DEFINITE
REQUIREMENT AS THE FORTUNES OF COMPANIES CONTINUALLY CHANGE THROUGH
THE MONTHS.
<LI>There is a big psychological advantage in using RP lines.
IT TRAINS YOU TO WATCH YOUR STRONG STOCKS GROW AND IT TRAINS YOU
TO HOPE THEY GROW MORE, not being fearful that you might lose
what profit you have.
<LI>It trains you to put more emphasis on the time element and
less on the absolute price. With RP lines you find yourself being
less concerned with the absolute price of your stock as long as
it recently hit new RP highs.
<LI>AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, IT TRAINS YOU TO SELL
YOUR WEAK STOCKS - a continual weeding out process - because it
emphasizes that they are doing worse than the averages. INDEED,
IT TRAINS YOU TO FEAR THAT THE LOSS MIGHT GET LARGER. Realistically,
it places the emphasis for action where it belongs, with your
potential losers, not with your winners that are continuing to
grow.
</UL>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
In summing up these ideas we can say that the principal objective
of this Momentum Analysis approach is to keep your funds invested
at all times in the best performing stocks. If you weed out your
poorer stocks on the first sign of RP weakness, you will automatically
be cutting your losses short and at the same time letting your
profits run. This process of letting your profits run in order
to accumulate significant long-term profits is of primary importance.

<HR>
<P>

Here at Cabot we are always searching for Heritage Stocks. These
are stocks that can remain in your portfolio as long as they can
continue to grow. . . . . sometimes for years. There are two basic
advantages of cultivating Heritage Stocks. First, you take advantage
of the eighth wonder of the world: the compounding of your profits.
This can produce wondrous results if you but let the compounding
do its job and work for you over the years. Second, there is no
greater tax haven than unrealized appreciation in soundly growing
companies. Imagine being able to postpone taxation on your profits
for years on end!
<P>
Here are Cabot's Criteria for these special kinds of stocks:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>It's a small company, with sales between $20 million and $500 million.
<LI>It has a revolutionary product or service with a major benefit.
<LI>It has high barriers to competition, such as patents or market dominance.
<LI>It has large recurring income from disposable products or services.
<LI>It has excellent, innovative management.
<LI>It has no debt or little debt.
<LI>It has huge mass markets.
<LI>It has strong positive momentum.
<LI>It has growing sales and earnings.
<LI>It has substantial ownership by management.
</OL>

<P>
If you are fortunate enough to own a stock that doubles in value,
you have a 100% profit. If you sit tight and it doubles again,
you have a 300% profit. And, if it doubles again, you have a 700%
profit. If the stock then doubles again, you have a 1500% profit.
Impossible? Not at all. All you need is a good, well-managed company.....and
time.
<H4>What is a Heritage Stock?</H4>

<P>
It's a stock in which you have at least doubled your money . .
. . .and in which the potential for profits from continued investment
remains very large. That's all.
<H4>What can a Heritage Stock do for me? </H4>

<P>
It can make you rich . . . . .through the wonderful &quot;magic&quot;
of compound growth. It can give you peace of mind, by taking you
out of the frantic world of the short-term trader/investor and
moving you into the calm world of the patient, long-term investor.
And it can help you postpone taxes. Because every year that you
don't sell that big winner is another year the mushrooming profits
can compound and the tax man has to wait.
<H4>How do I find a Heritage Stock?</H4>

<P>
You find a potential Heritage Stock using Cabot's Criteria . .
. . .and attempt to grow your profits beyond the 100% level. Only
then can you consider labeling it a Heritage Stock.
<H4>Should I buy more of my Heritage Stock?</H4>

<P>
Buy it again and again, time after time . . . . .ideally, you
want to buy more at the bottom of market corrections.
<H4>When do I sell my Heritage Stock? </H4>

<P>
In a well-established, mature company that has historically demonstrated
strong relative performance and regular earnings growth, you should
sell when the RP line (Cabot Criteria #8) deteriorates significantly.
Normally, this will be soon followed by poorer earnings growth.
But in a young, fast-developing company with a ragged history
of earnings growth and an alternately hot and cold relative strength,
the time to sell is when fundamental factors appear to diminish
the prospects for future earnings growth. In any case, we urge
you to give your Heritage Stock plenty of leeway. And here's why.
When you sell, you're betting that even after you pay your taxes
you can replace your Heritage Stock with a stock that's better.
<H4>What are today's potential Heritage Stocks? </H4>

<P>
Cabot prefers small companies. They all have the potential to
multiply their sales and earnings many times over. And they all
provide you with the opportunity to benefit from the unforeseeable
and the incalculable. When you put your money in a well-managed
company in a growth industry and then let things take their course,
you put yourself in the position to benefit from that future.
And even though you cannot foresee it, and even though you cannot
calculate it, it can reward you mightily.

<H3>
1)  The Power Index<BR>
2)  The Advance-Decline Line<BR>
3)  The Cabot Trend Lines<BR>
4)  Cabot's Two-Second Indicator
</H3>

<H3>1)  THE POWER INDEX</H3>

<P>
A very basic fact is that money always goes where it's treated
best!!! As interest rates climb, money starts to leave the stock
market, being pulled, just as a magnet pulls, into higher yielding
bonds and money market funds. And conversely, as interest rates
drop, the attraction of bonds and money market funds diminishes,
and money starts flowing back into the equity markets. This simple
truth cannot be emphasized too much.
<P>

The POWER INDEX is constructed by dividing the current month's
yield of a given short-term Treasury note by the yield of the
same note six months ago. When the current yield rises
above the six months past yield, giving us a reading of more than
1.00, a sell signal is flashed. Conversely, when the current yield
falls below the six months past yield, giving a reading below 1.00,
we get a buy signal.



<H3>2)  THE ADVANCE-DECLINE LINE</H3>

<P>
The Advance-Decline Line is constructed by taking each day's difference
between those stocks that advanced in price and those that declined.
The resulting line, generated by adding these differences every
day, is a far better method of determining the direction of the
market than the popular averages. This indicator typically hits
bottom at roughly the same time as the market and therefore is
of little help in anticipating a change in direction. But at market
tops, it's a different story. This indicator tends to level off
and move sideways several weeks or months in advance of the Dow
Industrial top. As long as the Advance-Decline Line continues
to make new highs every two or three months, the odds are strongly
in your favor. Generally, once the A-D Line fails to reach a new
high within a six-month period, the odds are against you. And
it becomes a time for extra caution. If too, the Dow moves ahead
to new highs but this indicator remains in its recent confines,
it's a danger signal that the Dow Industrials are painting a pretty
picture, but the internal market strength is fading fast. Lower
prices can be expected.
<H3>3)  THE CABOT TREND LINES</H3>

<P>
The Cabot Trend Lines are our unique way of determining the long-term
trend of the stock market. As long as both the Dow Industrials
and the Dow Transports fluctuate above their respective trend
lines, we consider the market to be bullish. If both Dow Averages
are below their trend lines, we are in a bear market. The Cabot
Trend Line for each Dow Average is a composite of two moving averages,
a 20-week and a 39-week moving average. We use only the lower
reading of the two moving averages in any week. The technique
of using two different time-length moving averages produces earlier
buy signals safely when a new bull market is getting under way
(the 20-week average) and it allows plenty of room for severe
corrections in bull markets without false sell signals being given
(the 39-week average). So using the trend principle, we can never
be on the wrong side of the market for very long. And once the
new trend forces us onto the correct side of the market, the probabilities
favor a continuation of the current market trend.

<H1><font color="#004080">When To Sell A Stock</font></H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Even in a bull market it is prudent to watch for problem stocks.
All stocks simply do not advance in unison. And individual companies
can run into problems anytime.
<P>
Many investors like to use stops just below recent resistance
levels as a basis for &quot;locking-in&quot; profits. We think
this is a mistake. For example, if we had used stops we would
have been taken out of some of our best Model Portfolio stocks
at lower levels. In general we much prefer to wait until the stock's
momentum has stalled out and turned down before selling. This
technique allows us to build up far greater long-term profits.
<P>
The stock of Winnebago is an example of a well-known stock that
was flying high until the end of 1983. At that time the stock's
fundamentals were excellent. Earnings were accelerating and the
stock price was consistently hitting new highs. No one seemed
to perceive the approaching difficulties about to swamp the company...rising
interest rates, rising gas prices, huge inventories. The RP (relative
performance) correction began at the beginning of the second quarter
of  '83. There was a bounce in August, but by October it was evident
the momentum had turned down and our RP line gave a clear sell
signal. It was a full year before the first devastating quarterly
report of poor earnings. The RP line was sagging under the weight
of insider selling. There were brief rallies in the stock's momentum
(one in 1985 and one in 1986) but the downslide continued through
1990.
<P>
The RP line, which tells us when an individual stock should be
sold, usually behaves in one of two ways. Either there is a severe
sell-off followed by a weak bounce (as in the case of Winnebago)
or the RP line tends to stall out month after month, eventually
slumping to new lows. Usually the business news concerning these
stocks is favorable. Earnings may even still be climbing. But
behind all of this pleasant news the stock is slowly being distributed
to unknowing investors. These new buyers are not aware of what
the insiders know, and so they believe the sell-off is only a
temporary correction. BUT WHEN THE RP CORRECTION PERSISTS FOR
MORE THAN THIRTEEN WEEKS, BE CAREFUL!
<P>
In a stock where you have a substantial profit, you might let the RP correction 
run to 20 or more weeks. But the longer the correction the higher the odds 
that the stock is losing its positive momentum. Sell and take your profit when 
this happens. In a stock where you have little or no profit, you should sell 
quickly if a 13-week RP correction takes place. If you are developing a loss, 
never let it grow to more than 15% or 20% of your original purchase price.

<H2>Tip Of The Month for January 1997</H2>
by Timothy Lutts
</center>

<P>
We believe your investment success comes from two factors.  One is avoiding
big mistakes.  In recent years, many investment advisors have been far too
cautious.  Misplaced concerns about fundamentals like price/earnings ratios
and dividend yields have kept them from enjoying this great bull market.
And that's been a big mistake.  (According to Hulbert, we rank fifth in
market timing over the past fifteen years.  We are proud of that record.)
<P>
The other factor is your ability to pick a few great stocks. . . . .and
hold them for their entire upward move.  You don't need many.  Past big
winners for us, for example, include Cisco, Home Depot, American Power
Conversion and Summit Technology.  From today's portfolio holdings, any one
has the potential to multiply your money manyfold. . . . .if you just give
it time.

<H1><font color="#000080">Cabot's Basic Guide to Investing<BR>
in Common Stocks for Newer Investors</font></H1>
</center>
<HR>


<DL>
<DT><B>What is a stock?</B>
<DD>A stock is more than a piece of paper.  It's a piece of a company.  Ownership of that piece of the company entitles you to vote on important matters such as the election of the corporation's directors.  It entitles you to receive any dividends that are paid.  And, most important of all, it entitles you to benefit from that company's growth over time, as the stock's price changes over time to reflect the company's progress.
<BR>
<DT><B>Why should I own stocks?</B>
<DD>To make your money grow!  Over the very long-term, stocks have proven a better investment than anything else.  Since 1945, for example, the stocks in the S&P 500 have brought investors an average annual rate of return of 11.9%.  Stocks of small companies, which grow even faster than big companies, have brought investors 14.4%.  By comparison, investors in Treasury Bills have earned just 4.7% and investors in silver have earned just 4.6%.
<BR>
<DT><B>How many stocks should I own?</B>  
<DD>The typical investor needs no more than 5 to 10 stocks.  Of course, just one stock can be enough if it goes up.  But all stocks do not go up.  And you'll find that success is generally achieved by quickly getting rid of your losers while holding, and even buying more of, your winners.  When you have a portfolio of 5 to 10 stocks, you should always be on the lookout for those that are failing to perform, thinking about where that money could be better utilized.
<BR>
<DT><B>How do I buy a stock?</B>  
<DD>First you must open an account at a brokerage firm, usually by mailing them a check.  From there, It's simple a matter of communicating your buy and sell orders.  Though It's not necessary, It's a good idea to know the stock's trading symbol (example: Microsoft's is MSFT) when you place your order.  You should also know the current price of the stock so that you can calculate the number of shares you want to buy.  At most brokerage firms, you'll pay a lower percentage as a commission if you buy larger amounts of stock.  And you'll get more favorable rates if you buy round lots (100 shares, for example, instead of 97).
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a stock broker?</B>  
<DD>A stock broker is the middle man who takes your buy or sell order and relays it to the market.  A discount broker can perform this same basic service for a relatively small commission.  And if you use a discount broker with modern technology, you may never even talk to another person.  Then there are full service brokers, where you pay a higher commission, but you get personal service from a professional.  In the best cases, this professional is able to help you by suggesting specific investment moves tailored to your personal situation.  His goal is to keep you as a long-term successful client.  But remember, the broker only gets paid when you trade.  So there is an incentive to advise you to trade. . . . .to buy and sell stocks, possibly more frequently than you should.
<BR>
<DT><B>What or Where is the stock market?</B>  
<DD>You might say that Wall Street, in lower Manhattan, New York City, typifies the stock market, because that's where most exchanges and stock brokers are concentrated.  But in this age of electronic commerce, geography really doesn't matter.  There are three major exchanges in the U.S.  The New York Stock Exchange (otherwise known as the Big Board) is where you'll find the biggest, established companies.  Many of these companies pay dividends.  The American Stock Exchange is the second oldest exchange and holds smaller firms.  And the Nasdaq. . . . .National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (or OTC market) is a particularly vibrant market where you'll find some of the fastest growing companies in the country.  The majority of Cabot's stocks are found on the Nasdaq.  All three of these exchanges provide daily price quotes to newspapers of all their stocks.  But there are other, less formal markets called the OTC bulletin board or pink sheets, where trading is less regular and risk tends to be higher.  In most cases these stocks are too speculative for us.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a dividend?</B>  
<DD>A dividend is an amount of money, paid by a company to its shareholders, usually on a regular basis.  Why does it do this?  One, to keep shareholders happy by passing on profits to them.  And two, because the company can't find a better use for the money!  Management doesn't know how to use the money to make the company grow.  Usually, the bigger the dividend, the poorer the company's growth prospects.
<BR>
<DT><B>How does Cabot pick stocks?</B>  
<DD>Cabot's stock selection system starts by focusing on stocks that are strong, going up faster than the general market.  These stocks are said to have positive momentum.  But we need to see more than that.  Behind each stock we want to see a great growth company.  In most cases we require a company to be demonstrating strong growth of both sales and earnings.  And we want to find a story that convinces us this great earnings growth is likely to continue in the years ahead.
<BR>
<DT><B>How does Cabot determine that a stock is strong?</B>  
<DD>We look for stocks with strong relative performance (RP), sometimes called relative strength.  These are stocks performing better than the general market over the long-term.
<BR>
<DT><B>How does Cabot identify a great growth company? </B> 
<DD>In short, we want to see a company that appears capable of multiplying its earnings rapidly.  Characteristics we like to see include a revolutionary product or service, mass markets, high barriers to competition, little or no debt, substantial ownership by management, and large recurring income from products or services.  We prefer small companies because they can grow faster, and we prefer companies that are profitable now.
<BR>
<DT><B>Do all Cabot's stocks go up?</B>  
<DD>No.  No one picks winners all the time.  Sometimes your stocks will go down right after you buy them.  If they do, you should get out of them, keeping your losses small.  On the other hand, you should hold your winners as long as they are doing well, cultivating them with the hope of holding on for the huge profits that can develop over several years time.  In general, we feel we've done a good job if 60% of our stock picks end up as winners.  The key to success is letting the profits in your winners get larger while keeping your losses small.
<BR>
<DT><B>How do I know when to sell?</B>   
<DD>The most important rule in investing. . . . .and the hardest to learn is, "Cut your losses short."  That means if your loss exceeds 15% or 20% at the end of any trading day, you sell.  Period.  On the other hand, you will have many winners, and knowing when to sell them is more difficult.  In general, though, we believe it is wise to sell when a stock has underperformed the market for thirteen weeks.  The stock's RP (relative performance) line is a good indicator of this.
<BR>
<DT><B>Are there times when this rule should be broken?</B>  
<DD>Yes, there are exceptions, in particular involving Heritage Stocks.  These are stocks in which you already have doubled your money. . . . .or more. . . . .and still see the potential for great appreciation in the future.  In such cases, you should hang on to your stock through corrections, confident that the long-term results will prove rewarding.  If you can do this, you'll benefit mightily from the magic of compounding.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is so magic about compounding?</B>  
<DD>All right, it's not really magic.  But when you see the way it can turn a small amount of money into really big money, sometimes it seems like magic.  Consider this example.  You invest $10,000 in a stock.  Its price doubles in a year.  So you sell it, pay your capital gains taxes and invest in another stock.  That one doubles in a year, too.  So you sell it and pay your taxes and buy a third stock that also doubles in a year.  After paying your taxes (assume a 30% rate), you have $27, 440.  Not bad.  But what would happen if you simply hung on to one great stock, letting it triple in value over three years?  You would have $80,000 instead of $27,440.  It would still be growing. . . . .and you haven't paid a cent of taxes.  If you did finally sell the stock and paid your taxes, you would end up with an impressive $56,000.  That's over twice as much as in the first example, and the only difference is that you didn't sell and give your profits to the government.  You held on and your profits kept working for you.  That's the magic of compounding.
In plain English, you might say that money makes money.  And the money that money makes money.  Understanding the power of compounding is one of the keys to real success in the market.
<BR>
<DT><B>Is it smart to take my bet off the table once I double my money?</B>  
<DD>No.  On the surface, it looks like a way to reduce your risk.  And It's true.  You can't lose that money if It's not invested.  But neither can you use it to make more!  If you want to take advantage of the magic of compounding, you've got to leave that money invested. . . . .let your profits run. . . . .until you're convinced the stock's major growth phase is over.
<BR>
<DT><B>Is it risky to buy stocks hitting new highs?</B>  
<DD>In the long run, no.  Remember, a trend, once established, tends to persist.  So if you're convinced a stock's trend is up and you're convinced the business is capable of great earnings growth in the years ahead, you should buy.  Because the most likely trend is up!  At the root of this, you will generally find a shifting change in the public's perception of the company.  We call it sponsorship.  As more and more people come to develop improved opinions of the company, it's natural they will buy more of the stock and drive it to higher prices.  
<BR>
<DT><B>Why are earnings so important?</B>
<DD>Companies are in business to make money.  Thus, earnings are the ultimate score card.  Companies that can grow their earnings rapidly and do it repeatedly see their stock prices rise to reflect their success.  Conversely, companies that stumble on their growth path see the price of their stock fall.  Investors are always looking ahead to what they believe the company's earnings will be in the future.  Thus investors' perceptions of the company's prospects can be as important as the reality. . . . .in the short term.  But in the long run, earnings and earnings per share are most important.  To measure earnings per share, just divide earnings, usually for the last four quarters, by the number of shares of stock outstanding.  If a company reports earnings, or profit, of $5 million in a year and has 10 million shares outstanding, earnings per share (or eps) is $.50.  Remember, you own shares, so if the company can grow earnings while keeping the number of shares constant, the underlying value of your investment has increased.  But if the number of shares increases at the same time, (perhaps the company sells more shares because it needs more cash) the value of your holdings becomes diluted to a degree.  At the extreme, if earnings double but the number of shares also doubles, the underlying value of your investment has not improved.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a price/earnings ratio?</B>  
<DD>If you divide a company's stock price by its earnings per share, you'll come up with a price/earnings ratio, or PE.  This simple number reflects how well-thought-of the stock is by investors.  A single-digit PE is considered to be low, while a number over 20 is considered to be high.  If stocks were commodities, like bananas, a low price/earnings ratio would represent a bargain. . . . .a good value.  But at Cabot a high PE does not keep us from buying a strong stock.  Because stocks are not commodities.  When you buy a stock you are betting that earnings will grow in the future.  And a high PE is simply confirming that other investors as well believe your company will experience fast earnings growth in the future.
<BR>
<DT><B>Are investors always rational?</B>
<DD>No! While the long-term course of a stock's price will ultimately reflect earnings, its short-term course is highly dependent on investors' perceptions. . . . .and their emotions.  Investors, generally, can be motivated by fear or greed.  When they are fearful, they can sell a stock so that its price falls to unreasonably low levels.  And when investors are greedy, they can bid a stock's price up to unreasonable heights.  The challenge for the individual investor is to avoid getting caught up in the emotions of the crowd.
<BR>
<DT><B>Does The Cabot Market Letter ever advocate short-term investing?</B>  
<DD>No. All our recommended investments are made with the hope of holding on for years.  Admittedly, these hopes are not always fulfilled.  A stock can turn down much sooner than we expect, and we will recommend that you sell.  Losses can be hard to take, psychologically.  But they are the price you pay for finding the big winners. . . . .the ones that fulfill your hopes and even exceed them.  In short, you can't get rich with short-term winners.  Only long-term winners, combined with the magic of compounding, will do the trick.  In fact, when you invest for the long-term and you are able to hold the stock of a successful company over a period of years, you benefit from the unforeseeable and the incalculable.  That is, you reap the rewards of progress at the company that was totally unforeseen years before but was brought to fruition by capable management given time to do its work.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is short selling?</B>  
<DD>Short selling is the practice of borrowing shares of a stock so you can sell it (short), planning to buy it back later at a lower price. . . . .returning the shares and keeping the difference in price as your profit.  In brief, you're betting that the price will fall.  At Cabot, we do not recommend the practice, for a couple of good reasons.  First is the long-term trend of the market, which has been generally upward over the decades, even centuries.  When you invest (long) in a stock, you're investing in synch with the long-term trend.  But when you go short, you're betting that the stock you're shorting will move contrary to that long-term, upward market trend.  And you're betting that you're clever enough to time your entry and exit points to catch this move.  It's tricky.  
Equally important is the fact that the potential profits of a short-seller are limited.  If the stock's price falls to zero, the best you can do is double your money.  Contrast that with the potential of a fast-growing company that could triple your money, or more, in a year or two.  Conversely, on the long side the worst you can do is lose all the money you invested in that stock, while if you're short, your potential losses are unlimited!
<BR>
<DT><B>What is investing on margin?</B>  
<DD>Someday your broker may ask if you'd like to invest on margin.  In effect the broker is offering to lend you money so that you can invest it and profit from it.  The broker is a guaranteed winner, because you pay him interest on the money you borrow and he gets the commissions when you trade with that money.  But your profits will be harder to come by.  You've got to pay that interest and those commissions . . . . .and your risk is increased.  If you're doubled up on margin, for example, a simple stock drop of 10% will hand you a loss of 20%!  And a 20% drop will give you a 40% loss plus a headache.  In general, we don't recommend investing on margin.
<BR>
<DT><B>What are options?</B>  
<DD>An option gives you the right to buy or sell shares of a stock if it reaches a specified price by a set date.  On the surface, it seems a relatively inexpensive way to invest, with the promise of a big payoff if you're right.  Trouble is, you'll seldom be right.  Most times, your "investment" will disappear, leaving you with absolutely nothing.  And even if you do have profits, they'll be short-term.  As with short-selling, the argument is that not only must you be right about the direction the stock will move, you also must be right about the time.  It's far simpler and more rewarding to simply invest on the long side, patiently letting time work for you.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a bull market?</B>  
<DD>A bull market is a long period when most stocks are going up in price.  While there are no universally agreed upon methods of determining when a bull market exists, it is without doubt easier to make money in stocks when the major trend is up.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a bear market?</B>  
<DD>A bear market is a long period when most stocks are declining in price.  It's tough to make money in bear markets.  Happily, they tend to be briefer than bull markets.  Over the very long term, the major trend of the market is up.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is market timing?</B>  
<DD>We are strong believers in long-term market timing. . . . .mainly so we can sell stocks and preserve cash when the broad market enters into a major decline.  This is not an exact science.  But it can be tremendously rewarding to avoid losing money.  And we've had great success with market timing over the years.  So we feel confident in recommending that all investors practice it.  On average, The Cabot Market Letter gives one major market timing signal per year.  If it's a sell signal, we work to reduce risk by selling our poorest performing stocks and putting close limits on the others.  The object is to reduce the risk of loss and to raise cash for the next buy signal, when bargains abound.  When that buy signal comes, we invest aggressively in the best-performing stocks we can find.  Interestingly, that's the time most investors are scared to death.
<BR>
<DT><B>Is it risky to invest when public sentiment is negative?</B>  
<DD>To the contrary, that's the best time of all!  The public, in general, tends to react to what has already happened and assumes that the past will continue.  Investors have no way of seeing the end of a trend until it's well behind them.  But we know that all trends end when the last holdout joins the crowd. . . . .when the last buyer buys or the last seller sells.  The trend ends when sentiment reaches an extreme level.  Then, because all the fuel for that trend is exhausted, the trend reverses.  In general, the better you are at gauging the mood of the crowd,  the more confident you will feel about buying when all about you have sold in panic. . . . .and moving to the sidelines when all about you are buying feverishly.

<H2>Cabot's Two-Second Indicator</H2>

<P>
When we open the financial section of our newspaper every morning,
we look at one number first. This is the most important number
we look at all day. The smaller that number the better we like
it. And it takes us only two seconds to check it. That's why we
call this new indicator Cabot's Two-Second Indicator!
<P>
This new indicator, unlike any other market timing indicator we
know of, answers the question, &quot;How healthy is the stock
market today?&quot; When you use it, you are simply taking the
temperature of the stock market. All you have to do is glance
in your newspaper and note the number of stocks on the NYSE that
hit new 52-week price lows for the previous day. This single number,
when properly interpreted, will give you a very good idea of the
health of the current stock market.
<P>
Is this indicator perfect? No. No timing indicator is infallible,
and we never expect to find one that's perfect. Nevertheless,
we have found a strong correlation between the number of daily
new lows and the health of the stock market itself. Essentially
we see that as long as the number of daily new lows does not exceed
40, the market is sound and in no danger of falling significantly.

<P>
In sum, the indicator is most helpful during normal markets and
at market tops. But in addition, at market bottoms this indicator
can help you identify the reduced selling that takes place before
the next major market advance.
<P>
As a result of our research, we have been able to divide the stock
market into three distinct categories of varying degrees of strength
or weakness. Here are the categories:
<H4>CATEGORY ONE - A ROBUST MARKET</H4>

<P>
This type of market is the strongest and typically has no days
of 40 or more new lows. Even on market corrections of 100 Dow
points or more, no 40 readings occur. This is an exceedingly healthy
market on a safe footing. When the daily new low readings are
consistently fewer than 40, it's impossible for the stock market
to drop significantly. 
<H4>CATEGORY TWO - A HEALTHY MARKET</H4>

<P>
This type of market, while not as strong as the one identified
above, is nevertheless a healthy market. And it is more typical
of what we see in an advancing market. Sometimes this type of
market can be quite strong and yet interspersed with corrections
that have reasonably short periods (one to twenty days) of 40
or more new lows. In this category the 40 reading doesn't appear
until the market correction has been in force for a few days.
So these occasional pockets of 40 readings are not worrisome.
They occur around the bottom of a normal correction. And the selling
pressures ease rather quickly if the market is basically healthy.
In fact, the subsequent shrinkage to readings of fewer than 40
can be considered a good buying point for stocks.
<H4>CATEGORY THREE - A SICK AND DANGEROUS MARKET</H4>

<P>
Do not underestimate the danger of this market! If you are aware
of only this category and take defensive action when it first
appears, you will be extremely well rewarded. In these cases we
observe that as the market advances to a new market peak or a
sub-peak, the daily new lows start expanding simultaneously to
produce readings of 40 or more, day after day. DANGER, DANGER,
DANGER!!!! Internally, the real market is heading down, producing
a dangerous number of new lows day after day, even though the
Dow is hitting new peaks and even though the daily new highs might
be expanding! A sell signal is flashed as soon as five consecutive
days of readings in excess of 40 new lows are registered. The
Category Three market remains in effect as long as the new lows
remain greater than 40. 
<P>
To conclude that the Category Three decline has truly reached
its end, we like to see a retest of the market bottom with the
daily new lows at reduced levels followed by at least four days
of fewer than 40 new lows in an advancing market.
<H4>REVIEW OF CABOT'S TWO-SECOND INDICATOR</H4>

<P>
Probably the best way for you to understand this indicator is
to look at some history. The detailed comments show you how you
could have spotted each of these new market trends, not in hindsight,
but in real time, as it was developing. You'll find one example
of Category One, one example of Category Two and then eight examples
of Category Three. This is the category of greatest interest because
it helps you to identify market tops as they occur. It warns you
of serious market declines and even of impending market panics
such as the one of October, 1987.
<H4>A ROBUST MARKET<BR>
Category One, 1991</H4>

<P>
1991 was a typically bullish year in which the Two-Second Indicator
repeatedly signaled that the stock market was healthy and there
was nothing to worry about. The new lows remained at fewer than
40 throughout the entire year except for five trading days in
the middle of January when the market was going through a normal
correction, one day in August when Gorbachev of Russia was ousted
for a day, and then in late November and December when the market
was correcting again. (These year-end corrections could be considered
Category Two configurations.) The year 1983 provided us with another
good example of a Category One configuration. In that year, no
new lows in excess of 40 appeared until December, and that was
during a market correction. There were only nine recorded days
of more than 40 new lows in 1983.
<H4>A HEALTHY MARKET<BR>
Category Two, 1992</H4>

<P>
In 1992 the Two-Second Indicator produced readings of less than
40 throughout the year except on 35 trading days. And those 35
trading days occurred during five distinct market corrections.
There were two in April at the bottom of the correction. There
were seven in June, during a correction. Two in July during market
weakness. Two in August during a sell-off. And finally, beginning
in September and extending into November, there was a series of
days of more than 40 new lows (22 days in all). These 40 or more
readings kept appearing and then disappearing during the September-November
market correction. But the new lows never expanded. Ever-so-slowly
they started drying up and then eventually disappeared. This is
a good example of Category Two, a reasonably healthy market that
is frequently interspersed with reasonable market corrections,
none of a damaging nature. You would have been safely and profitably
investing throughout the entire year.
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1962</H4>

<P>
In January of 1962 the Dow had just hit record highs of 725 in
the Dow, had corrected and was advancing again in March, just
a handful of points short of the January record highs. The daily
new lows were substantially fewer than 40, without exception.
On March 15 the market peaked at 723. On the 18th, with the Dow
at 720, the daily new lows exceeded 40, and then day after day
kept getting larger and larger. We were witnessing Category Three
unfolding. The market was right at its highs and yet the daily
new lows started expanding. We were able to record five consecutive
days of 40-or-greater readings by the time the market dropped
to 714 in the Dow, on March 25th. This flashed a sell signal.
Fundamentally, there was news to precipitate the weak market that
developed in late March and April. President Kennedy had confronted
the steel industry and forced the steel companies to rescind their
recent price hikes. The stock market took this badly. The Dow
Industrials dropped from 723 to 535 (a huge drop of 26%) in little
more than three months' time.
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1966</H4>

<P>
In February of 1966, the Dow Industrials were hitting a new record
high at 995, breaking up through the previous highs of mid-January.
But surprisingly, only one day after that peak, with the Dow slipping
only five points, the new lows expanded to 50 and continued to
expand. That was the first day of a whole series of days until
November, where 97% of all the readings exceeded 40 day after
day. The sell signal was flashed at Dow 973, only six days after
the yearly market high was recorded in mid-February. This was
clearly a Category Three sell signal. The market skidded and dived
throughout the year, dropping from Dow 995 in February to 745
in early October, a drop of 25%. It was a great year to be anywhere
but the stock market!
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1970</H4>

<P>
1970 witnessed the daily new lows expanding rapidly in January,
but not until a correction was well under way (Category Two).
Then, as the market advanced again into early April, the new lows
shrunk, as expected, to below 40, but only briefly, actually for
six days. Then, while the Dow was resting at its market peak of
Dow 790, the new lows started to expand dramatically with the
first reading in excess of 40 occurring four days prior to the
market's ultimate peak. This was a weak situation and spelled
danger for the market. The fifth consecutive reading of excessive
new lows occurred right at the exact market top in mid-April,
producing a market sell signal. This coincided with the liquidity
crisis that occurred at that time. The market plummeted from the
Dow 790 area to 630 in less than two months. That amounted to
a shocking 20% drop. 
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three 1973</H4>

<P>
In 1973, as the Dow hit record highs of 1050 in mid-January, the
daily new lows started expanding and exceeded 40 on the very first
day following that all-time Dow peak. That was a bad sign, indicating
that the market was getting pneumonia. A market sell signal was
flashed at Dow 1000 on January 25, after five consecutive days
were registered. The new lows remained in excess of 40 until September.
In those eight months the market plummeted from Dow 1050 to 853,
for a loss of 19%.
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1974</H4>

<P>
In 1974, as the Dow advanced to a new high for the year (in March
at Dow 890) the new lows started to expand and a short four days
after that peak the new lows were 50. This was a bad sign, new
lows expanding to beyond 40 just four days after the peak in the
Dow was being reached. The sell signal was flashed in late March
with the Dow at 870, only 20 points off its peak. These new lows
continued to expand day after day, remaining in excess of 40 until
October. The market was in a shambles. The Dow had collapsed from
Dow 890 to 585 in less than seven months. The Dow drop amounted
to a gigantic 34%. 
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1980</H4>

<P>
In 1980, the big market drop lasted only six weeks, but a lot
of damage was done in that time. However, the daily new lows exceeded
40 for six days <I>before</I> the market top of Dow 900 in mid-February.
The indicator gave a sell signal one day before the market peak.
And the new lows continued to expand day after day. The new lows
finally reached an extreme of 698 at the end of March before drying
up rapidly. The drop in the Dow from 900 to 760 amounted to a
16% plunge.
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1987</H4>

<P>
1987 provided the record market crash of modern times. The year
started out bullishly enough with very few daily new lows for
the first three months. In the April-May market correction, the
new lows expanded beyond 40 just near the bottoms of the several
pullbacks (Category Two). Then the Dow advanced to new all-time
peaks in August to Dow 2722. And the daily new lows looked fine.
We had a normal correction in September where the new lows expanded
to beyond 40. Then the Dow started advancing again, moving up
to 2640 over a period of two weeks. But on this 150-point advance,
as the daily new lows tried to contract to below 40 they failed
to do so, with the exception of one day in early October, just
one day before the peak. Then the new lows exceeded 40 again,
the Dow started dropping, and the new lows started expanding sharply!
After five days, this indicator gave a sell signal. And you had
about six more trading days to act before the crash occurred.
From the October peak of Dow 2640 to the close of 1841 on October
20, we saw a market drop of 30%. The new lows expanded sharply
to a gigantic 1175 on that nightmarish October day. 
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1990</H4>

<P>
Before the bear market started in July, there was a Category Two
configuration in January, extending into February. The market
then rallied up to 2760 in mid-April, and this indicator flashed
a sell signal as the new lows persisted at more than 40 for five
straight days. But this signal proved to be premature since the
market strengthened and went ahead to about Dow 2909 in June with
the new lows drying up. Then there was another normal pull back
in late June. But as the market rallied again to a new all-time
peak in July just short of Dow 3000, the daily new lows failed
to shrink from the June correction. They remained in excess of
the 40 level. This was a bad sign, because the Dow was clearly
above its peaks of early June and yet the daily new lows were
running between the 40 and 60 level, a very unhealthy situation.
That was a clear-cut sell signal. The new lows kept expanding
as the market started a correction. Thirteen trading days after
the market peaked (it was down 150 points by then) news arrived
that Iraq had invaded Kuwait. The market rout was under way and
it wasn't until mid-October that the market bottomed at Dow 2360.
Thus, the market drop amounted to 21%, a serious decline. 
<P>
Now, after reviewing these details, you have a better understanding
of how you can use this indicator for more profitable investing.
Of course, no indicator is infallible. That's why we strongly
advise that you use this Two-Second Indicator in conjunction with
Cabot's other indicators, such as the Power Index and the daily
Advance-Decline Line of stocks on the NYSE.

<H4>IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF <BR>
CABOT'S TWO-SECOND INDICATOR</H4>

<P>
1. Every day, it gives you a simple, unbiased reading of the health
of the stock market.<BR>
2. It is extremely broad-based, involving the entire NYSE.<BR>
3. It is a specific reading of what the stock market itself is
doing. It is not some secondary or tertiary indicator, such as
the economy, or interest rates, or employment rates or inflation
rates.<BR>
4. This indicator gives you an ongoing picture of the general
health of the market. When there are no or very few daily lows
in excess of 40, you know it's a robust market. When the daily
new lows begin to exceed 40 in the depths of a market correction,
you know it's still a healthy market, and you should remain invested
or even take advantage of the buying opportunity.<BR>
5. With this indicator, you can identify market tops as they occur.
As a general rule, when the Dow Industrial Average advances strongly
for roughly two weeks to a month to a new peak or a sub-peak and
is accompanied at the top by five continuous days of daily new
low readings in excess of 40, it's a sign of danger ahead in the
stock market. The earlier the five readings occur, the more dangerous
the situation!

<H2>A New Year...But It's The Same Old Bull Market!</H2>
</center>
Yes, it's a new year!  And we never cease to wonder at the number of
predictions of where the stock market will be a year from now.  Why so many
predictions?
<P>
<center><h3>Cabot's Model Portfolio</h3></center>
<P>
One of our stocks split two-for-one... This company is a leader in the
business of providing high-speed digital access to the Internet.  Carlton
Lutts is averaging up on Cabot's Strongest Stock.
<P>
<CENTER><h3>Cabot's Market Timing</h3></CENTER>
<P>
The CABOT TREND LINES, remains positive, as it has been for the entire 1996
year . . . . . . yes, even during the July sell-off.  We remain bullish,
long-term, and we recommend full investment now.
<P>
<CENTER><h3>Imagine You're An Intelligent Farmer . . .</h3></CENTER>
<P>
Many decades ago we read a science fiction novel about the state of the
world, post-apocalypse.  Vegetation in the recovering world was so scarce
that when a roving band of survivors found a thin crop of corn, tended by a
solitary settler, they quickly devoured the shoots, leaving nothing but
dirt.  Understandable, perhaps, given the circumstances.  But how much
better they would have fared had they had the patience to wait for the
ripening of the real crop!
<P>
Imagine a farmer growing corn in Iowa today.  He plants various seeds in
various fields.  The crops in some fields, of course, develop faster than
others.  But if he's an intelligent farmer, he expects this.  And he knows
it would be the ultimate in foolishness to go out and harvest the small,
developing ears of corn in his best-performing fields in the early days of
their growth.
<P>
Yet this is what many investors do!  They buy a stock, believing it has the
potential to make them big money.  Then as soon as it increases 30%, 50% or
100% they go out and sell it!  To us, it's the ultimate in foolishness!
What these investors should be doing, if they want to make really big money
in the market, is buying more of their best performers.
<P>
By emphasizing your winners and maintaining a long-term attitude, you can
put yourself in a position to take advantage of the magic of compounding.
This way, your profits continue to work for you instead of for the tax man!

<H3>Still wondering what we can do for you?<BR>
Let one of our satisfied subscribers tell you!</H3>

<P>
Dear Mr. Lutts:
<P>
This is the kind of letter I prefer to write -- and the kind I'm sure you receive often! (Have you guessed already that I am another happy subscriber to your stock advisory?)
You've seen the brochures from those "experts" that I now classify as "all the others", blatantly announcing that X's newsletter is the best, and reciting endless testimonials from a few mysterious (ever try to contact any of them?) subscribers stating that they've... "tried them all, but (X's) is the best!"
<P>
Well, Mr. Lutts, I really have tried all of the better ones -- and while I admit that I'm sometimes difficult to please, not one of those other letters can hold a candle to yours. Not one. Period.
<P>
Before I invested one cent in your stock choices, I read your advisory for a full year. I watched the market very closely, and compared your findings to daily movements. At the end of that year it was obvious that your indicators were absolutely 100% on target, 100% of the time, and that your recommendations were by far the most accurate of any available. Only then did I begin investing based on your suggestions. And I have not been disappointed, not once. Your service really is a service. I especially like the RP line and the Two Second Timer. And because I have found that basing one's investments on flimsy advice in today's market is both dumb and unnecessary, I am a subscriber for life. Please keep up your great work!
Very truly yours,
<P>

<CENTER><H3>Who We Are</H3></CENTER>
Conceptus is dedicated to addressing the serious needs in reproductive medicine that affect so many patients today. Our initial focus is on improving the diagnosis and treatment of fallopian tube disorders, a major cause of female infertility.
<TABLE width=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>
<TR>
<TD>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="bigeyes.gif" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=180></CENTER>
</TD></TABLE>


In the last twenty years, there has been an increase in the number of couples diagnosed as infertile, and fallopian tube disorders are implicated in over 35% of these cases. Many of the life style changes of the last two decades are thought to be at least partially responsible for increasing rates of infertility. The tendency for women to defer childbearing in order to establish careers outside the home, for example, has contributed to increasing rates of female infertility because a women at 35 is statistically three times as likely to be infertile as a women of 25.
<P>
Due to the anatomical position of the fallopian tubes, accessing the tubes in order to facilitate diagnosis and treatment has been difficult and often necessitated invasive surgical techniques. Recently, tremendous strides have been made in the development of device technology that allows non-surgical access to remote areas of the body, facilitating less-invasive diagnosis and treatment. Devices, such as micro-catheters and small telescopes, are commonly used in cardiology, gastrointestinal, peripheral vascular and neuro procedures. Many of us at Conceptus were a part of this dramatic change in the way medicine is practiced and we want to see the same patient benefits brought to reproductive medicine. 
<P>
Conceptus mission is to bring this proven medical device technology to reproductive medicine, develop technology where it doesnt exist , and modify and optimize existing technologies for routine use in identifying and treating common reproductive disorders.
<P>
The Company has developed proprietary micro-catheters, smaller than the lead in a pencil, and tiny guidewire systems to allow physicians the ability to access and navigate the proximal end of the fallopian tube (near the uterus) in a non-surgical approach. These devices are inserted through the natural opening of the vagina, into the cervical canal and across the uterus to enter the tubal opening. We believe that our fallopian tube access system facilitates a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of tubal diseases and disorders than conventional diagnostic methods, which are known to be inaccurate. More importantly, we believe that a more accurate  diagnosis will lead to more appropriate infertility therapy, providing the patient with a better result. Our first catheter system for fallopian tube catheterization was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States in 1995. Data from physicians performing tubal catheterization procedures using our catheter system indicate many patients can be spared the trauma and expense of more invasive surgical procedures such as tubal surgery and/or in-vitro fertilization.
<P>
We at Conceptus are also excited about the potential application currently under investigation of our tubal access catheters and other related devices to perform a non-surgical, permanent contraception procedure to replace surgical tubal ligation, the most common form of "birth control."  Stay tuned as we evolve the applications of our unique catheter access products and develop new technologies to expand your options in reproductive medicine.

The Conceptus Soft Seal Cervical Catheter is designed for atraumatic, transcervical access to the uterus.  During use, the latex balloon is inflated with an air filled syringe to seal the cervical canal.  A two-way stopcock located on the inflation port maintains the balloon volume.  The Soft Seal Cervical Catheter has a luer lock port at the proximal end for easy injection of dye.</TD>

Conceptus' Soft Torque Uterine Catheters are designed to allow easy, accurate placement at the tubal ostium.  The Soft Torque's distal portion is curved for accurate placement.  Multiple curve options accommodate a variety of anatomies and cervical catheter positions.<P>
The Soft Torque Uterine Catheter is 46 cm in length and has an outer diameter of 6 F.  A soft, radiopaque tip and a radiopaque shaft allow visualization of the catheter under fluoroscopy and assists in the placement of the catheter in the uterus.  A large 1.4 mm inner diameter facilitates easy injection of contrast, dye or washed sperm.</TD>

<H3>The Fallopian Tube</H3>
<P>
The fallopian tube has the complex task of ensuring the transport  of spermatozoa towards the ovary, and of ova towards the uterus. In addition, it supports the changes in the gametes which lead to fertilization, embryo cleavage and transport of the zygote towards the normal site of implantation in the uterine endometrium. The fallopian tube is far more than just a conduit between the ovaries and the uterus; its finger-like ciliated cells that line the tubal lumen must be healthy in order to assist sperm in their migration toward the ovum, and, if conception occurs, to reverse the direction of movement to propel the newly-fertilized ovum toward the uterus. In addition, the secretory cells must be functioning to create the chemical environment necessary to achieve fertilization.
<P>
The fallopian tubes are delicate and difficult to access because they are very narrow, tortuous and convoluted in shape.   As a result, they do not lend themselves to easy study and treatment. Because of the difficulty in accessing the fallopian tubes, current non-surgical techniques for diagnosing fallopian tube diseases and disorders often do not adequately or accurately delineate the nature, extent and location of tubal pathology. Therapeutic choices for the treatment of infertility are equally constrained by the difficulty in accessing the fallopian tubes, and therefore, most fallopian tube therapies must be performed surgically. 
<P>
		<H3>Tubal Factor Infertility</H3>
<P>
Human reproductive diseases and disorders are increasingly common medical problems in most developed countries. Infertility is one of the most common and emotionally traumatic of reproductive disorders. In most countries, female infertility appears to be increasing, both because of the increase in diseases which damage the fallopian tubes, such as sexually transmitted diseases, and because of the increasing tendency of women to defer child-bearing until later in life, when fertility begins to decline naturally. Studies indicate that approximately five to eight million couples in the United States or up to 15% of couples of child-bearing age (20-44) are clinically infertile.

<A NAME="artificial insemination"></A>
<P>
<B>Artificial Insemination (AI)</B>--- Placing sperm into the vagina, uterus
through artificial means instead of by coitus --- usually injected through a catheter or cannula after being washed. This procedure is used for both donor (AID) and husband's (AIH) sperm. This technique is used to overcome sexual performance problems, to circumvent sperm-mucusinteraction problems, to maximize the potential for poor semen, and for using donor sperm.

The tissue may attach itself to the reproductive organs or to other organs in the abdominal cavity. Each month the endometrial tissue inbreeds with the onset of menses. The resultant irritation causes <A HREF="#adhesions">adhesions</A> in the abdominal cavity and in the <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tubes</A>. Endometriosis may also interfere with ovulation and with the <A HREF="#implantation">implantation</A> of the <A HREF="#embryo">embryo</A>. 

<A NAME="endometrium"></A>
<P>
<B>Endometrium</B>--- The lining of the <A HREF="#uterus">uterus</A> which grows and sheds in response to estrogen and progesterone stimulation; the bed of tissue designed to nourish the <A HREF="#implantation">implanted</A> <A HREF="#embryo">embryo</A>. 

<A NAME="fallopian"></A>
<P>
<B>Fallopian Tubes</B>--- Ducts through which eggs travel to the <A HREF="#uterus">uterus</A> once released from the follicle. <A HREF="#sperm">Sperm</A> normally meet the egg in the <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tube</A>, the site at which <A HREF="#fertilization">fertilization</A> usually occurs.

<A NAME="fertility treatment"></A>
<P>
<B>Fertility Treatment</B>--- Any method or procedure used to enhance fertility or increase the
likelihood of pregnancy, such as ovulation induction treatment, varicocoele repair, and
microsurgery to repair damaged <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tubes</A>. The goal of fertility treatment is to help couples have a child. 

<A NAME="fertility specialist"></A>
<P>
<B>Fertility Specialist</B>--- A physician specializing in the practice of fertility. The American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology certifies a subspecialty for OB-GYNs who receive extra training in endocrinology (the study of hormones) and infertility. Those who acquire certification are Reproductive Endocrinologists (REs). 

<A NAME="fertilization"></A>
<P>
<B>Fertilization</B>--- The combining of the genetic material carried by <A HREF="#sperm">sperm</A> and egg to create an
<A HREF="#embryo">embryo</A>. Normally occurs inside the <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tube</A> (in vivo) but may also occur in a petri dish (in vitro). See also <A HREF="#ivf">In Vitro Fertilization</A>. 

<A NAME="fimbria"></A>
<P>
<B>Fimbria</B>--- Finger-like projections at the end of the <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tube</A> nearest the ovary. When
stimulated by the follicular fluid released during ovulation, the fingerlike ends grasp the ovary and coax the egg into the tube. 

<A NAME="gamete"></A>
<P>
<B>Gamete</B>--- A reproductive cell: <A HREF="#sperm">Sperm</A> in men, the egg in women. 


<A NAME="gonorrhea"></A>
<P>
<B>Gonorrhea</B>--- A sexually transmitted bacterial infection with a special propensity to cause tubal damage and infertility.

<A NAME="hydrosalpinx"></A>
<P>
<B>Hydrosalpinx</B>--- A large, fluid-filled <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tube</A> that results when the end of the tube is closed as a result of infection or inflammation.

<A NAME="hydrotubation"></A>
<P>
<B>Hydrotubation</B>--- Injection of fluid, often into the <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tubes</A> to determine if they are 
open. (see <A HREF="#chromopertubation">chromopertubation</A>)

<A NAME="hsg"></A>
<P>
<B>Hysterosalpinogram (HSG)</B>--- An x-ray of the pelvic organs in which a radio-opaque dye is injected through the <A HREF="#cervix">cervix</A> into the <A HREF="#uterus">uterus</A> and <A HREF="#fallopian">fallopian tubes</A>. This test checks for malformations of the uterus and blockage of the fallopian tubes. 

<A NAME="hysteroscopy"></A>
<P>
<B>Hysteroscopy</B>--- A procedure in which the doctor checks for uterine abnormalities by inserting a fiber-optic device. Minor surgical repairs can be executed during the procedure. 

<A NAME="implantation"></A>
<P>
<B>Implantation (Embryo)</B>--- The embedding of the <A HREF="#embryo">embryo</A> into tissue so it can establish contact with the mother's blood supply for nourishment. Implantation usually occurs in the lining of the <A HREF="#uterus">uterus</A>; however, in an <A HREF="#ectopic">ectopic pregnancy</A> it may occur elsewhere in the body. 

<A NAME="infertiliity"></A>
<P>

<h2>Conceptus Sponsored Clinical Trial Compares New Falloposcopy Procedure to Standard Method in Diagnosing Infertility</h2>
<h3>Gynecologist Presents Findings at Meeting of American Society of Reproductive Medicine</h3>
<!-- textstart -->
<p>
           SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 1996-- Conceptus Inc., (NASDAQ: CPTS)   announced today the presentation of results from
an International Multicenter Study on Falloposcopy (FSC) for the 
diagnosis of fallopian tube infertility at the annual meeting of the 
American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).  
<p>
           As presented by Stefan Rimbach, M.D., of the University of 
Heidelberg, Germany, in the 315 patients analyzed at the time of the 
meeting, visualization of the fallopian tube was successful in more 
than 80 percent of those tubes which could be catheterized using 
falloposcopy.  In falloposcopy, a new diagnostic method to directly 
image the interior of the fallopian tube, a physician first 
introduces a unique flexible catheter into the fallopian tube.  The 
3,000 imaging fibers of the flexible fallopian tube endoscope 
(falloposcope) then enable physicians to image the lumen of the 
fallopian tube by gently withdrawing the catheter and the 
falloposcope through the full length of the tube.  
<p>
           In nearly 70 percent of the cases, falloposcopy corrected false 
information or provided additional clinical information when compared
to the conventional diagnostic methods hysterosalpingography (HSG) 
and chromolaparoscopy (LSC).  The study also showed a complication 
rate of less than four percent.  
<p>
           Fallopian tube disorders are a major cause of infertility; 
studies indicate that 35 percent of female infertility in the United 
States is attributable in whole or part to fallopian tube disorders 
(Source: ASRM).  A diagnosis of tubal disorders often leads to costly
and invasive treatments, such as open tubal surgery or in-vitro 
fertilization with embryo transfer (IVF).  Inaccurate infertility 
diagnosis can further delay the application of appropriate treatment,
a major problem for those women whose fertility status is already 
compromised by age.  
<p>
           The International Multicenter Study of Falloposcopy, sponsored by
Conceptus, involves 21 centers in Europe and Australia and was 
initiated in 1994 by Dr. Rimbach, Prof. Wallwiener and Prof.  
Bastert (University of Heidelberg, Germany).  To date, 371 patients 
have been enrolled in this study using the Company's falloposcopy 
system, known as STARRT (Selective Tubal Assessment to Refine 
Reproductive Therapy).  
<p>
           In October 1995, Conceptus filed a 510(k) for use of its STARRT 
System in the diagnosis of proximal tubal occlusion (PTO).  The 
Company re-filed its 510(k) with updated clinical data in June of 
1996.  In September 1996, the Company received a letter from the U.S.
Food &amp; Drug Administration stating the Agency's determination that 
falloposcopy devices used to evaluate PTO will be reviewed for 
marketing through the 510(k) process instead of the more lengthy PMA 
process.  
<p>
           Also in September 1996, Conceptus received a request from the FDA
for additional data regarding the re-filed 510(k) and the Company 
filed the additional data in October, 1996.  The re-filed 510(k) 
application is currently pending review at the FDA.  Outside of the 
U.S., Conceptus has obtained the necessary regulatory approvals for 
sale of its STARRT System in most of western Europe, Canada, Israel, 
Australia and South Africa, and is seeking approvals to sell its 
products in other countries.  
<p>
           Conceptus, Inc. designs, develops and markets innovative medical
devices that provide minimally invasive access to the female 
reproductive system.  The Company's initial focus is on the 
development of systems to improve the diagnosis and treatment of 
fallopian tube diseases.  The Company is also developing a 
non-surgical approach to fallopian tube sterilization, the most 
commonly performed contraceptive procedure worldwide.

<h2>Conceptus Acquires Microgyn, Developer of Therapeutic Hysteroscopy Devices</h2>
<!-- textstart -->
<p>
    SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 2, 1996-- Conceptus Inc (NASDAQ:CPTS)  today announced that it has completed the acquisition 
of Microgyn, Inc., a private medical device company, for a 
combination of cash and common stock.    
<p>
           Microgyn is focused on developing products to increase the safety
and performance of resectoscope procedures, including therapeutic 
hysteroscopy.  The acquisition is to be accounted for on a purchase 
basis.  Significantly all of the $4 million fixed portion of the 
purchase price is expected to be accounted for as in-process 
research and development and expensed in the fourth quarter of 1996.
<p>
    Therapeutic hysteroscopy is one of the most rapidly growing 
procedures in gynecology to treat uterine disorders which may result 
in recurrent pregnancy loss, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and 
pelvic pain.  This procedure can often provide a less invasive 
alternative to hysterectomy, or the removal of the uterus, which 
is an invasive surgical procedure performed approximately 600,000 
times each year in the United States.
<p>
    &quot;Microgyn's technology provides Conceptus another platform from 
which to broaden our product portfolio for the interventional 
gynecologist,&quot; commented Kathryn Tunstall, President and CEO of 
Conceptus.  &quot;Significantly, Microgyn's hysteroscopy-based products 
are highly complementary to our core catheter technologies, 
providing what we believe will be improved clinical solutions which 
are less invasive and more cost effective.&quot;  
<p>
           Conceptus's Transcervical Tubal Access Catheter (T-TAC) system, 
consisting of proprietary microcatheters and guidewires, enables more
direct and accurate diagnosis of diseases of the uterus and fallopian
tubes.  T-TAC also forms the basis for the company's Transcervical 
Falloposcopy system (incorporating specialized fallopian tube 
microendoscopy products) and the S/TOP (Selective Tubal Occlusion 
Procedure) System for nonsurgical female sterilization.  
<p>
    &quot;We share Conceptus's vision of creating a company dedicated to 
developing innovative clinically valuable products for the diagnosis 
and treatment of the gynecologic patient,&quot; stated Keith Isaacson, 
M.D., co-founder of Microgyn and a recognized expert in 
hysteroscopy.  &quot;We are pleased to be part of a broad effort to 
transform the practice of interventional gynecology, a previously 
underserved area of medicine, though the creation of new 
technologies specific to gynecologic applications.&quot;
<p>
    Microgyn's lead product, the continuous-flow Isotonic Solution 
System (CISS), is designed to permit the use of isotonic, or 
physiologic, fluids during hysteroscopic procedures.  Today, these 
procedures require the use of hypotonic fluids, the absorption of 
which can lead to a number of clinical complications, including 
death.  Microgyn filed a 510(k) application for the system in June 
1996.  The CISS is compatible with the large installed base of 
existing hysteroscope systems and electrosurgical generators.  
Microgyn is also developing other related products that are intended 
to further improve the performance of hysteroscopy.
<p>
    Conceptus, Inc. designs, develops and markets innovative, 
minimally invasive medical devices for the interventional gynecology 
market.  The company's initial focus is on the development of 
systems to improve the diagnosis and treatment of uterine and 
fallopian tube diseases and disorders.  The Company is also 
developing a nonsurgical approach to fallopian tube sterilization, 
the most commonly performed contraceptive procedure worldwide.
<p>
    Except for the historical information contained herein, the 
matters discussed in this press release are forward-looking 
statements, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks 
and uncertainties.  The clinical efficacy of and market demand for 
products and receipt of regulatory approvals among other matters 
discussed in this release, may differ significantly from the
discussion of such matters in the forward-looking statements.  
Actual results may be affected by, among other things, risk and 
uncertainties related to new product development and introduction 
cycles, research and development activities, delays by regulatory 
authorities, scientific advances by Conceptus or third parties, 
introduction of competitive products, third party reimbursement and 
physician training, as well as those factors set forth in the 
Company's prospectus, dated February 1, 1996.

<h2>Early Results of the Conceptus Non-Surgical Sterilization System Provided at Meeting of RSNA</h2>


SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 2, 1996--Conceptus 
Inc. (NASDAQ:CPTS) announced today the presentation of pre-clinical 
results as well as early clinical data from the Company's trials of 
its non-surgical sterilization system, termed Selective Tubal 
Occlusion Procedure, or S/TOP System.  To date, 28 patients 
undergoing a hysterectomy on the same day had the Conceptus S/TOP 
device implanted.  As presented at the annual meeting of the
Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), eighty-three percent 
of the fallopian tubes that could be accessed in the 
hysteroscopically aided procedure resulted in successful placement 
of the S/TOP System's metal coils.
<p>
 Hysteroscopic and x-ray guidance were used in pre-clinical 
studies which demonstrated that S/TOP was 100 percent successful in 
preventing conception when Conceptus' devices were placed correctly 
and remained in the fallopian tubes of rabbits.  "Each year, more 
than five million women around the world undergo tubal ligation, the 
current surgical sterilization procedure," said Amy S. Thurmond, 
M.D., Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Oregon Health
Sciences University and an early pioneer of the research that led to 
the development of the S/TOP System. "A non-surgical alternative 
that is both effective and without serious complications will have 
significant advantages to already overburdened public health 
programs."  
  <p>
   Dr. Thurmond added, "In the United States, almost half of the 
married women 35 years or older have undergone a surgical fallopian tube 
sterilization, primarily due to the limitations of other methods of 
contraception.
  <p>
   Conceptus' S/TOP System is designed to provide a non-surgical 
approach to fallopian tube sterilization, the most common method of 
permanent contraception worldwide.  This System is intended to be 
permanent, to be performed in the physician's office, and to require 
minimal recovery time.  Original developers of the Company's S/TOP 
System include Dr. Thurmond, Julian Nikolchev, Conceptus's Chief 
Technical Officer, and a team of engineers at Conceptus.  
   <p>
  Upon insertion, the S/TOP System's medical grade metal coils are 
designed to alter the architecture of the fallopian tube lumen and 
impede their normal function, including the movement of egg and 
sperm, thereby preventing pregnancy.  Transcervical device placement 
in the fallopian tubes is being evaluated with hysteroscopic, 
ultrasound or x-ray guidance and Conceptus' proprietary non-surgical 
tubal access technology.
 <p>
    "There is a significant pent-up demand for an alternative method 
of female sterilization especially for one that does not require 
hospitalization or abdominal incisions.  I am confident that S/TOP 
will be an effective method of sterilization," said Jay Cooper, 
M.D., OB/GYN Consultants, Ltd., Phoenix Baptist Medical Center, 
Phoenix, Arizona, and principal investigator of Conceptus' S/TOP 
System.
  <p>
   In September of 1995, Conceptus initiated its clinical trial 
program with tests of its S/TOP System in women undergoing same-day 
hysterectomy.  Recently, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration granted 
approval of an IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) to initiate an 
additional trial for patients who will undergo placement of 
Conceptus's sterilization coil in each fallopian tube six to twelve 
weeks prior to hysterectomy.  In vivo device stability and mechanism 
of action will be evaluated.
   <p>
  Conceptus, Inc. designs, develops and markets innovative, 
minimally invasive medical devices for the interventional gynecology 
market.  The Company's initial focus is on the development of 
systems to improve the diagnosis and treatment of uterine and fallopian
tube diseases and disorders.
  <p>
   Except for the historical information contained herein, the 
matters discussed in this press release are forward-looking 
statements, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks 
and uncertainties.  The receipt of regulatory approvals and clinical 
efficacy of and market demand for products, among other matters 
discussed in this release, may differ significantly from the
discussion of such matters in the forward-looking statements.  
Actual results may be affected by, among other things, risk and 
uncertainties related to new product development and introduction 
cycles, research and development activities, delays by regulatory 
authorities, scientific advances by Conceptus or third parties, 
introduction of competitive products, third party reimbursement and 
physician training, as well as those factors set forth in the 
Company's prospectus, dated February 1, 1996.

<H3><IMG SRC="pto.gif" ALT="PTO" WIDTH=54 HEIGHT=35>Proximal Tubal Occlusion</H3>
Fallopian tube disease is an important contributing factor in 30% to 40% of couples with infertility. Proximal tubal obstruction is the cause in approximately 10% to 20% of these women. Proximal tubal obstruction may result from a variety of causes such as spasm, amorphous "plugs," salpingitis isthmica nodosa, fibrosis, or endometriosis. Traditional therapy for proximal tubal obstruction is invasive and costly, requiring laparoscopy with chromopertubation to confirm obstruction, followed by open surgery to cut out the occluded segment and reattach the two ends of the fallopian tube.
<P>
Recently, less invasive techniques using <A HREF="selinj.html">selective salpingography</A> and transcervical <A HREF="diagtube.html">tubal catheterization</A> have been developed to better diagnose proximal tubal obstruction.  Approximately 40% of tubes that appear occluded by HSG are found to have proximal patency after a selective salpingography. The placement of small catheters directly in the proximal fallopian tube with selective injection of contrast agent allows the physician to overcome tubal spasm (reflex closure) and improve visualization of tubal anatomy. Proximal tubal catheterization is successful in opening between 70% and 90% of fallopian tubes. In 30% to 40% of patients receiving tubal catheterization, no further expensive, invasive surgical procedures such as laparoscopy or IVF are necessary.

<P>
The two diagnostic procedures currently used for evaluation of tubal patency are hysterosalpingography (HSG) and laparoscopy with chromopertubation. Each option has certain advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. 
<P>
 A hysterosalpingogram is an X-ray of the uterus and the fallopian tubes which allows visualization of the inside of the uterus and fallopian tubes. The  X-ray will reveal any abnormalities of the uterus as well as tubal problems such as blockage and dilation (hydrosalpinx). The HSG is considered a non-invasive procedure; its performed without anesthesia in an outpatient setting. One of the disadvantages of HSG is the potential for tubal spasm (reflex closure) at the cornua, which leads to the erroneous diagnosis  of tubal blockage. False-positive readings occur in as high as 40% of patients undergoing an HSG.
<P>
Laparoscopy & chromopertubation is a procedure used to evaluate pelvic structures and determine whether or not the fallopian tubes are patent (open). A laparoscope (medical grade telescope) is inserted into the patients abdominal cavity through the belly button.  After assessing the appearance of the pelvis, blue dye is injected via the cervix, through the uterus, and into the fallopian tubes.  Using the laparoscope, the physician observes whether or not there is free spill of the blue dye from each fallopian tube into the abdominal cavity, indicating whether the fallopian tubes are open or blocked.  However, laparoscopy & chromopertubation is an invasive procedure and does not provide the physician with an understanding of what the uterus and fallopian tubes look like inside.

Patients with obstruction diagnosed by <A HREF="hsg.html">hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy</A> in the  proximal  portions of the tube (within 3-5 cm of the uterus) are candidates for <A HREF="selinj.html">selective salpingography</A> with or without <A HREF="diagtube.html">fallopian tube catheterization</A>. Apparent obstruction in this region is often caused by tubal spasm (reflex closure), or cellular debris  and can be diagnosed by catheter techniques.  True obstruction caused by fibrosis and peritubal disease can also be diagnosed using injections of dye via a catheter. 
<P>
Selective salpingography and tubal catheterization have developed into procedural extensions of hysterosalpingraphy that result in improved visualization of the fallopian tube anatomy. Fallopian tube catheterization has proven to be a simple and noninvasive method for determining tubal patency in patients who otherwise would have needed laparoscopy or laparotomy for tubal diagnosis.

A procedure that can be performed either hysteroscopically or fluoroscopically.  The procedure is performed in the first half of the patients menstrual cycle. Access to the uterus and the tubal ostium is gained by  a catheter system (fluoroscopically) or via a uterine catheter placed in the working channel of a rigid hysteroscope. After placing the tip of the uterine catheter in the tubal ostium, a selective injection of contrast (fluoroscopically) or blue dye (hysteroscopically)  is injected directly into the fallopian tube. If proximal obstruction of the fallopian tube is diagnosed, a micro-catheter and guidewire are advanced into the fallopian tube, the guidewire is removed, and contrast agent is injected. This procedure enables more accurate diagnosis by either confirming proximal obstruction or determining that the tube is actually clear, suggesting that the apparent obstruction may have been due to soft cellular debris.

	<P>PLEASE ADVISE WHERE DOES TVX'S INTEREST IN VALERIE GOLD SHOW UP IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT SEPT30/96.IF TVX OWNS SHARES IN VALERIE GOLD, THEN THE COST OF THIS INVESTMENT SHOULD SHOW UP SOMEWHERE ON THE BALANCE SHEET. IF TVX ALSO HAS ACQUIRED A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN THE PROPERTIES OF VALERIE GOLD, THEN SHOULDN'T THESE INTERESTS OR OPTIONS BE NOTED IN THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL???  PLEASE ADVISE HOW TVX INTERESTS ARE DISCLOSED IN TVX'S SEP30/96 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND IF THERE IS NO DISCLOSURE, PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Mineral Hill underground mine lies in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana in the United States, eight kilometres northeast of Gardiner and 90 kilometres south of Livingston. The wooded property, which covers approximately 6,500 hectares, ranges in elevation from 1,900 to 3,000 metres above sea level. In 1995, the mine produced 34,900 ounces of gold at a cash cost of $359 per ounce compared to 39,300 ounces at a cash cost of $321 in 1994.</B>

		</TABLE>
		<P><IMG SRC="/images/MineralHill3.jpg" ALT="Mineral Hill Mine" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=157 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT>Lower grades, a shortfall of tonnage milled and additional development costs in accessing the ore zones on the 1,000 and 1,300-metre levels were responsible for the lower production and higher costs.
<P>TVX Gold has owned a 100% interest in the Mineral Hill mine since October 31, 1993, when it acquired the 50% interest previously held by Homestake Mining Company of California.
<P>Proven and probable ore reserves in the Mineral Hill deposit were estimated at December 31, 1995 to contain 287,000 ounces of gold. When the Mineral Hill deposit began production in September 1989, its reserves contained 350,000 ounces of gold. By the end of 1995, the mine had produced over 253,100 ounces of gold. Exploration of the new Ski Slope zone, discovered in 1995 half a kilometre down dip from the Mineral Hill ore zone, was very successful adding approximately 50,000 ounces of gold to reserves. The Crevice Mountain deposit is also expected to yield more ore when underground exploration and development begin. Additional mineralization in the area represents future exploration potential.
<P>The Mineral Hill orebody is a stratiform deposit which occurs within Archean metasediments, in banded iron formation, biotite schists and in quartz lenses and boudins within the biotite schists. Gold mineralization, associated with sulphides and occurring as free gold, is accompanied primarily by arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and scheelite.
<P>The Crevice Mountain orebody sits within the same group of metagreywacke rocks as Mineral Hill, and consists of numerous sub-parallel quartz lenses. Gold occurs predominantly in free form within the quartz, and is accompanied primarily by arsenopyrite and pyrite.
<P>Access to the Mineral Hill mine is from four adits. Mining is carried out seven days a week using a combination of cut-and-fill and room-and-pillar methods. Most of the waste rock mined to access the ore is used as backflll.
<P>Ore from the mine is treated at the on-site mill which uses the cyanide leach Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation process to recover gold. During 1995, mill capacity was increased from 500 tonnes to 600 tonnes per day by increasing thickening and filtering capacity. A gravity feed circuit will also be incorporated into the process in 1996 which is expected to reduce the requirement for reagent supplies substantially, and hence decrease milling costs.
<P>About 30% of the 4.3-kilometre access tunnel being driven from the Mineral Hill mine to the Crevice Mountain deposit had been completed by the end of 1995, unexpected groundwater having slowed progress. The tunnel which was begun in October 1994, is now expected to reach its target in early 1997. The estimated cost of the Crevice Mountain project is $14 million.
<P>Development of the Ski Slope project began in August 1995. By the end of 1995, the access ramp had been driven 220 metres towards its target length of 1,000 metres. The project will cost an estimated $2 million.
<P>Mineral Hill's total production for 1996 is planned at 40,000 ounces of gold.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The New Britannia mine is TVX Gold's newest gold producer. This operation is located in the Snow Lake mining district of northwestern Manitoba, 700 kilometres north of Winnipeg. The mine was officially opened in November 1995. To the end of the year it had produced 14,500 ounces, and is planned to produce at an annual rate of 100,000 ounces with cash costs averaging $210 per ounce for the life of the mine. Capital costs to bring the mine into production were $38 million.</B>

		</TABLE>
		<P><IMG SRC="/images/NewBritannia2.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=129 BORDER=0 ALT="New Britannia Site">TVX Gold has a 50% interest in and operates the New Britannia mine with High River Gold Mines Ltd. holding the remaining 50% interest. This joint venture is managed by a committee on which each company has equal representation. Its extensive landholdings cover over 10,000 hectares and are contained within a 200-square kilometre defined area of interest for which an extensive exploration program is planned.
<P>New Britannias proven and probable reserves were estimated at the end of 1995 to contain approximately 806,000 ounces of gold, sufficient for eight years of operation at planned production rates. It is expected that exploration will add substantially to reserves. The decision to put the mine into production was based, to a large extent, on the considerable exploration potential in the area. In anticipation of future discoveries, the mine and mill facilities have been designed to allow for expanded capacity at reasonable cost.
<P>When operated previously, between 1949 and 1958, the Nor-Acme mine, as it was then called, produced 620,000 ounces of gold from above the 460-metre level. Mining was halted because of the rising costs of production and the fixed price of gold.
<P>Following positive results from a feasibility study completed in early 1994, TVX Gold announced a production decision in mid-1994. As an initial step, the mine was dewatered to the bottom of the existing 600-metre shaft, and mine rehabilitation started in January 1995. Shaft deepening began in May and reached its final depth of 1,000 metres by the end of the year. Development of a haulage drift on the 920-metre level and a crusher station on the 950-metre level is scheduled to commence early in 1996.
<P>The Snow Lake region forms part of the Proterozoic Flin Flon-Snow Lake greenstone belt. Gold occurs within quartz-carbonate alteration zones within an intercalated sequence of altered felsic and mafic volcanic and pyroclastic rocks. In addition to the Toots, Dick, Ruttan and Hogg zones which make up the New Britannia deposit, the Boundary, No. 3 and Birch zones have been identified to the north and the Bounter zone on an optioned property to the south. These zones are all associated with east-trending, north dipping faults that intersect a major north trending thrust fault to the west.
<P>The initial ore for the New Britannia mill is being supplied from the No. 3 zone. This satellite orebody was developed by a decline ramp to a depth of 100 metres and ore was stockpiled until the mill was ready. Longhole mining, as currently planned, will be completed in early 1996.
<P>In the main New Britannia mine, the Toots zone in the upper part of the mine, will be mined by conventional longhole methods. A ramp is being driven from the 545-metre level between the Dick and Ruttan zones to provide access to these orebodies which will be mined by longhole retreat methods, without backflll. Tracked haulage systems will be installed on the 390 and 920-metre levels.
<P>The 1,850 tonnes per day milling complex which incorporates conventional crushing, grinding and carbon-in-pulp technology was completed in October 1995 and poured its first gold in November. Recoveries are expected to average 87%.
<P>Approximately $1.5 million will be spent on exploration at New Britannia in 1996, of which half will be directed towards underground targets along strike and down dip of the major ore zones. The remainder will be spent investigating targets on the New Britannia landholdings and on optioned ground in close proximity to the existing infrastructure.
<P>Production for 1996 is planned for 100,000 ounces of gold.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>During 1995, the Musselwhite project in northern Ontario was the subject of a feasibility study, underwent further exploration and was linked to provincial highway 808 by the construction of a 45-kilometre all-weather access road. This resulted in a decision in February 1996 to construct a new gold mine, at an estimated capital cost of $190 million, with production scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 1997. The mine will produce approximately 200,000 ounces of gold per year for 11 years, at an average cash cost of $200 per ounce.</B>

		<P><IMG SRC="/images/Musselwhite3.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 BORDER=0 ALT="Musselwhite Site">TVX Gold has a 32% interest in the project with Placer Dome Canada Limited, which operates the joint venture, owning the remaining 68% interest.
<P>The 9,100-hectare Musselwhite property is located at Opapimiskan Lake, 120 kilometres north of the town of Pickle Lake and 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay.
<P>Proven and probable reserves at Musselwhite are currently estimated to be 10.2 million tonnes averaging 6.9 grams of gold per tonne and containing 2.3 million ounces of gold. There is significant exploration potential to prolong mining beyond the currently planned 11 year mine life.
<P>Musselwhite's gold deposits occur within the Weagamow-North Caribou greenstone belt of the Superior geologic province of the Canadian Shield. Stratabound gold mineralization occurs primarily within a tightly folded iron formation in a volcanic sequence. The main deposits form a series of sub-vertical tabular bodies along the tightly-folded, northwesterly plunging, T-Antiform structure. Numerous exploration targets on the property include the down plunge of the T-Antiform structure and the south iron formation.
<P>The final feasibility study envisages a two stage mining plan for Musselwhite. In the first stage, a decline ramp will be developed to access the ore in the upper levels of the mine with trucks hauling ore to the mill. In later years, a shaft will provide access to the deeper levels and ore will be hoisted to surface. In addition, lower grade ore from a small open pit will be developed early to create an ore stockpile.
<P>The proposed mill will have an estimated capacity of 3,300 tonnes per day and employ conventional gravity separation, cyanide leach and carbon-in-pulp processes. Gold recoveries of 95% are anticipated. Environmental impact and reclamation plans have already been approved by the provincial and federal governments. When it starts operations, the new mine which will be a fly-in, fly-out operation will provide approximately 280 new jobs.
<P>TVX Gold's share of the $15 million 1995 program amounted to $4.8 million.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Casa Berardi mine is located in northwestern Quebec, 100 kilometres north of the town of La Sarre. The mine produced 61,200 ounces of gold in 1995 compared to 100,100 ounces in 1994 primarily as the result of increased emphasis on the development of new mining stopes. Cash costs increased to $449 per ounce in 1995, because of the reduced production, the higher development costs and emphasis on backfill.</B>
				</TD>
			</TR>
		</TABLE>
		<P><IMG SRC="/images/CasaBerardi1.jpg" ALT="Casa Berardi Mine" ALIGN=right WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=476 BORDER=0>TVX Gold has a 60% interest in Casa Berardi and is the operator. The remaining 40% interest is held by Golden Knight Resources Inc. The property covers approximately 15,000 hectares over a 35 kilometre stretch of land along the Casa Berardi fault. Mining occurs on a 5 kilometre strike length encompassing the Est and Ouest mines and the Principale orebody which is located between the two mines.
<P>Proven and probable reserves at Casa Berardi at the end of 1995 contained approximately 1.3 million ounces of gold. A major underground drilling program is expected to upgrade and increase reserves, especially in the Principale Zone which is currently estimated to contain over 600,000 ounces in geological resources. This deep exploration program will continue throughout 1996 and 1997.
<P>Located within the Abitibi greenstone belt of the Canadian Precambrian Shield, the Casa Berardi gold deposits lie within a 1-2 kilometre thick sequence of intermixed volcanic flows and pyroclastics, coarse to fine classic and chemical sediments, which are bound to the north and south by iron formation. These volcanic and sedimentary rocks appear to thicken and contain a higher proportion of volcanic units to the east, suggesting that an ancient volcanic centre may be located in that direction.
<P>Economic gold mineralization occurs within quartz-carbonate vein complexes and stockworks and in zones of silicification, and sericite-carbonate wallrock alteration. Gold is present as fine free gold in quartz veins or in intimate association with disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite in the zones of silicification and wallrock alteration.
<P>The Est and Ouest mines located about five kilometres apart, are currently being mined at Casa Berardi. Sublevel longitudinal longhole mining with delayed backfill is the main mining method and ore from both mines is treated in a common carbon-in-leach milling facility located at theEst mine. The mill is capable of processing 2,400 tonnes of ore per day.
<P>With the acquisition by the joint venture partners in July 1994 of a full 100% interest in a property containing part of the Principale ore zone, the Casa Berardi joint venture embarked on a major $22 million deep development program. The objective of the program is to allow for more efficient and expeditious mining of the Principale zone as well as providing for exploration at depth and expansion of production. The new 340-metre shaft sunk near the existing Est mine surface plant was commissioned in December 1995 and is currently providing access to the Est mine. The 4.5-kilometre tunnel being developed at the 300-metre level to link the Est and Ouest mines with the Principale orebody is expected to be completed in April 1996. This will allow ore and waste from all operations to be rail hauled underground and hoisted to surface instead of being trucked up each mine's ramp. The complete development program, when finished, will allow Casa Berardis annual production to increase to 800,000 tonnes annually.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Pachicutza project is located in southern Ecuador, approximately 60 kilometres southeast of Loja, near the Peruvian border. The property lies in rain forest at elevations of 1,500-2,000 metres in the Cordillera del Condor mountain range, and is approximately 25 kilometres in length and 12,000 hectares in area. TVX Gold's interest in the project, held through two subsidiaries, effectively gives the company 100% ownership of one block of ground and 92% ownership of the other.</B>
				</TD>
			</TR>
		</TABLE>
		<P><IMG SRC="/images/Pachicutza2.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 BORDER=0 ALT="Pachicutza Site">In 1994 and 1995, TVX Gold completed 23,300 metres of drilling, sampled 8,500 metres of underground drifting and built a sample preparation facility, a fire assay facility and an 18-kilometre road to the property. The work on a high grade zone outlined proven and probable geological reserves of 657,600 tonnes grading 13.6 grams of gold and 79 grams of silver per tonne, 4.3% zinc and 0.7% lead. An additional 300,000 tonnes are contained in the possible category, grading 12.3 grams of gold and 71.5 grams of silver per tonne. Based on these results, an adit is being driven into the deposit to permit development and further exploration. The 1996 program calls for 6,000 metres of drilling, 600 metres of access tunneling and 180 metres of underground drifting along high grade structures. Metallurgical testing has indicated favorable gold recoveries with significant silver and zinc credits.
<P>Pachicutza is projected to produce approximately 58,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually and a by-product zinc-lead concentrate, over a period of six years, with an estimated cash cost below $200 per ounce of gold equivalent. Mine construction is estimated at 18 months with a capital cost of approximately $30 million. In anticipation of development of this mine, TVX Gold acquired the mining equipment, energy generator and processing plant from the mined out Novo Astro mine in Brazil. The plant was dismantled and prepared for shipment to Ecuador in early 1996.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The La Coipa open pit mine in the Atacama desert region of northern Chile is one of South America's largest gold mines and one of the world's largest silver producers. It is located in Copiapo Province, 800 kilometres north of Chile's capital, Santiago, and is accessible by a 140-kilometre road from the regional centre of Copiapo. In 1995, La Coipa produced 282,000 ounces of gold and 9,426,000 ounces of silver, or 409,200 ounces of gold and gold equivalent at a cash cost of $168 per gold equivalent ounce.</B>
				</TD>

		</TABLE>
		<P><IMG SRC="/images/LaCoipa1.jpg" ALT="La Coipa Mine Site" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=165 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0>TVX Gold has a 50% interest in La Coipa, held through its 50% indirect interest in Compania Minera Mantos de Oro which owns the mine. An indirect subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc. of Vancouver owns the remaining 50% interest and is the operator.
<P>Reserves at La Coipa at the end of 1995 contained 6.7 million gold equivalent ounces, sufficient for over 16 years of operation at planned production rates.
<P>The La Coipa property consists of approximately 7,500 hectares of mineral claims. The ore deposits form part of a precious metal epithermal system located in the northern Chilean Tertiary volcanic belt known as the Maricunga belt. The main Ladera-Farellon and Coipa Norte zones are about three kilometres apart. Exploration drilling which resumed in 1992 after an 8-year break has since identified the satellite Farellon Bajo ore zone adjacent to the Ladera-Farellon pit, and the Brecha Norte orebody beside the Coipa Norte deposit.
<P>All of La Coipas reserves occur in oxidized zones. The eastern portion of the Coipa Norte orebody and the Farellon deposit are semi-tabular in form, characterized by high gold grades associated with argillitic alteration and occur primarily within Triassic sediments. The Ladera and western Coipa Norte orebodies are mushroom-like in shape, have high silver-to-gold ratios, are silicified, and occur within a pyroclastic unit, in the upper portions of the mineralized zones. It is believed the Coipa Norte silver zone has not undergone significant erosion, while at Ladera, the upper portion of the host pyroclastic rocks is strongly leached and almost barren, suggesting secondary enrichment as the source of the high silver in the ore.
<P>Mining of all ore and waste at La Coipa utilizes conventional open pit mining methods and equipment. The Ladera-Farellon orebody is being mined in three separate pit phases. Mining of the Coipa Norte deposit began in 1995.
<P>In the milling process, ore is crushed, then ground in a circuit incorporating a semi-autogenous mill with a pebble crusher and two ball mills. The ground ore is leached, then filtered and washed to separate out the tailings, and passed through a Merrill-Crowe plant and the refinery. In operation since 1991, the Phase II La Coipa plant was designed to process 15,000 tonnes of ore daily. During 1995, certain installations from the original Phase I 1,000 tonnes per day agitation leach plant, which was in operation from May 1989 until April 1991, were returned to production to increase overall capacity to exceed 16,000 tonnes per day.
<P>Funding of the Phase II plant was provided by $250 million of project financing arranged on a non-recourse basis to TVX Gold. Based on a $25 million prepayment in December 1995, it is expected that this financing will be repaid before the end of 1996.
<P>Production from La Coipa in 1996 is planned to amount to 237,000 ounces of gold and 13.6 million ounces of silver.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Crix&aacutes mine, one of Brazil's most efficient gold producers, is located in Goias State, approximately 250 kilometres northwest of Goiania, the state capital, and three kilometres from the town of Crix&aacutes. A paved road links Crix&aacutes to the Belem-Brasilia highway 120 kilometres to the southeast. In 1995, the mine produced 126,500 ounces of gold at a cash cost of $177 per ounce, compared to 126,300 ounces at $170 per ounce in 1994.</B>
				</TD>

		</TABLE>
				<P><IMG SRC="/images/Crixas4.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 BORDER=0>TVX Gold has a 50% interest in the Crix&aacutes mine. The remaining interest is held by a Brazilian affiliate of AMSA Limited, a Minorco company.
<P>At the end of 1995, proven and probable reserves in the Mina III and Mina Nova deposits contained 2.7 million ounces of gold sufficient for 17 years of mining at current production rates. Additional reserves are expected to be confirmed by continuing underground exploration in 1996 focused on the new Corpo Sul orebody. This orebody was discovered in 1995 and is adjacent to the Mina III deposit. It is currently estimated to contain geological reserves of 608,000 tonnes averaging 6.8 grams of gold per tonne.
<P>The 20,782 hectare Crix&aacutes property is located in the vast Crix&aacutes greenstone belt. It forms part of a well-preserved tract of Archean terrain which is composed of three belts of volcano-sedimentary rocks trending north-south and intruded by granitic rocks.
<P>The Mina III orebody, which currently provides all feed for the mill, is a stratabound deposit. It occurs within folded metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the Ribeirao das Antas formation. To date, three zones have been identified in the Mina III deposit, along three stratigraphic horizons. They are elongated in a west-northwest direction, stacked vertically above one another, and separated from each other by about 60 metres of barren rock.
<P>The Upper Zone is geologically complex, and contains massive sulphide ore, chloritoid-garnet ore with lesser amounts of arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and magnetite and sericite ore, a quartz-sericite schist with minor disseminated arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. The Intermediate Zone, sandwiched within a dolomite unit, is very similar to the Upper Zone but less continuous than the other zones. The Lower Zone is associated with a very persistent metachert horizon which has been traced by drilling for 1,800 metres down plunge. Gold mineralization occurs within the metachert, at the footwall of the chert and in the footwall and hangingwall of graphite schists.
<P>The Mina Nova satellite orebody is located approximately two kilometres from the Mina III mine. Developed by a decline ramp, it will be brought into production during 1996 and is expected to produce 55,000 tonnes of ore grading 4.2 grams per tonne annually.
<P>The Mina III deposit, which is an underground operation accessed by a decline ramp, has been in production since 1989. Mining is carried out primarily by mechanized cut-and-fill and room and pillar methods concentrated between the 150-metre and 200-metre levels of the mine. Ore is hauled to surface by 22.5 tonne trucks.
<P>The on-site mill uses the Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation process to recover gold. During 1995, several operational improvements, at minimal capital cost, allowed the mill to process 508,000 tonnes of ore compared to 453,000 tonnes in 1994. Approximately $100,000 will be spent in 1996 to increase the mill's annual capacity to 540,000 tonnes.
<P>The Crix&aacutes mine is planned to produce approximately 126,000 ounces of gold in 1996.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Braslia mine is a large tonnage, open pit operation, situated approximately 200 kilometres southeast of Brazil's capital city, beside the town of Paracatu in the state of Minas Gerais. In 1995, the mine produced 162,500 ounces of gold, compared to 168,800 ounces in 1994. Cash costs averaged $235 per ounce in 1995, compared to $196 per ounce in 1994. The increase in cash cost year over year was primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.</B>
				</TD>

		</TABLE>
			<P><IMG SRC="/images/Brasilia2.jpg" ALT="Braslia Picture" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141>TVX Gold increased its equity interest in the Braslia mine by 10% to 33% effective January 25, 1995. The other partners are a Brazilian subsidiary of Rio Tinto-Zinc plc (51%) which is the operator and a subsidiary of Montana Power Corporation (16%). The mine property, which has been in commercial production since 1988, covers 57,000 hectares.
<P>Proven and probable reserves at Braslia contained 3.4 million ounces of gold at the end of 1995. This is sufficient to maintain production at planned rates for a further 14 years.
<P>The Braslia gold deposit occurs within the Paracatu sandstone-shale formation, a unit of Proterozoic age in the central Brazilian Shield. Native gold, alloyed with minor amounts of silver, tends to occur around quartz boudins, especially where these are marked by layers of iron carbonates and pyrrhotite. These boudins, sometimes up to 0.5 metres long, occur within a weathered, well laminated, dark grey, 40 metre-thick phyllite layer which contains thin lenses of carbonate, lenses or single crystals of sulphides, a thin but persistent bank of quartzite and other thinner and less consistent sandstone horizons. Mineralization also continues for approximately 30 metres below the main phyllite, in a partially weathered phyllite with visible sulphide and a high graphitic content. Grades in this lower layer, which is not included in the current mining plan, are similar to the remainder of the orebody.
<P>The ore at Braslia is sufficiently soft that it requires no drilling or stripping and only minimal blasting. Bulldozers loosen and heap the ore for front-end loaders to lift into dump trucks which deliver it to the mill. In the plant, the ore is crushed and ground and introduced into a flotation circuit. After the coarse gold is recovered by gravimetric methods, the remainder is recovered by cyanidation and carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp processes. An ore stockpile is built up during the dry season to provide millfeed in the wet season when pit mining is slowed by heavy rains.
<P>Ongoing improvements to the mill have allowed throughput to exceed 13.4 million tonnes annually over the last two years. A further expansion of capacity to 18 million tonnes annually is also planned, at a capital cost of approximately $65 million. This will include construction of a $45 million hydrometallurgical plant starting in mid-1996. The goal of the expansion is to increase annual production to 260,000 ounces of gold in 1998, with production thereafter planned to average 210,000 ounces of gold per year to the year 2005.
<P>The introduction of 85-tonne trucks and ancillary equipment as part of the expansion, at a capital cost of approximately $14 million, is expected to improve production efficiencies early in 1996. The new equipment replaces the previous 20-tonne mining fleet operated by a contractor.
<P>Production from Braslia in 1996 is planned at approximately 158,000 ounces of gold.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Kasperske Hory property in the Czech Republic is located near the town of the same name in an area where gold mining has been carried out historically. The property is 160 kilometres southwest of Prague and about 20 kilometres from the border of Germany.

		</TABLE>
		<P><IMG SRC="/images/KasperskeHory1.jpg" ALT="Kasperske Hory Site" ALIGN=right WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=183 BORDER=0>When TVX Gold acquired its interest in the property in 1994, the proven and probable reserves were estimated to be one million tonnes grading 6.0 grams of gold per tonne. During 1995, the Company conducted an aggressive $3 million exploration program. This included 1,750 metres of underground development on the 700-metre level of the Golden Creek deposit, 13,000 metres of underground drilling and 6,900 metres of surface drilling. By year end, the reserve and resource base in two separate zones was estimated to be 3,332,000 tonnes grading 9.4 grams of gold per tonne. The larger Golden Creek deposit is estimated to contain 911,500 ounces of gold and the smaller Zdanov zone 96,500 ounces. Both mineralized structures are open along strike and at depth, while previous drilling confirmed the presence of significant gold mineralization over a 1.5 kilometre strike length west of the deposits.
<P>The shear zone hosted gold mineralization is associated with quartz veins and lenses and with mineralized gneiss and migmatite. Very fine to microscopic gold occurs primarily in its native form as well as in gold-bismuth complexes.
<P>During the first half of 1996, the Company plans to carry out a further 300 metres of underground development and 7,000 metres of underground diamond drilling to confirm and extend the mineralization within the Golden Creek deposit in anticipation of a pre-feasibility study in the second half of the year.

				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Kassandra Mines complex is located on the east coast of the Chalkidiki Peninsula in northeastern Greece, approximatety 100 kilometres east of Thessaloniki, the country's second largest city. The property covers 31,400 hectares and includes three mines, base metal milling facilities and a ship-loading facility on the Aegean Sea.</B>

		<P><IMG SRC="/images/Kassandra5.jpg" ALT="Kassandra Mine" ALIGN=right WIDTH=283 HEIGHT=218 BORDER=0>TVX Gold was named the successful bidder for Kassandra Mines in March 1995, pursuant to an international auction. Discussions to advance the completion of the transaction continued throughout the remainder of the year, and engineering, procurement and environmental work were initiated in anticipation of the closing which occured on December 21, 1995.
<P>The Company purchased the Kassandra Mines assets for approximately $46 million, with $19 million paid on closing, and five equal installments of approximately $5.5 million, plus interest, payable on the anniversary dates of the closing.
<P>TVX Gold made its bid for Kassandra Mines after its studies showed that the current silver-lead-zinc operation could be rehabilitated to include an efficient and economic gold operation. Although the deposits have been mined for over 30 years, the gold content of the ore had not been exploited because of its refractory nature. By incorporating pressure oxidation technology into the ore processing phase, TVX Gold expects to achieve gold recoveries in excess of 90%.
<P>The cost of construction of a gold plant and modernization of the existing operation is currently estimated to be approximately $285 million, to be spent over the initial two years of the project. A portion of this amount will be allocated to the enhancement and modernization of the existing mining and milling operations, and will include environmental rehabilitation. The balance relates to the construction of the gold plant, which is expected to start up within two years from receipt of all relevant licences and permits. Full capacity is estimated to be in excess of 300,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually during the initial years of operation, tapering thereafter to approximately 200,000 ounces annually. Significant grants have been made available for the Kassandra Mines project by the Greek government. The Greek government approved, subject to Parliamentary ratification, grants to the project of 35% of eligible capital expenditures. Under the original grant application this constitutes approximately $69 million. The purchase contract provides assurances from the Greek government to TVX Gold of its cooperation to ensure timely issuance of all the necessary licences and project approvals and the early approval and implementation of grants to the maximum degree possible.
<P><IMG SRC="/images/Kassandra3.jpg" ALT="Kassandra Mine" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=167 BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>The Kassandra orebodies are massive sulphide stratabound replacement deposits, and occur within marble layers interbedded with gneiss and amphibolite in the Kerdyllia formation of the Serbo-Macedonian massif, a series of Paleozoic and older rocks. Gold mineralization in the Olympias deposit is associated with arsenopyrite and pyrite. The deposit consists of two zones. The west zone is lensoid in shape, averages 11 metres in thickness, 350 metres along strike and 1,500 metres down dip, and occurs on the west flank of an anticline. The east deposit, 300 metres distant, is arc-shaped, averages nine metres in thickness, 250 metres along strike and 550 metres down dip.
<P>The smaller Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres deposits are skarn deposits, and occur in or at the contact of marble layers with the overlying schists and gneiss. Sulphides are primarily galena, sphalerite and pyrite, and also arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, tennantite-tetrahedrite and a wide range of other metallic minerals.
<P>Indicated reserves at Kassandra Mines are reported to be approximately 17.7 million tonnes grading 5.8 grams of gold per tonne (approximately 3.4 million ounces), 100 grams of silver per tonne (approximately 800,000 ounces of gold equivalent), 3.6% lead and 4.8% zinc.
<P>The Madem Lakkos mine is accessed by a 315-metre shaft and uses the retreat undercut-and-fill mining method. An adit provides access to the Mavres Petres mine, which also uses an undercut-and-fill mining method. Ore from both of these mines is delivered to the Stratoni mill. This 1,200 tonnes per day plant incorporates two flotation circuits and produces lead, zinc and pyrite concentrates, averaging 70% lead and 53% zinc. TVX Gold proposes a number of modifications to improve efficiencies and recoveries at this mill, as well as replacing equipment which is reaching the end of its useful life. It is expected that the Stratoni mill rehabilitation will be completed and recommence operation by the end of the first quarter, 1996.
<P><IMG SRC="/images/Kassandra7.jpg" ALT="Kassandra" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=147 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT>The Olympias mine is accessed by a 300-metre shaft and two declines and uses undercut-and-fill and blasthole retreat stoping methods to mine the ore. For this operation TVX Gold proposes the use of longhole mining with pastefill as the main mining method in the future. Olympias ore is delivered to the Olympias mill, which is similar to the Stratoni plant. Plans are in place to upgrade this mill. The gold plant will treat refractory ore primarily from the Olympias mine. Power for the new plant will be supplied by constructing a 24-kilometre transmission line from the national power grid at Stagira.
<P>Additional potential on the Kassandra property includes the Skouries copper/gold porphyry deposit, estimated to contain 72 million tonnes averaging 0.5% copper and 0.7 grams of gold per tonne.

TVX Gold has the contractual obligation to make additional payments totalling $5.3 million to fund completion of a feasibility study and to obtain final permitting upon completion of which, subject to Russian law, it will have earned a 100% interest in the company.
<P>Preliminary Russian metallurgical work has indicated that a substantial amount of the reserves occur as free gold, and that recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes. The deposit is classic, high grade, epithermal-vein type, associated with the recent volcanism that characterizes the circum-Pacific region.
<P>With some pre-feasibility work already done on the Asacha deposit, TVX Gold anticipates commencing feasibility studies in 1996. Given positive results, the Company envisages an operation producing 100,000 ounces annually.

<P><CENTER><B>CASA BERARDI MINE TO BE PLACED UNDER CARE AND MAINTENANCE</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, January 6, 1997 ... TVX Gold Inc., 60% owner and operator, and its joint venture partner, Golden Knight Resources Inc., announced today that the Casa Berardi Mine in Quebec will suspend its mining and milling operations.  It is anticipated that the suspension will be effective following the three month notice period required by Quebec legislation.  The actual suspension date will be confirmed in discussions with Quebec authorities.

<P>The decision has been taken as a result of continuing operating losses and the need to drill and develop the existing reserves.  During the three month period, TVX on behalf of the Joint Venture, will seek a purchaser for the property which would provide for continuity of operations at Casa Berardi.

<P>The decision to suspend operations at Casa Berardi will result in a charge to fourth quarter earnings of both TVX Gold Inc. and Golden Knight Resources.  The extent of the charge is not yet determined although TVX and Golden Knight have book values respectively of US$55 million and Cdn$58 million.

<P>
<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the TVX Gold Inc conference call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Hick Vice-Chairman of TVX Gold Inc. Please go ahead Mr. Hick.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Thank you operator. Ladies and gentlemen good morning and welcome to the call. With me today in Toronto is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Eike Batista, our new operating management team of David Murray, Cliff Davis and Ken Sangster who I'll say more about in a minute. Rogerio Berto our Senior Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer. Albrecht Schneider our Senior Vice-President of Exploration and Ed Baer our Manager, Investor Relations. The main purpose of the conference call today is to introduce the new senior operation team of TVX. Also to discuss the press release that we distributed last night regarding the update of Kassandra, and then to discuss and take questions on TVX generally. Dealing with the new operating team, just a few words and background about them. David Murray who is now President and Chief Operating Officer of TVX. David brings to TVX over 25 years of mining industry related experience as well as a strong leadership in operations and project management. Prior to joining us at TVX he held the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of RTZ Mineracao in Brazil whose interests include the $230 million dollar Fortaleza Nickel Mine and the Brasilia mine in which TVX has a one third interest. David was responsible for the $400 million dollar development and operation of the Neves Corvo underground copper tin mine in Portugal during his tenure with RTZ, and for that achievement he was named the "Order of the British Empire". Cliff Davis who is Senior Vice-President, North America and as you'll hear later North America in our terms includes Russia. Cliff joined us from Echo Bay Mines where he held the position of Vice-President Projects since 1992. Prior to that he also was involved with the RTZ group, joining them in 1979. In 1985 he took over the operations of Neves Corvo in Portugal as Project Manager where he later held the position of Production Manager and went from there in 1989 to become General Manager of Kennecott Corporation's Greens Creek, a lead-zinc-silver-gold mine in Alaska, and then General Manager of Kennecott's Ridgeway gold mine in South Carolina. Ken Sangster joins us from Otokumpu Oy where he's been since 1990 holding senior executive positions responsible for, among other things, the development of the $600 million dollar Zaldivar mine and processing plant in Chile which is a 50/50 joint venture between Otokumpu Oy and Placer Dome. Prior to that he too spent time with RTZ, joining RTZ Metals Europe in 1975 as Group Technical Director where he was responsible for, among other things, the recommissioning of the Weeljame tin mine in Cornwall. Technical representation on the $400 million dollar Neves Corvo copper-tin mine where he met David and Cliff, and then after as senior consulting metallurgist on a variety of RTZ European projects. Of course that gives Ken tremendous knowledge and experience in dealing with Europe and as Senior Vice-President of European Operations. I'd now like to turn it over to David Murray to take you through a presentation and then at the end, of course, we'll take questions. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you John. I look forward to meeting with some of you over the next few days and few months. The presentation that we have organized today starts with some overall comments from me, some comments of my ideas on operating and project philosophies, and then I will review South American operating investments. Cliff Davis will then talk in terms of North American operations and projects, and as John has said that includes our project in Russia. Albrecht Schneider will specifically talk about the Skouries drill results announced last night. Ken Sangster will then talk in terms of the European projects that we have under development. And Eike Batista will then summarize for you. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The new operating team came in to place effectively in the third quarter of this year. Subsequent to that, between us, we have reviewed and visited all TVX operations and projects and our initial assessment in simple terms is as follows: firstly TVX has strong skills in securing deals; secondly, we believe that the operating structures and procedures need improvement; thirdly, the South American operating investments are solid; fourthly, as a general comment, the North American operating investments are under-developed, however, the North American projects are promising; and lastly, the European projects have a very strong resource base which you will see are certainly strong enough to more than double TVX output over the next five years. The generalized comments that I have in terms of operating and project philosophies are very simple. First of all, our structures need to be defined better than they are today - responsibility, accountability, and authority. We need improved procedures in terms of how we look at new investments of capital expenditure, we need a more rational view in terms of personnel, and we need to improve our purchasing procedures. In my experience, and coming from a relatively developed company like RTZ, I am a very strong believer in operating management with a key executive led by a general manager of the mine. The head office role is to support the general manager with as few staff as possible. In so far as running projects are concerned, again one needs simple structures. It is extremely important that the owner maintains control of the flash heat permanently. However, I also believe that the owner should supervise an EPC or EPCM contractor and I do not believe in TVX running a project organization of its own. Those are very simple directives. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Turning now to our operating investments in South America. The three investments have two common features. First of all they all have reserves in excess of ten years. Secondly, each of the three are managed by reputable companies. Turning to La Coipa, owned 50 percent by Placer Dome and 50 percent by TVX, we shall in the future be faced with declining gold grades. However, this is offset by the fact that La Coipa is now debt free and of course La Coipa has the Chimberos silver deposit which will be of high significance over the next three to four years and which you may well be aware of, we are doing feasibility studies on at the present time. Turning now to Brazil. The Crixas mine is 50 percent owned by Anglo-American and 50 percent by TVX. It has been and will continue to be a reliable and consistent producer. There is expansion potential available and that is under discussion with our partners at the present time. We also have the Brasilia mine, 51 percent owned by RTZ and 33 percent by TVX, again, a reliable consistent producer. It is currently under expansion to 18 million tonnes a year and that is scheduled to come into production by the fourth quarter of 1997 or maybe even a little bit earlier. I am quite satisfied that that expansion will occur on time. The attributable production in 1996, estimated in terms of our share of South American production, is approximately 320,000 to 325,000 ounces at a cash cost around something in the order of $190.00. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a solid operating base. I now turn you to Cliff Davis who will talk about our North American operations and projects.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DAVIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Thank you David. Good morning. I'll start with the operation which is my primary concern at the moment, that's Casa Berardi. Casa Berardi in Quebec is an underground gold operation.  We have made some progress there this year. Operating costs are reducing significantly compared with where they started at the beginning of the year. However, we have continuing problems in terms of production of gold. It's very variable, varies month by month from satisfactory to unsatisfactory largely as a result of inflexibility because of inadequately developed reserves. The future production of Casa Berardi depends very much on the development of the Principale Zone and between the East and the West mines which is where production is coming from at present.  We've been looking at the development of the Principale and it is apparent that we cannot bring that into production for between one to one and a half years from now. This leaves us with a number of alternatives for Casa Berardi and we are looking at all of those alternatives, we're discussing them with our partners.  The key alternatives under consideration at the moment are to continue the operation at a reduced throughput mining only the remnant ore reserves of the East and the West mine. The second alternative is to continue doing that and at the same time develop in the next year to year and a half the Principale Zone and then bring production up based on those reserves. A third alternative being considered is to close the operation down and thoroughly explore the total land package which is a very large land package. And our last alternative is to sell the operation. We are considering all those alternatives. We are discussing them with our partner and we expect to have a decision by the end of this year. Our next operation is the New Britannia underground mine in Snow Lake Manitoba. Considerable progress has been made there this year. We expect to produce 70,000 ounces in 1996 at a cash cost of $310.00 an ounce. For 1997 we're increasing throughput to obtain 85,000 ounces at a cash cost of $275.00 an ounce.  Production is steadily improving. Costs are steadily decreasing. And the cost next year will be achieved in spite of the fact that we are going to continue a very high rate of development and a very high rate of underground diamond drilling, both definition drilling and exploration drilling with the aim of increasing the developed reserves until we get to the point where we have at least one year of developed reserves ahead of us. Musselwhite, a project in Ontario which is operated by Placer Dome, is scheduled for an April start up.  Musselwhite is approximately one month to six weeks ahead of schedule at present. It is on budget currently and is estimated to be about five million US under a budget of $170 million total. The TVX share of that is $54 million. Annualized production is 200,000 ounces a year with TVX share of 64,000 ounces. Next year we're showing a total production of 144,000 ounces commencing in the beginning of April. The estimated '97 cash cost is $230.00 an ounce. In Russia we have a project which is an advanced stage project, the Asacha project in Kamchatka. Asacha is currently in the middle of a feasibility study being carried on by Davy International here in Toronto. It's a high grade underground deposit, 15 grams a tonne. We believe it has a lot of potential. We expect to have the feasibility study done by the middle of next year. At the same time we should have Russian mine permits in place and we should be in a position to make a product decision at that time. The current activity there is completion of a surface diamond drilling program to firm up reserves and add additional reserves and obviously the feasibility study which I mentioned at the start. And that is a quick summary of North American activities. And on to Albrecht Schneider Exploration Vice-President.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		At Skouries, which has been one of the main attractions of TVX's Kassandra assets, the company has started a comprehensive drilling program in August which will lead up to December of this year. Skouries is a classic copper-gold porphyry about ten kilometres inland from the Aegean. Company objectives for this year was to drill about 15,000 metres to a maximum depth of 1,000 metres to assess previous information which is composed of 16,000 metres of drilling and 600 metres of underground development by Nippon mining in 1962, Placer  Development in 1967, and Kassandra Mines in 1975. The objectives were also to revise ore reserve estimations made by Billiton circa 1980s. Billiton concluded that Skouries has an initial reserve of 72 million tonnes at .45 percent copper and .7 grams per tonne gold. TVX objectives were further to explore deeper into the deposit to establish the size of the gold and copper grade information, establish total resource estimates for gold and copper mining conditions and to initiate metallurgical test work for copper and gold. The current status of the project is as follows. Twelve holes were drilled in the central part of the area. Nine holes were drilled in the southern extension. We will have all 22 holes completed by December 15th. At present we have 4,098 metres analyzed which are the seven holes and the two partial holes given to you with the press release. The preliminary metallurgical test work is completed.  We can summarize so far we already had a classic porphyry copper. The volume of known potential ore mineralization extends vertically to 750m. At surface 300 by 250 metres. The opening widens over 500, 400 metres. The full extent of deep level mineralization for both laterally and horizontally are still unknown. The ore is two kinds of ore consisting basically of chalcopyrite-burnite gold with high levels of magnitite. There's also the presence of a shallow copper oxide zone at surface. High copper and gold grades than previously reported were achieved due to the change in drilling methodology and our analytical quality. We have highly consistent gold rates and copper rates over very large intervals. The mean copper rate gold data is 0.64 percent copper and for gold 1.17 grams per tonne gold.  Average grades at .25 percent copper and .25 grams of gold give a grade of .75 percent of copper and 1.36 grams of gold, which we reduce the current data base by 15 percent. The high grade ore near surface averages .8 percent copper and 1.5 grams of gold and the project shows a high grade gold zone at depth which is averaging around 1.1 percent copper and 2.2 grams of gold. Furthermore, we can conclude so far that there's large volume at grades of approximately .6 percent copper and 1 gram of gold with potential credits between 1 and 2.5 grams silver and .15 grams palladium.  Initial metallurgical results show a good copper concentrate of 30 percent with very good recovery in the order of 92 percent. Gold grade in the concentrate ranges from 1.5 to 3 ounces and it's recovery is 88 percent. In general there are very low impurities associated with this concentrate. I thank you very much.  Now Mr. Ken Sangster will continue to speak about our European projects.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good morning. I'd like to cover the areas in two parts. First of all Kassandra in Greece and then the Czech republic. First of all some highlights from the general situation with regards to Kassandra.  Activities during the year were divided into two main parts. Firstly, to put systems in place commensurate with developing large scale projects and secondly a continuation of our drilling program to further define the ore in situ.  In 1996, drilling done in the Stratoni Madem Lakkos Mavres Petres areas totalled some 15,000 metres and in Olympias 5,000 metres and I make special note of that because underground drilling has continued all year in Olympias and at Skouries, which Albrecht has just mentioned, some 15,000 metres. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I would also like to highlight the issue that there is now a strong central government in place in Athens. There is generally a very positive attitude to investment. If I can now move down and subdivide the Greek operations. Kassandra mines, the Stratoni operations which involve the Stratoni mill and the Madem Lakkos/Mavres Petres mines. During the year the Stratoni mill was refurbished and is now operating at a rate of 250,000 tonnes per annum treating mainly Madem Lakkos ore at grades of around 10 percent zinc, 8 percent lead and 200 grams per tonne silver. These operations at Madem Lakkos/Mavres Petres, we believe, have about four to six years life on current mining reserves. But there are possible expansions including areas of high gold at the Madem Lakkos mines. As I mentioned earlier the Olympias infilled drilling continues to confirm ore resources and grade. We have also been working lately on some process enhancement. We believe the use of heavy media separation can remove up to 40 percent of the concentrate weight at zero gold loss. We're also looking at a biox and partial roast as a pre-treatment to autoclave which allows for a smaller autoclave and a smaller gold plant. And work should carry on in generally improving the environment which will include re-treatment of both the concentrate stock piles and of the original tailings. We're proceeding to work on a bankable document which will be ready by the end of 1997. A word or two about Skouries. Albrecht has already covered that in the geological sense. We believe the drilling will confirm a substantial resource. Processing seems to be relatively simple. The test work done to date yields clean copper  concentrate of about 30 percent copper and plus 50 grams per tonne of gold content. Over the next year engineering will be done to determine firstly mining methods, underground and open pit, and also scale of operations. We anticipate having a pre-feasibility study on Skouries completed by the end of 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If I can move on to the Czech Republic, I will summarize the work done there this year. The drilling continues to confirm good grades of plus or minus 10 grams per tonne.  A good deal of process test work has been evolving over the year and we're now in a position to confirm the economic extraction can be accomplished without the mine site use of cyanide. This revised flow sheet should greatly assist permit application. In summary, what does all this mean. European drill indicated resource potential we believe is roughly the following.  At Kasperske Hory around about 3 million ounces.  At Olympias 5 and a half million ounces. Madem Lakkos/Mavres Petres 500,000 ounces. At Skouries 10 million ounces. All in all giving a total of European drill indicated resource potential of 19 million ounces. I'd like to pass on to our Chairman, Eike Batista.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Ladies and gentlemen good morning.  Let me try to summarize TVX's performance during '96.  I have six points. The first, in the beginning of the year I told most of you that my main objective was to find a senior Chief Operating Officer. We actually hired a team of three. I acknowledged the need to improve our technical team. We needed a projects and operational group capable of developing and operating properties to international standards. Finding this team was as difficult as finding a new mine. Their past performance and technical credibility speak for itself. I am convinced that TVX is finally in strong technical hands. Second, at the beginning of the year I also said that Kassandra would develop into a big gold camp, a new gold mining district in the world. The numbers are actually surpassing my own rosy glasses estimates. As you just heard, the reserves and resources will support a big, extremely low cash cost production in the near future transforming Kassandra into TVX's 100 percent owned flag ship, and supporting our goal of surpassing the one million ounce per year production by the turn of the century. Third, please do not forget that Kassandra is Europe, yes Europe. Not Kinshasa, Bangladesh or Jakarta. After landing in Frankfurt you take a two hour flight to Thessaloniki which is Greece's second largest city. An hour later, by car, you're at the mine site. Kassandra is already a running operation with in excess of 600 miners that are being retrained.  It will be producing an estimate of $25 million dollars in revenues for TVX in '97. The deal making negotiations team of TVX has handed the property to the operations team. From now on it is on standard procedural operational mode. Like any mine located anywhere in the world in a very, very civilized place. Greece, as you heard before, has a strong central government for the next four years that fully supports the project. I want to remind you that in the early days when I started with the company Chile had problems of perception, Brazil, the whole of the South American continent. It's time for people to understand that Kassandra is part of Europe and I'm convinced that the visit that we are scheduling for the property, actually scheduled for the 12th of January, will only confirm what I'm just saying. Fourth, something to think about.  How much is our 19 million ounces in resources in Europe worth, given that they are backed up by more than 140,000 metres of drilling and are extremely high grade. Low cost in production is assumable. If approximately $850 million dollars US was paid for Arequipa in Peru. Fifth, gold price. Well to hedge, TVX's hedge is really the fact that all of the new production is going to be extremely low cash cost. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So TVX will have growth and TVX will have low cost. Six and last. Although we concentrated most of our efforts this year in developing existing assets which are big we haven't lost our deal making capabilities. We are as dynamic and alert as always and as you know we only bought and will buy value. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Ladies and gentlemen we'll now open up for questions and I believe you all know how this works and the operator will field the questions so, the first question please.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. We will poll for questions today using our quick cue polling feature. If you have a question please press star and one on your touchtone telephone. If you're using a speaker phone you may need to lift your handset first and then press star one. Should you wish to cancel your question please press star followed by the number sign but please do not hang up. We will poll for questions in the order of request. Please press star and one at this time if you have a question. The first question comes from Mark DeFranco from Pomboy Capital. Please go ahead sir.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi Eike the results look pretty robust to say the least. A question for you, if I try to put some numbers around Skouries, if based on your drill results you've got .75 percent copper 1.36 grams gold, if I use rock value of roughly $32.00 gross. Plugging that into a net smelter model given what Albrecht had said of how the concentrate looked and so forth you should net out of that $32.00 per tonne about $20.00 a tonne. If I subtract out a mining cost of call it $10.00 a tonne, pre-tax to you should be a margin of $10.00 per tonne. Now based on your potential there you're talking north of 200 million tonnes I would take it. I mean this right alone is worth more than your market cap.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. Absolutely. You're correct.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Are the numbers per tonne roughly feasible?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE> 		Ten dollars per tonne cost?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Net to you, right.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE> 		Ken please.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. Ten dollars, yes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		So why are you still trading at $7.00 a share?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		I think actually we haven't really talked to the market since the beginning of the year and as I said before, I mean TVX concentrated in getting a technical team into the company and we're working hard. We drilled more than 50,000 metres in Europe and that's what, as I said before, it's substantiated this resource base with high grade and we're announcing it now. And I wanted, actually, the new technical team to revise our operations because I had doubts about our past technical team. So we needed to do that homework. Now we're ready and we're informing it to you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		The numbers look great. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. Our next question comes from Dalton Ferris from Carriage House Investors. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes, hello. I guess my comment is I'm just a private investor and what I continually see in the press is sort of some sort of negative news about TVX and you guys scurrying around sending out faxes trying to patch it up. So, I think that's what's causing the share value to be what it is. I think somehow you've got to get ahead of that.				</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			It's John Hick. Perhaps a comment on that. Particularly when you're dealing in foreign countries, and I'm thinking for example Greece and the Czech Republic where a lot of that negative publicity has come out, unfortunately we cannot control the local press. We spend a lot of time, effort and money dealing with public relations and informing the local people both at the government levels right down to the man at the street. But you're dealing with, in some cases, people that don't understand mining and unfortunately it's no different there than it is here. The bad news gets the press, the big negative stories about cyanide and pollution get the press and people don't want to hear too much about reality. We're working to change that. I think Greece is a good example of that. If you look at the general press reporting in Greece today I think you see some very good reporting. People now understand what we're doing. There's still going to be negative press. There's always going to be negative press. You can't please everybody. But I understand your concern. It's a concern that we're continually addressing as best we can. But we're confident we can do it right. We know we can. We say that. We're always prepared to talk to people about that but it takes time for them to understand.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Alvaro Cattao from AGX. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CATTAO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. My question is with the grade that you gave us on the press release, what are the approximate cash costs in dollars per ounce of gold considering the gold or the gold equivalent with copper?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This is David Murray here. I think you need to start off from the basis that Albrecht has already told us that the initial resource estimates will be available towards the end of January. I think it's extremely difficult for me to give you an answer to that question without a resource estimate and without conceptual engineering. And I really believe that your guess is as good as mine. But I must say I'm pretty positive about it.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CATTAO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Don McLean from Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good morning gentlemen. A couple of questions. Albrecht you went through on the Skouries, the copper recovery I missed. You said 88 percent on the gold.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Ninety-two percent Don. Ninety-two on the copper.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. And you had clean cons.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Any sense of what a strip ratio might be so we can start putting together our own estimates?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		I'll hand over this to Ken.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Between two and three.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		That was on the Skouries deposit. Thank you. Cliff on Casa Berardi you went through basically a full spectrum of different possibilities. Can you give us a sense as to the possibility of closure, what probability might you attach at this early stage of this evaluation to that possibility?	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DAVIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>			I wouldn't like to put a finger on it Don. It is one of the three or four alternatives we are strongly considering. The final decision is going to be made by the end of the year. Obviously in conjunction with our partners. And I wouldn't like to say anything more than that.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Then maybe I can ask the question a little bit differently. You were saying that the operating costs have dropped but you're still  having some, I guess, continuity problems in terms of the variability of production. Do you see that within the next year and a half that's going to be something that's just going to carry on and what kind of an operating cost would that translate through to in that timeframe?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DAVIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Yeah. That's the problem we've got. We have inflexibility of operation because we don't have enough developed stopes in the remnants of the East and West mine. That won't change until we've got some additional reserves developed. The best opportunity is probably the Principale Zone. That's a year and a half away so we're going to be left with the situation we've got now for at least a year and a half if we continue operations. Operating costs are currently in the mid to high $300.00 an ounce and we don't see that changing in the short term.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you. That helps, Cliff.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question is from Chris Bradbrook from Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRADBROOK:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yeah, good morning. Could you maybe give us some idea of what sort of production rate you anticipate at Skouries, and also the timing of potential production at both Skouries and Kassandra.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. This is David Murray again. I will repeat my caution that was given to you before. We need to complete the overall initial resource estimate in January. We need to do conceptual engineering in terms of mining methods. We need to do engineering in terms of scale and I really believe that it's far better that you look at the overall resource and then make your own conclusions. Our conclusions are obviously going to be positive but I would rather wait until we do some proper engineering on it. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRADBROOK:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. But no estimates on the timing?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		The timing, your guess is as good as mine. What we are looking for is a pre-feasibility during the course of next year. That will be followed by feasibility documents acceptable to banks and then construction. The construction period in terms of a plant operation like this is relatively simple.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRADBROOK:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Mark Burridge from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BURRIDGE:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good day gentlemen. Pleasure to meet your new team. I've got a question and I apologize if this has already been asked or answered because I wasn't on the call, and that is you talked a lot about your operations development. How about your exploration projects internationally? The one that springs to mind right now is Gurupi and I was wondering if you could give an overview of that and your exploration strategy over the next few years.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Albrecht.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>	In Brazil at present we are running two major ventures. One is Gurupi as you just said together with Sante Fe our partner. Santa Fe is presently preparing pre-feasibility information which by April next year will put us in the position to review our strategy for the future on how we will proceed at Gurupi. Gurupi is a large low grade deposit within the Amazon region. We have a second project together with Battle Mountain called Volta Grande do Xingu on the Xingu River. It has currently the resource potential in the order of two million ounces and we are preparing for next year's drilling program to define this area further. This area is just one in a very large sector.  Apart from Brazil, we are currently very active in Ecuador in a joint venture with Newmont and Cogema in a very interesting epi-thermal low grade oxide gold deposit and we are also active in Nicaragua in a joint venture with our partner, Triton. In Nicaragua we are exploring a gold structure which was previously operated successfully by Noranda. We are very positive about the current results in Nicaragua. So basically our exploration strategy in this year and the future will be concentrating on our joint ventures and also evaluating constantly upcoming possibilities. We have also an exploration interest in our lease in Greece.  We also concentrate in Russia in additional areas around our current mine claims. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BURRIDGE:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. John Bridges from Flemings. Please go ahead sir.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi Eike. Congratulations on the progress. I just wondered perhaps one question on Skouries, the latest drill results, how do they compare with the work done by Billiton, better/worse...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		The drill results done by Placer Dome and Nippon Mining were conducted in the early 60s in a period where gold was sitting around $50.00, the copper price was sitting around 35 cents.  The gold levels were established a different way. Another major difference is that the drilling was vertical and the deposit geography shows vertical structures so the drilling was basically down deep. We have changed this. We're drilling now two structures. This gives much better average information about deposits and both sectors are resulting in higher grades of gold and copper.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Great. You talk about a higher low grade zone and a deeper high grade zone. What's the cut-off? How deep do you have to go before you get into the better grade stuff?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		At Skouries the central part is mineralized throughout so there's no real low grade zone. The higher grade zone at surface indicates the possibility of a very effective open pit scenario where you have grades averaging 1.5 grams of gold and about 0.8 percent copper. This in the area of about 300 metres to about 500 metres. Here grades can go up in gold over 200 metres with 2.7 grams and 1.44 percent copper.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Great. And now perhaps La Coipa, the Chimberos silver rich project. Would that simply be replacement of other reserves or would you be perhaps increasing the scale of the operation down there?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		David Murray here. Those alternatives, in fact, are under discussion with Placer and I would assume that we will come to a conclusion on how to economically exploit it during the course of the next year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Paul Carmel from Bunting Warburg. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	
<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good afternoon. David, you mentioned the possibility of declining grades at La Coipa. Could you give me an idea as to what these grades might be looking like in the next two to three years - gold head grades and silver head grades. A second quick question is on Casa Berardi. I'm just wondering about Principale. It seems to me there's been sort of an optimization program going on up there for a couple of years now. I'm just wondering why we're still sort of a year and a half away from accessing the Principale deposit. Cliff maybe you could touch on that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DAVIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>			It's Cliff Davis. I'll answer that question first. The work that's been done wasn't solely to access Principale. It was a development program as it was called to link the East and the West mine at depth and put a shaft in at the east end of the mine. It was not only to provide bottom access to Principale but also to provide access for exploration throughout the strike length. It didn't, of itself, develop Principale. If you were doing it again, if I were to sit here now and say well would I do the Principale in conjunction with providing that access development I  would state that development itself should have been going on at the same time. The method chosen of development didn't really lend itself to doing that development concurrently so unfortunately we're left here now with while we have access at the bottom we don't have sufficient ore that's developed. That still has to be done.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This is David.  Back to La Coipa. The silver grades that we're looking at in terms of the current mines continue much the same at the moment. The gold grades probably will be dropping in the region of 15 percent or something like that. However, one needs to add on top of that in fact the potential extraction of Chimberos, which is, as I've said before, not yet determined.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Bill Otton from Beutel Goodman. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi. Albrecht, I know it's difficult to do over the phone but I'm just having trouble understanding the geometry and the high grade and lower grade zones of  the Skouries deposit. If I can read off numbers that as I understood initially, I understand that the surface expression of the outcrop is about 300 by 250 metres?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This information has been known by us from the previous owners and previous people who drilled there to a depth extend over 400 to approximately 550 to 600 metres. It has always been known that this is a rather vertical pipe. But in our drilling now we constantly record on the lateral wall rock zones and how they would compare with the pipe and what would really happened there. Drilling in outer zones we saw a continuation of mineralization in the wall rocks which could not really be associated easily with the centre of height. For that reason there is a strong indications now that there is a major source at depth which generated some other large mineralized zones which was later on dissected by secondary inclusion which is this pipe which re-enriched surface part of the deposit and enrich the centre core. We have also depleted core beyond the centre core.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. But just for the drilling that you've done, the area that you've investigated, the pipe area, would it be, is it fair to say that the sort of surface expression of that is about 300 by 250 metres?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		And then it continues down about 300, 400 metres deep?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		It continues to about 350 metres deep and then it opens up to the shape of a flask.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Right. Okay. And the aerial, if you took a slice at say 350 metres, a horizontal slice, that area might be 400 by 500 metres, something like that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This is what we're currently thinking of.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Right. And then the total vertical extent of that flask is at least 750 metres.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yeah. I think 750 metres is again the figure which we are dealing with at the moment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Does anybody there have any idea how deep you could go on an open pit with these kind of grades and this kind of structure, sort of a vertical structure like that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		It's Ken Sangster here. No, not really. As David said we're just embarking on pre-feasibility. We've got no geo-technical information as such. During the course of the pre-feasibility study, that will be one of the things that we need to look at, both in the extraction method and scales. As to the best possible depth for open pit I couldn't really answer that at the moment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thanks very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Barry Allan from Gordon Capital. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ALLEN:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Good afternoon gentlemen. I apologize if I missed it, but could you just sort of flesh out where the construction of the autoclave at Kassandra lies and what the time table is for completion there?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. Ken Sangster here again. The situation is at the moment that we're now doing surface drilling. We've been doing underground drilling all year to try and get about 70 percent of the reserve into proven and probable category. We're also using that program to gather samples and prove our process flow sheet. There has been considerable work done on designing an autoclave and we feel very happy that all of the parameters have been covered. The area we're looking at at the moment actually is trying to do some pre-treatment before the autoclave, trying to get more work done on the concentrator so that we get a more selective number for the autoclave to reduce its size and adjust the oxygen demand, etcetera. All of this, again, will come out during this year when we produce a bankable document.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ALLEN:<BLOCKQUOTE>			And how long would the construction period be potentially after the bankable document?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		We're looking at 24 months at present.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ALLEN:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Okay. And just briefly, Pachicutza, what's the status of that project now?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Pachicutza, we have had a feasibility study done on Pachicutza. It could become a 45,000 ounce producer at a cash cost of $190.00, but in the context of our operations it's probably a property that we will dispose of.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ALLEN:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Alright. Thank you gentlemen.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. At this time I would like to remind everyone if you do have a further question please press star and one on your touchtone telephone at this time. We do have a further question from John Bridges from Flemings. Please go ahead sir.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		In order to get some sort of strip ratio if you could give me some indication as to what sort of slope angle the rocks around the Skouries deposit would take?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		As I say we've really very little new technical information. There's a surface expression there obviously and there's a tunnel that was done by Placer and Nippon. The rock quality looks reasonably high. But slope angle will not be defined until we get engineering work completed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. I just wanted to know sort of order of magnitude. That's all, that's fine. On the concentrate, you were saying it's generally good. Any impurities at all, anything that's going to affect the price a smelter would pay?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		No. On the tests that we've done at the moment it's extremely low levels of impurities. It was very clean. I mean on the metallurgy we've done minerals are not present so you wouldn't expect them in the concentrate.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. You said something about palladium in the ore?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. We reviewed scientific literature on and determined that Skouries has been known to be a platinum minerals carrier and basically there's a very low level but it's an interesting scientific peculiarity in the ore.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Would that be recoverable?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		It would be recoverable but I doubt it will be sufficient to reach payable levels.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. We have a further question from Bill Otton from Beutel Goodman. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi. Just quickly on Kasperske Hory. Can you give us an idea as to the timing for production and the production rate and what sort of processing method you're going to be using if you're not using any cyanide.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. The drill program at Kasperske Hory which is ongoing is concentrating on the western extension. On the samples that we've dealt with so far which are in the central zone, the technology we're looking at is really rather simple. It's a mixture of gravity and flotation. The gold tends to be either relatively free and quite course or relatively fine but lots of sulphide, a combination of both methods gives good recovery in the order of 90 percent and a concentrate around about ten ounces per tonne. And in terms of time scale, if you were to build that sort of operation it's obviously a simple construction program than if you were building a full scale gold extraction plant. You'd be looking at about an 18 month construction period.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		And when would you expect that to be in production?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		We're in the process of starting a pre-feasibility study now. We then have to take that on with all the extra drilling to a full feasibility study. I would think that you're looking at about a two year program in that and then of course you have to get all the permits and approvals. So you're looking at about a two year program to a bankable document situation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. And would you have anything in mind as far as production rate goes given a three million ounce resource right now?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Well it depends very much on the geometry. I mean until we do the drilling and get the geometry of that ore body, the constraint is probably a mining and available space problem. But a rough idea would be half a million tonnes a year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. And where would you be processing the concentrate?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		I'm not sure at the moment and until we get enough test work done to get a firm handle on how that concentrate would behave and sort of variable it it's likely to be in a mixture of probably leeching it could be even smelting in which case you could sell it to a major smelting organization.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Right. Okay, thanks very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. And the next question come from Mr. Robert Rossetti from Dean Witter. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ROSSETTI:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi. Are you, do you have any plans for further write-offs for the Mineral Hill property and are there any write-offs planned for Casa Berardi?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BERTO:<BLOCKQUOTE>			This is Rogerio Berto here. As Cliff said we're still studying the Casa Berardi situation. We will review the final documentation when it is presented by the technical people and assess the best alternative.  With regards to Mineral Hill, it was written off in the third quarter.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ROSSETTI:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from David Mallalieu from Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could tell me what you're looking forward to if the Principale Zone goes ahead for future capital costs on that project and could you give a brief description of what you are actually looking for with regards to potential reserves at La India?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Principale would appear to require in the order of, depending on the method of development of Principale, somewhere in the order of $20 million to $25 million Canadian to develop the reserve for mining.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		And would there be a, would you have in mind a specific production rate associated with that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		We think the Principale Zone can probably provide about 1,000 tonnes a day, about 60 percent of the mill feed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		In La India the current resource potential was set by Russian development agencies. They calculated 2.4 million ounces. Our initial reviews demonstrate there should be at least a possibility to convert more than 50 percent of this number into initial reserves.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		And what is your program now for actually translating that into the mineable category?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		At the moment we are drilling to define this resource and we are planning to increase our drilling rate until the end of April or beginning of May in order to have a full picture of the resource estimates for late 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		That would be considered an underground mine?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This would of course be an underground mine, yes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Don McLean from Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Just a couple more questions. Looking at the Kassandra processing plant what would be your sense of how the operating costs could go compared to what was used in the initial numbers that were given to us Ken? Do you feel that the initial numbers are still numbers we should be working with or should we be thinking of capital operating costs higher or lower? That was one question.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. I think if we are successful and we've already got to the pilot stage on heavy media separation, you're looking at 40 percent of the feed weight being rejected. So this obviously means that your concentrator will be smaller, sort of for the run of mine tonnage and we're also looking at ways of enhancing the grade of gold into the concentrate feed or the residue feed in this case with all the weight being taken out at the feed end to the gold extraction unit. So, yes, you are looking at somewhat lower capital costs and we believe with high grade feed lower operating costs can be achieved.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Right. Okay. One other thing. Ken if you could just re-run through the breakdown of your 19 million ounce European resource again just to make sure I've got the right numbers.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. At Kasperske Hory we have a drill indicated potential of about three million ounces. Olympias is five and a half million ounces. Madem Lakkos Mavres Petres point five or five-hundred thousand, and Skouries at ten million ounces. Now we've done the Skouries drill indicated resource calculation based on current information using copper equivalents but using 65 cents per pound of contained copper. In other words counting the NSR.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		If you broke it into the gold only part of the ten million ounces what would that be Ken?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		About seven and a half million ounces.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Great. The book value for Casa Berardi Rogerio can you give me that too, please?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ROGERIO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		The book value as of September '96 is about $55 million US in our books.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. Thanks gentlemen.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>	Thank you.  The next question comes from Paul Carmel from Bunting Warburg.  Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>PAUL:<BLOCKQUOTE>		I read somewhere that there's a state archeological institute in Greece that has to sign off on any development decision on Kassandra? Is there any truth to that and if there is does it concern you and how does it sort of play in with your program there?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Paul it's John Hick. First of all in Greece the study of antiquities is extremely important and the Ministry of Culture is in charge of looking at antiquities in Greece. Every time you do something in Greece they are involved. They are involved in the following way. If antiquities are known to be in an area then they get involved in the project. If antiquities are discovered then they are entitled to be notified and to look at it. They then examine the antiquities and the level of examination depends on the facts and then they make a determination one of two ways. They either decide that although there may be antiquities relative to whatever that particular project might be it's not, if you will, important enough to override the project. If they feel that the antiquities are important enough then they can be involved and you may have to make alterations in your project to allow for those antiquities to be looked at from an archeology extent. That's the law of Greece. It's there. It's always been there and we will comply with it. On the Kassandra claims, if you will, or concessions, back in the '70's I guess, when they looked at putting an autoclave in before, this was by the Greeks, they had the Ministry look at the claims and they made a determination at that time that there was nothing of significant importance from an archeological point of view. So that's the current situation. They will look at things and if things are found then we'll deal with that on a case by case basis. But no, it's not something that is of great concern to us. It's the normal procedures.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>			I guess maybe worst case scenario your plant gets delayed. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			No. I don't see that it delays anything, Paul, because there is an existing plant there. There's an existing mine and an existing mill. The way the law works, they're not going to come in and say we think we've now got to take that back because we now decide something is there. The issue that it relates to is where do you place the new gold plants. And we have a study going on right now looking at at least, I believe, half a dozen locations for the gold plants. One of the factors that you will look at is whether there is any possibility of the archeological issues taking place. So I don't think it will delay anything. It's just part of the study for the appropriate plants.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Olympias is an underground operation.  Now Skouries is going to be a big pit. What's been done on that in terms of sort of condemnation work?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Well again, very little has been done but the whole Kassandra area has been deemed not to be of significance and we're not aware of any, if you will, historical work that shows any possibility there. But the same thing applies. But we don't see it as an area of concern.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Okay.  Thanks John.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. At this time we only have time for one more question. And we have a further question from Dalton Ferris from Carriage House Investors. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		What do you expect your gold and gold equivalent production to be in ounces in 1997?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Our projection for 1997 production will be in the range of 400,000 ounces.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Is that a lot lower than it was several months ago? Is it a rolling forecast?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		We estimated for 1996 420,000 ounces and we're going to be in the range of 400,000 in 1997 so there's no big change. The total production is basically the same.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. And at this time I would like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. John Hick. Please go ahead sir.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Thank you. With the end of the questions we'll now close off. We thank you all for participating. We look forward to seeing some of you in person in Toronto this afternoon and New York tomorrow afternoon. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><CENTER><B>KASSANDRA MINES UPDATE</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, December 2, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to provide an update on the current status of its drilling campaigns being conducted by its wholly-owned Greek subsidiary, TVX Hellas, at its three existing mines at the Kassandra mines project in Greece and, to announce the initial results of the exploration program at the Skouries copper-gold porphyry deposit, which is part of the Kassandra mines concessions.  

<P>At the Madem Lakkos mine, which is currently being mined and provides mill feed to the Stratoni mill, a total of 12,102 metres of drilling has been completed to date with assays averaging 8.2% Pb, 13% Zn and 120 g/t Ag.  At the Mavres Petres mine, also located near the Stratoni mill, 3,146 metres of drilling have been completed with results to date averaging 7.4% Pb, 9.5% Zn, 213 g/t Ag and 5.1 g/t Au.

<P>At the Olympias mine, all work is continuing normally including ore definition drilling being conducted both underground and from surface.  The main purpose of this drilling is to provide a complete understanding of the nature of the existing Olympias orebody to assist in preparing the optimal future mine plan.  This information is the basis for the finalization of the design of the process recovery flowsheet to recover lead, zinc, silver and gold from the Olympias ore.  At Olympias, 166 drill holes totaling 3,235 metres of infill drilling at the main western orebody have been completed.  The assay results to date are confirming average grades of 5.5% Pb, 7.7% Zn and 10.4 g/t Au.  At the eastern part of the Olympias orebody, approximately 952 metres of drilling has been completed, however, only one assay result is available to date which showed similar base metal and gold values.

<P>TVX Hellas commenced drilling of the Skouries deposit in August 1996.  It is located within the southwestern portion of the Kassandra Mines claims, approximately 10 kilometres from the Aegean coast, in a sparsely populated area.  The exploration program was designed to reassess previous information regarding the deposit and to get a better understanding of the full extent of the mineralization.  Detailed exploration work was conducted in the 1960's by Nippon Mining and Placer Development Ltd. and in the mid-1970's by the previous Kassandra mines owners.  The information resulting from this previous work formed part of the Kassandra assets.  This work included 16,000 metres of drilling and 600 metres of drifting and was concentrated on the central part of the deposit.  Initial assessment demonstrated that the deposit extended to a depth of approximately 400 metres.  However, a few deeper holes showed interesting potential at greater depth.  

<P>The current drilling program extends to greater depth than previously explored, going to 1,000 metres in depth, as well as testing lateral extensions.  

<P>TVX Hellas expects to complete approximately 22 drill holes, totaling 15,000 metres of drilling by mid-December 1996.  As of December 1, approximately 90% of the drilling has been completed, while assay results are currently available on the first seven drill holes and parts of the subsequent two.  

<P>Initial Skouries results are contained in the attached table.

<P>The average grade of all assays is 0.64% Cu and 1.17 g/t Au.  Excluding approximately 15% of the samples by cutting at < 0.25% Cu and 0.25 g/t Au, the grades increased to 0.75% Cu and 1.36 g/t Au.

<P>Results to date reconfirm Skouries as a classic pipe shaped copper-gold porphyry.  Drilling shows exceptionally continuous ore grade mineralization over 800 metres in central parts of the pipe; while laterally to the pipe mineralization in schist wallrocks increases from surface to depth from 80,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> to 200,000 m<SUP>2</SUP>.

<P>It appears that the deposit consists of two higher grade zones: a near surface zone of approximately 0.8% Cu and 1.5 g/t Au and a high grade core zone at depth of approximately 1.1% Cu and 2.2 g/t Au.

<P>Complete assay results and an initial resource estimate for Skouries are expected to be available by the end of January, 1997.

<P>To date, a total of approximately 35,000 metres of drilling has been conducted on the Kassandra Mines concessions.  The results to date are confirming the previous ore reserve information provided by the Greek government and the high quality of the orebodies.

<P><CENTER><B>TVX ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, November 8, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. reported today that it incurred a net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996 of US$23.3 million (US$0.14 per share), compared to net earnings US$1.3 million (US$0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 1995.  Net loss for the nine month period was US$13.2 million (US$0.08 per share) compared to net earnings of US$9.8 million (US$0.06 per share) in the corresponding 1995 period. During the quarter, the Company, as part of its ongoing review of its global operations, decided to suspend the mining and milling operations at Mineral Hill and place the mine under care and maintenance.  As a result, the Company took a US$29 million one-time charge to earnings.  This charge was partially offset by gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which were primarily responsible for the other income of US$7.7 million.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1996 was 108,000 ounces (78,800 ounces of gold and 2,224,000 ounces of silver) compared to 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1995.  Year to date production was 320,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 311,100 gold equivalent ounces in 1995.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales during the third quarter of 1996 of 92,900 ounces was US$407 per ounce compared to US$383 per ounce on 107,900 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1995.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the third quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to US$239 from US$218, principally due to the reduction of mill throughput attributed to the hardness of ore encountered at La Coipa, the Company's principal mine and the high cost of production realized at the Mineral Hill mine, which was partially offset by the removal of the contract miners at Brasilia and diminished use of contractors at the Casa Berardi mine.

<P>AGREEMENT WITH TVX GOLD INC. FINALIZED</B>
</CENTER>

For Immediate Release


<P>October 31, 1996 ... The Board of Valerie Gold Resources Ltd. and TVX Gold Inc. are pleased to announce the signing of formal agreements whereby TVX has been engaged to manage the exploration and development of Valerie's 85% owned Mamatla property in Mexico.  TVX is assuming the management of the property, effective immediately.  The first year's exploration programme on the Mamatla property will include airborne geophysics, ground geophysics, soil geochemistry, geological mapping and a minimum of 20,000 metres of drilling at an estimated cost of US$4.9 million with a reserve for additional definition drilling of a further US$2.0 million.   The intent of the above-mentioned programme is to investigate, in a systematic fashion, the major structures of the property.

<P>The Mamatla Mineral Reserve Project is located in Mexico, crossing the borders of Mexico and Guerrero states, consisting of approximately 20,800 hectares.

<P>Work to date has identified silver, gold, zinc, and lead mineralization over a length of 4 kilometres from El Capire to Cruz Blanca.  Geological mapping and sampling confirms a possible extension of this mineralization for several kilometres to the northwest.  At El Capire, results to date represent a near surface mineralized zone some 30 metres thick along the line of the 800m long cross section of El Capire to Aurora I.  One diamond drill hole at Yerba Buena at the south-east end of the extensive five kilometre San Carlos breccia zone indicates a possible second mineralized system.  In addition, current exploration work has gone beyond the principal target areas, concentrating on greenfield targets, to determine the presence of anomalies outside the main zone.

<P>As part of the arrangements, TVX has been granted a right of first refusal with respect to the Mamatla property.

<P>Toronto, Ontario, October 29, 1996 ... In response to erroneous press articles regarding TVX Gold Inc.'s Kassandra Project in Greece carried in the October 29 editions of the Financial Times of London and The Financial Post of Toronto, TVX is making the following statement to clarify the current situation.  

<P>TVX announced on October 22, 1996 that the blockade that had been preventing full access to the Olympias mine at its wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas', Kassandra project in Greece had been lifted.  Certain of the communities and residents in the area of the Olympias mine had been blocking full access to the Olympias operations because of their concerns about mining in the area.  As a result of negotiations between senior Greek Government representatives and representatives of the said communities, the blockade was lifted.  TVX Hellas immediately commenced moving materials and equipment into the site to allow the planned redevelopment and reopening of the mine and mill and to complete the planning for the construction of a gold recovery plant.  Since that time, no "further delays" have been experienced.  On the contrary, TVX Hellas has enjoyed full access to the Olympias mine and mill facility and the mobilization of equipment and material has been expedited.  

<P>The Kassandra Mines property, which encompasses approximately 314 square kilometres, was studied by the responsible archeological authorities having jurisdiction at the time that the former owners were considering building a gold plant in the late 1980's and a formal determination was made at that time by the Ministry of Culture stating that the Kassandra site was not of archeological significance.  There has been no "discovery of an ancient city" and no official statements of the Archeological Department of the Ministry of Culture have been made to this effect.

<P>After discussions with the local archeological authority, TVX Hellas allowed a general surface survey of the property to be made by representatives of the 16th Archeological Department of Greece.  "The archeological service neither sought nor obtained a court order".  The proposed site of the gold extraction plant has not yet been determined and will not be determined until after the appropriate studies and permit applications are completed.  It would, therefore, be impossible to say that anything of archeological significance was "discovered on the proposed site".

<P>There is significant archeological interest in the Chalkidiki region, most specifically the site known locally as "Ancient Stagira", which is believed to be the site of the birth place of the philosopher Aristotle.  The site, where extensive archeological work continues, is not located within the Kassandra mining property and is not affected in any way by the mining that has been carried on in the Stratoni and Olympias areas for in excess of 20 years.  The "Ancient Stagira" site is located on the Aegean Sea, south of the village of Olympiada, north of the town of Stratoni, approximately eight kilometres by road from the Olympias mine.  The refurbishment of the existing Olympias mine and mill and the development of a gold plant will be done in accordance with the applicable Greek laws which govern all appropriate criteria, including engineering, construction, environmental and others.  If any antiquities are found in the course of any such work, there are specific legal procedures in place in Greece which would pertain.  Furthermore, the refurbishment and development of the existing Kassandra mine assets can hardly be described as a "greenfield project".  

<P>TVX Hellas and TVX Gold have enjoyed the assistance and support of the Government of Greece in resolving the situation at Kassandra and continue to work with the relevant Government ministries.  As part of its discussion with the concerned communities, the Government did not "announce an independent inquiry into the TVX concession area".  What was agreed was that an independent mining research firm would be involved in evaluating the potential site locations for the gold plant and would make recommendations.  This would be the normal procedure that TVX would undertake in any event.    

<P>TVX regrets that these erroneous articles, which have caused confusion in the marketplace, have detracted from the excellent progress currently being made in Greece.

<P><CENTER><B>MINERAL HILL MINE PLACED UNDER CARE AND MAINTENANCE</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, September 3, 1996 ...TVX Gold Inc. today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Mineral Hill Inc., will suspend its mining and milling operations at the Mineral Hill mine in Montana effective immediately.  TVX Gold stated that the continued losses and capital expenditures necessary to continue the current operations at Mineral Hill are not justifiable.  TVX Mineral Hill will, however, continue the surface drilling program at Crevice Mountain to enable the company to properly assess this resource which may justify mining on this project in the future.  For these reasons, the mine, mill and associated facilities are being put on a care and maintenance basis for the time being.

<P>The decision to suspend operations at Mineral Hill will result in a charge to third quarter earnings of TVX Gold Inc. of approximately US$29 million ($0.18 a share), including provision for future site reclamation.

<P>Production at the mine has decreased as a result of mining lower grade ore and an ongoing shortfall in mill feed from the main Mineral Hill mine.  As a result, cash operating costs at the mine have risen to US$535 on a year to date basis.  Year to date production amounted to approximately 17,200 ounces of gold. Contributing to these problems have been the delays encountered in the Crevice tunnel drive, principally due to unexpected water inflows.

<P>The majority of the current workforce of 138 employees will be laid off.  TVX Mineral Hill is working with the employees in respect of the lay off and assisting in outplacement.

<P>Toronto, Ontario, August 19, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. ("TVX") announced today that The Toronto Stock Exchange has accepted TVX's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid for its common shares through the facilities of The Toronto Stock Exchange.  On August 20, 1996, TVX may commence making purchases of up to a maximum of 5,000,000 common shares which represents approximately 3.07% of the 162,734,388 issued and outstanding shares of TVX.  Any shares acquired will be purchased at the market price for the shares at the time of acquisition.  The bid will terminate on the earlier of the date determined by TVX and August 19, 1997.

<P>Proceeding with the normal course issuer bid will give TVX the flexibility to purchase its shares if it determines that, as a result of the difference between TVX's view of the fundamental value of the shares and the market price, it is in the best interest of TVX to do so.

<P>Toronto, Ontario, August 8, 1996 ... Net earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 1996 were US$3,879,000 (US$0.02 per share), compared to US$2,900,000 (US$0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 1995.  Net earnings for the six month period were US$10,174,000 (US$0.06 per share) compared to US$8,490,000 (US$0.05 per share) for the first six months of 1995.  During the second quarter, the Company had gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which was primarily responsible for the other income of US$2,400,000 realized in the period.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1996 was 95,400 ounces (76,600 ounces of gold and 1,401,500 ounces of silver) compared to 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1995.  Year to date production was 212,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 216,800 gold equivalent ounces in 1995.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,200 ounces was US$396 per ounce in the second quarter of 1996 compared to US$383 per ounce on 103,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1995.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to US$231 from US$207.  This increase was due primarily to an ongoing shortfall in tonnage and the milling of lower grade ore at the Mineral Hill mine and a five week shut down of operations at the Casa Berardi mine stemming from a legal strike which was settled on May 27, 1996.

<P><CENTER><B>TVX GOLD INC. ANNOUNCES THAT GREEK PARLIAMENT RATIFIES KASSANDRA MINES CONTRACT AND RELATED PROVISIONS</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, July 31, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to announce that the Greek Government bill to ratify the Kassandra Mines purchase contract, including the related articles providing for  the ratification of  the  35 per cent grants from the Greek State and regulations for the timely issuance of all necessary licenses and permits in connection with the construction and operation of the gold recovery plant for the Kassandra Mines, was  today passed by the Greek Parliament and will become law upon normal publication in the Official Gazette. 

<P>While the main provisions of the purchase contract effecting the legal transfer of the Kassandra Mines assets to TVX Gold Inc.'s  wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., was legally effective without further action upon its signing  on December 21, 1995, the Greek Government chose to ratify the entire contract together with the necessary provisions relating to the grants and the permits which did legally require Parliamentary approval.  The approval of the bill was supported by the three major political parties: the ruling PASOK party; the official opposition party, New Democracy and  the Political Spring party; which collectively represent 97% of  the seats in the Greek Parliament.

<P>Since the signing of the purchase contract in December 1995, TVX Hellas has been concentrating on the comprehensive review and refurbishment of the existing operations including the Olympias and Stratoni mills, the Olympias, Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres mines and the port facility at Stratoni. A comprehensive environmental review is being undertaken and some remedial work is already underway. The  retraining of existing employees is also well advanced. To date, the basic refurbishment and upgrading of the Stratoni mill has been completed with the Madem Lakkos mine currently operating to supply feed to the Stratoni mill. The first shipments of lead/silver and zinc concentrates, respectively, occurred in July. 

<P>The completion of the Parliamentary approval process will facilitate progress at  the Olympias mine and mill complex and work related to the gold recovery plant.

<P>TVX GOLD FURTHER STRENGTHENS ITS SENIOR OPERATING MANAGEMENT TEAM

<P>Toronto, Ontario, May 31, 1996 ... Mr. Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to announce the continued strengthening of its Senior Operating Management Team with the appointment of Mr. Kenneth J. Sangster as Senior Vice President, European Operations. The appointment of Mr. Sangster, in conjunction with the recent appointments of Mr. David Murray as President and Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Clifford J. Davis as Senior Vice President, North American Operations, provides the Corporation with strong and experienced senior operations management to lead its expanding operations and project development teams.

<P>Kenneth Sangster, as Senior Vice President, European Operations, joins TVX from Outokumpu Oy where, since 1990, he has held the senior executive position responsible for the development of the $600 million Zaidivar mine and processing plant in Chile, a 50/50 joint venture between Outokumpu Oy and Placer Dome. Beginning in 1965, Mr. Sangster worked for Anglo American in Zambia in various capacities before moving to Consolidated Gold Fields in Australia in 1969 as a Metallurgical Superintendent. In 1975, Mr. Sangster joined RTZ Metals Europe as Group Technical Director where he was responsible for, among other things, the recommissioning of the Wheal Jane tin mine, technical representation on the $400 million Neves Corvo copper/tin mine development in Portugal and acted as senior consulting metallurgist on a variety of RTZ European projects. Mr. Sangster is currently the President of the U.K. Mineral Industry Research Organization, a member of the Eurometeaux Research Panel and a Board Member of the Mining Association of the U.K.

<P>The appointment of Mr. Sangster, who is expected to assume his new position in August, and the recent appointments of Messrs. Murray and Davis provide TVX with three new senior members of its Operating team (having over 90 combined years of mining industry-related experience) and will strengthen TVX Gold's management as the Corporation continues the successful development of its global assets.

<P>BMEC can acquire a 50% equity interest in the property in consideration of exploration expenditures totalling US$3.5 million until June 1, 1998 and property payments of US$890,000 over the same period.

<P>The property, which comprises approximately 15,100 hectares, is located in the Amazon basin of Brazil approximately 460 kilometres southwest of the city of Belem, on the Xingu river. Gold occurrences in the area have been studied and developed by various mining companies from the 1950's up to today.

<P>The Volta Grande project is located in the famous Carajas Mineral province, belonging to the Palmeiras Greenstone belt. The shear belt is eight kilometres wide and extends through the property for over 18 kilometres. The joint venture area shows strong intrusive dioritic and tonalitic magmatic activity, associated with intense tectonic hydrothermal phenomena and primary gold occurrences which have been the target of garimpeiro activity.

<P>Preliminary exploration initiated by TVX outlined three major targets. These were defined by soil geochemical, auger, channel sampling and initial drilling and showed the following results:

   <OL>   
   <P><LI>A trend in the diorite domain (shear zone) has an extension of 2,500 metres by 1 00 metres wide, with gold values greater than 0.5 g/t in saprolite material which was confirmed by the first 1,000 metres of auger drill sampling. Channel sampling in saprolite gave the following gold values: 1 00 metres/0. 53 g/t; 22 metres/1.23 g/t; 24 metres/1.47 g/t; 19 metres/0.78 g/t. Internal shear veins in the same trend indicate high gold grades suitable for underground mining; varying locally in thickness of 1.0 to 3.0 metres with gold values of 12.0 g/t to three to four ounces per tonne.

   <P><LI>A greenstone sequence with a soil-geochemical gold and copper anomaly of three kilometres and hosted in metabasalt. Another anomaly of one kilometre length shows more than 100 ppb of gold with channel samples over a 20.0 metres thick sequence averaging 1.28 g/t.
   <P><LI>A tonalite sequence with multiple shear-related quartz veins. The first three exploratory holes, intercepted 0.65 metres with 13.45 g/t gold; 1.14 metres with 7.99 g/t gold and 2.5 metres with 1.46 g/t gold.
   </OL>

<P>As part of the 1996 exploration program, the joint venture will continue with auger drilling on the open-pit targets (saprolite) and with a diamond drilling program of 3,800 metres to define the open pit and underground targets.

<P>TVX ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

<P>Toronto, Ontario, May 16, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announces that net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 1996 were US$6,295,000 (US$0.04 per share), representing an increase from US$5,590,000 (US$ 0.03 per share) in the first quarter of 1995. During the first quarter of 1996, the Company realized significant gains on the disposition of minority equity investments, the most significant of which was the Gold Reserve shares acquired through the Brisas property settlement.

<P>Gold equivalent production was 117,300 ounces (101,500 ounces of gold and 1,131,500 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1996 compared to 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 91,400 ounces increased to US$390 per ounce in the first quarter of 1996 compared to US$ 375 per ounce on 101,400 gold equivalent ounces sold in the first quarter of 1995. A significant portion of the difference between ounces produced and ounces sold relates to an increase in inventories at La Coipa.

<P>Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis in the first quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to US$230 from US$225 principally due to increased costs at Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill which were partially offset by improvements at La Coipa.

<P>TVX GOLD STRENGTHENS ITS SENIOR OPERATING MANAGEMENT TEAM

<P>Toronto, Ontario, May 15, 1996 ... Mr. Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to announce the strengthening of its Senior Operating Management Team with the appointments of Mr. David Murray as President and Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Clifford J. Davis as Senior Vice President, North American Operations. The Company also anticipates the announcement of a third member of this Senior Operating Management Team as Senior Vice President, European Operations, to be made by month end and whose qualifications and mining industry-related experience are in keeping with those hereby announced.

<P>David Murray, as President and Chief Operating Officer, brings to TVX Gold Inc. over twenty-five years of mining industry-related experience as well as strong leadership in operations and project management. Prior to joining TVX Gold, Mr. Murray held the position of President and CEO of RTZ Mineracao, the wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary of Rio Tinto Zinc ("RTZ"), whereby he established a long-term relationship with the Corporation through the TVX/RTZ joint venture Paracatu (Braslia) mine. He joined the RTZ Group in Zimbabwe in 1970 and has held senior executive positions in England, Wales, Germany, Spain and Portugal. In Portugal, he was responsible for the $400 million development and operation of the Neves Corvo underground copper/tin mine, an achievement for which he was named to the Order of the British Empire. In 1993, he moved to Brazil as President and CEO, RTZ Mineracao, which interests included the $230 million Fortaleza nickel mine and the $65 million expansion of the Braslia mine in which TVX has a 33% interest.

<P>Clifford Davis, as Senior Vice President, North American Operations, joins TVX Gold from Echo Bay Mines where he held the position of Vice President, Projects since 1992. Mr. Davis joined the RTZ Group in 1979 as General Manager of two underground tin mines in Cornwall, England. In 1985, he moved to Neves Corvo, Portugal as Project Manager and, later, held the position of Production Manager at this large underground copper/tin mine. In 1989, he became General Manager of Kennecott Corporation's Green's Creek lead/zinc/silver/gold mine in Alaska, and later, General Manager of Kennecott's Ridgeway gold mine in South Carolina. In 1992, he returned to Alaska as Vice President, Projects for Echo Bay Mines.

<P>Mr. Batista is also pleased to announce that Mr. John Hick will now serve in the capacity of Vice Chairman of the Corporation. The promotion of Mr. Hick and the appointments of the three new senior members of its Operating team (with over 90 years of mining industry-related experience) will strengthen TVX Gold's management as the Corporation continues the successful development of its global assets.

<P>Toronto, Ontario, April 22, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that based on a vote conducted by Casa Berardi Syndicate des Metallos d'Amerique Union members late Friday evening a decision was made to turn down the Company's latest offer, and a legal strike commenced. TVX Gold has been in discussions with Union representatives since December in anticipation of the contract expiration date of March 7, 1996. The parties have been working with a mutually agreed conciliator since mid-March. The Company has suggested a further meeting with Union representatives as soon as the conciliator is available. The Casa Berardi mine is currently not operating and is under the care and maintenance of senior staff. TVX Gold has a 60% interest in Casa Berardi and is the operator. The remaining 40% interest is held by Golden Knight Resources Inc.

<P>TVX GOLD INC. ANNOUNCES 1995 RESULTS

<P>Toronto, Ontario, March 29, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that earnings for the year ended December 31, 1995 were US$9,414,000 or US$0.06 per share, which is a decrease from US$22,779,000 or US$0.14 per share earned in 1994. The principal reason for the year over year decrease was lower translation and foreign exchange gains, increased operating costs at Casa Berardi and Braslia and higher exploration spending. For the fourth quarter of 1995, losses were US$425,000 compared with earnings of US$3,598,000 or US$0.02 per share in the corresponding 1994 period, primarily as a result of a US$2.1 million write-down of marketable securities. These marketable securities were, however, disposed of subsequent to year end resulting in the Company recovering its original investment.

<P>Gold and gold equivalent production was 423,100 ounces in 1995 compared to 436,900 ounces in 1994. In the fourth quarter of 1995, gold and gold equivalent production was 112,000 ounces, compared with 105,700 ounces in the fourth quarter of 1994. Average realized revenue on a per gold equivalent ounce sold basis was US$380 in 1995 compared to US$372 in 1994.

<P>In 1995, average cash cost per ounce on a per gold equivalent ounce sold basis was US$219 compared to US$199 in 1994. The increase was primarily due to higher costs and lower production at Casa Berardi and the impact of the appreciation of the Brazilian currency, increasing local costs at our Brazilian mines.

<P>TVX GOLD ANNOUNCES THE RESUMPTION OF BASE METAL PRODUCTION AT THE STRATONI MILL AT ITS KASSANDRA MINES COMPLEX

<P>Toronto, Ontario, March 27, 1996 ... TVX Gold is pleased to announce the resumption of base metal operations at the Stratoni mill.

<P>TVX Gold's wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., purchased the Kassandra Mines assets on December 21, 1995. At that time, all activities were suspended to effect a comprehensive refurbishment of the operations including the Olympias and Stratoni mills and the Olympias, Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres mines and to enable employees to be retrained.

<P>TVX Hellas completed the basic refurbishment of its Stratoni mill over the last ten weeks including upgrading the facility, modernizing and enhancing existing flotation cells, updating certain machinery and replacing reagent lines. During this period, employees have been receiving training in modern mining and milling methods, including alternate ground control, and safety techniques and practices consistent with TVX Gold's corporate standards.

<P>The Stratoni mill plans to produce a lead-zinc concentrate at a rate of 700 tpd with mill feed from the nearby Madem Lakkos underground mine where mining has recommenced. Initial mill recoveries are approaching approximately 90% with the potential for further improvements based on tests conducted at the Lakefield Research test facility.

<P>In keeping with Greek tradition, the Bishop of Chalkidiki christened the facility on its reopening.

<P>TVX ANNOUNCES BRASLIA MINE EXPANSION

<P>Toronto, Ontario, March 20, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today a US$65 million expansion plan at its 33% owned Braslia mine, Brazil's second largest gold producer. The board of directors of the joint venture company operating the mine approved plans to expand the current operation over a two year period with the goal of increasing annual production to 260,000 ounces of gold by 1998.

<P>A feasibility study completed in 1995 indicated the viability of increasing production capacity from the current 13.8 mty to 18 mty. The ore to be processed as part of the expansion will continue to include CTB1 ore and a hydrometallurgical plant, the construction of which will commence in June 1996 at a total capital cost of approximately US$45 million, will be used to expand gold output at the mine.

<P>As part of the expansion program, eight 85 tonne trucks are currently being utilized to increase efficiencies. Previously, Braslia employed a fleet of 20 tonne trucks operated by contractors. Capital expenditures of US$14.1 million were spent to purchase new equipment including three CAT D10-N 530hp bulldozers, three CAT 992-D front end loaders and the eight CAT 777-C 85 tonne trucks.

<P>UPDATE ON STATUS OF KASSANDRA MINES PROJECT

<P>Toronto, Ontario, March 11, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that, in connection with its recently acquired Kassandra Mines operations in Greece, it is encouraged by the recent reaffirmation of support by the Greek Government to the successful development and operation of these assets. Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of the Company, stated that "TVX continues to be very excited about the potential of this project and is committed to the successful establishment of a significant gold producing operation; the Company looks forward to working in conjunction with and with the support of the Greek Government to achieve this objective".

<P>TVX President John Hick and other Company officials had an extremely positive meeting last Thursday with Greek Development Minister Mrs. Vasso Papandreou and her Deputy Minister Mr. Ioannidis in which concerns relating to delays caused by local protesters at the Olympias mine site and the most appropriate means by which to obtain all requisite development and operating permits and licences were discussed and addressed and the Government's strong support of the project was reaffirmed. After this meeting, representatives of the Ministry reported that "both the Government and the Ministry are resolved to go ahead with the project" and that, with respect to preventing further delays at the Olympias mine site, "measures will be taken against illegal acts and local residents will be briefed, in cooperation with TVX Hellas, that the project is environmentally sound." Local resistance to the reopening of the Olympias mining operations is apparently based on environmental concerns and the potential effect on local tourism. Both TVX and the Government anticipate that this opposition will be eliminated when residents are made more aware of modern environmentally sound operating practices, the positive environmental contribution of the proposed pressure oxidation gold recovery plant and the importance TVX places on environmental issues and its sound environmental operating record internationally.

<P>TVX Hellas continues to enjoy local support in the Stratoni region in connection with the reopening of mining activities in that area and mine rehabilitation and initial environmental work is proceeding.

<P>In the meeting with the Ministers, a joint task force comprised of representatives of the Ministry and TVX Hellas was established to facilitate and expedite both overcoming the local concerns and the implementation of the mine rehabilitation program and gold plant construction.

<P>The Kassandra Mines assets are located on the eastern coastal region on the Chalkidiki Peninsula in northeastern Greece, approximately 110 kilometers east of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. They encompass mining concessions over a total area of 314 square kilometers and include the Olympias and Stratoni deposits, including three existing producing mines, base metal milling facilities capable of in excess of 3,000 Tpd and a ship loading facility on the Aegean Sea. The Olympias and Stratoni deposits have been mined for the last 30 years, producing lead/silver and zinc concentrates. Indicated current reserves at Kassandra are approximately 14 million tonnes grading 6.3 grams per tonne of gold (approximately 2.8 million ounces), 100 grams per
tonne silver (approximately 500,000 ounces of gold equivalent ), 3.6% lead and 4.8% zinc.
There is also an existing stockpile of arsenopyrite/pyrite in excess of 200,000 tonnes grading
22.65grams per tonne of gold (approximately 145,000 ounces). The gold content of the ore was
not previously exploited due to its refractory nature.

<P>TVX GOLD BOARD APPROVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PACHICUTZA MINE IN ECUADOR

<P>Toronto, Ontario, January 15, 1996 ... TVX announced today that it has completed a successful exploration program encompassing 21,400 metres of drilling and the sampling of 8,100 metres of drifts on its high grade zone of the Pachicutza project in Ecuador, with the following results:
<PRE>
GEOLOGICAL RESERVES

                      Dry metric      Au     Ag       Au   Au Equiv   Zn     Pb
                     tonnes (dmt)   (g/t)  (g/t)  ounces     ounces   (%)    (%)
Proven and Probable      657,600    13.6   79.0	 287,400             4.3    0.7
Possible Reserves        300,000    12.3   71.5  118,700             4.7   0.44
Total                    957,600    13.2  76.60	 406,000    436,800  4.4    0.6
</PRE>

<P>Based on these results, the Board of Directors of TVX approved the next phase of the project which is the construction of a development adit to intersect the mineral structure at the bottom level of the outline reserves. In accordance with the feasibility study already prepared by TVX personnel, these reserves will allow an annual throughput of 180,000 tonnes and will produce at an estimated annual rate of 58,500 ounces of gold equivalent (55,400 ounces of gold; 234,000 ounces of silver) and a Zn - Pb concentrate which will be treated as a by-product. Cash costs are anticipated to be below US$200 per ounce of gold equivalent.

<P>The capital cost before production start-up is expected to be approximately US$30 million and the period of construction is targeted to be 18 months. The life expectancy of the mine, based on known reserves, is approximately six years.

<P>The recently acquired Novo Astro plant, mining equipment and plant power generator, which will be refurbished in Ecuador, has been dismantled and will be prepared for shipment for use on the project.

<P>An underground mine will be developed using the cut and fill method and a plant of 500 tonnes per day will be erected. The mill process to be employed involves crushing, milling, gravimetric concentration and a flotation circuit with a gold recovery rate estimated at 94%.

<P>The mineralization occurs as veins and breccias placed in an intrusive volcanic complex of Cretaceous age, which intrude a granite of probably Paleozoic age. These rocks have been faulted heavily which allowed the development of important vein and breccia systems. The veins, with a general strike of N20'W and deeping 750E to 600W, are located in an area of 1,500 x 600 metres. Their horizontal development has been known by the work of informal miners and their extent in depth has been established by an intensive drilling campaign to an average depth of 300 metres. They have an average width of 0.70 metres. The mineralization consists of pyrite and sphaterite with minor quantities of galena, chalcopyrite and a gangue of rodocrocite. The gold is associated principally with pyrite/sphalerite and may be found as free gold.

<P>Exploration work done to date indicates reserves are open laterally and at depth and the Company remains confident that further exploration work could delineate additional reserves.

<P>TVX GOLD ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFUL RESULTS AT ITS WHOLLY OWNED KASPERSKE HORY PROPERTY IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC

<P>Toronto, Ontario, January 12, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. stated today that its previously announced 1995 exploration program at its wholly owned Kasperske Hory property in the Czech Republic, has been successful in increasing its proven, probable and possible reserves to 3,360,000 tonnes, at a grade of 9.27grams/tonne or approximately 1 million ounces. These reserves are included in the Golden Creek block, over a strike length of 1000 metres up to a depth of 350 metres. Approximately 15,000 metres of diamond drilling and 1.5 kilometres of drifting were conducted within this area. Reserves were estimated on 25 to 50 metre sections. Based on this successful exploration program, TVX anticipates commencing a pre-feasibility study in 1996 while continuing exploration work.

<P>The Kasperske Hory project is located 160 kilometres southwest of Prague near the town of Kasperske Hory, in the Czech Republic, about 20 kilometres from the border of Germany and situated in the Sumava Mountain Range. The orebody is within an environmental buffer zone adjacent to the northern boundary of the Sumava National Park. Mining on the property has taken place since ancient times.

<P>The areas that host the gold mineralization on the property are underlain mainly by west northwesterly striking paragneisses which exhibit moderate dips to the north and northeast. The gold mineralization is largely confined to quartz veins and lenses with subordinate values present in certain sections of the silicified wall rock. Mineralization width ranges between several decimetres to several metres, and the minimum true width taken into account for reserve estimates was 1.5 metres. Individual gold-quartz zones can be traced up to several hundred metres along strike and the total known strike length of the potentially mineralized structures included within the property boundaries is approximately 20 kilometres. Sparse diamond drilling has had positive results along the entire length of the structure.

<P>In connection with the acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets, and in accordance with the joint decision of the Ministers of National Economy and Industry, Energy and Technology, respectively, TVX will receive grants from the Greek state, amounting to approximately US$69 million based on 35% of the currently estimated eligible capital expenditures. In accordance with Greek law, this decision on the grants must be ratified by the Greek Parliament.

<P>To ensure the timely construction of the new plant to enable recovery of the gold, the Greek Government will also submit to Parliament a draft law regulating the issuance of all necessary licenses and permits in connection with the construction and operation of the gold recovery plant for the Kassandra Mines.

<P>The Kassandra Mines assets are located on the eastern coastal region on the Chalkidiki Peninsula in northeastern Greece, approximately 110 kilometres east of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. They encompass mining concessions over a total area of 314 square kilometres and include the Olympias and Stratoni deposits, including three existing producing mines, base metal milling facilities capable of in excess of 3,000 Tpd and a ship loading facility on the Aegean Sea. The Olympias and Stratoni deposits have been mined for the last 30 years, producing lead/silver and zinc concentrates. Indicated current reserves at Kassandra are approximately 14 million tonnes grading 6.3 grams per tonne of gold (approximately 2.8 million ounces), 1 00 grams per tonne silver (approximately 500,000 ounces of gold equivalent), 3.6% lead, and 4.8% zinc. There is also an existing stockpile of arsenopyrite/pyrite in excess of 200,000 tonnes grading 22.65 grams per tonne of gold (approximately 145,000 ounces). The gold content of the ore was not exploited due to its refractory nature.

<P>Toronto, Ontario, November 15, 1995 ... An action against TVX Gold Inc. was commenced today by Messrs. Hendrik M. Visagie, David Lean and James Stephenson, relating to the acquisition by TVX of the Kassandra Mines assets. TVX believes that the claims made by the plaintiffs are frivolous and unfounded and the Company will aggressively and vigorously defend this matter.

<P>The acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets is being negotiated by TVX pursuant to an international tender of which the Company was named the winning bidder by the liquidators of the assets on behalf of the Greek creditors.

<CENTER><B>NEW BRITANNIA POURS GOLD</B></CENTER>

<P>Snow Lake, Manitoba, November 14, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. and High River Gold Mines Ltd. are pleased to announce the opening of their New Britannia Mine. As part of the opening ceremonies, the Honourable Darren Praznik, Manitoba's Minister of Energy and Mines, officially inaugurated the New Britannia Mine, Manitoba's newest and largest gold mine.

<P>The New Britannia Mine, owned 50% each by the operator, TVX Gold Inc., and its joint venture partner, High River Gold Mines Ltd., operates at 1,800 tonnes per day producing approximately 100,000 ounces of gold per year at an expected cash cost of approximately US$210 per ounce.

<P>Following completion of a positive feasibility study, construction of the New Britannia Mine commenced in June 1994. Capital costs to bring the mine into operation were approximately US$37 million.

<P>Present mineable reserves are 4.2 million tonnes grading 6 grams of gold per tonne. These reserves are estimated to contain 780,000 ounces of gold. The considerable exploration potential of the property at depth and the large land package that the joint venture controls offer considerable potential for future additions to reserves.

<P>The development of the New Britannia Mine has been instrumental in the revitalization of the town of Snow Lake. During the construction phase, the mine employed in excess of 300 employees and contractors, over 85% being residents of the Province of Manitoba. The mine will sustain 180 full-time positions in the local community.

<P>The joint venture partners wish to express their appreciation to the Province of Manitoba for its support and cooperation.

<CENTER><B>TVX ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, November 9, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announces that net earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 1995 were US$1,349,000 (US$0.01 per share), compared to US$13,319,000 (US$0.08 per share) in the third quarter of 1994. Net earnings for the nine month period were US$9,839,000 (US$0.06 per share) compared to US$19,181,000 (US$0.12 per share) in the corresponding 1994 period. In 1994, the higher net earnings for both the first nine months and the third quarter reflect the one time foreign exchange gains which resulted principally from the appreciation of the Brazilian currency, the Real.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1995 was 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) compared to 111,100 ounces (88,900 ounces of gold and 1,604,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1994. Year to date production was 311,100 gold equivalent ounces compared to 331,200 gold equivalent ounces in 1994.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 107,900 ounces was US$383 per ounce in the third quarter of 1995 compared to US$373 per ounce on 96,800 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1994.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the third quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$218 from US$190, principally due to increased operating costs at certain mines and lower production at the North American operations and La Coipa. However, the improved La Coipa mine results reflect both a draw down in inventories and higher realized revenues. The continued appreciation of the Brazilian currency accounted for higher costs during the period at the Company's Brazilian operations.

<P>At Mineral Hill, third quarter production was in line with the comparable 1994 period, while year to date production was lower than 1994 reflecting lower grade as the main orebody reaches the end of its estimated life. The newly identified Ski Slope zone, adjacent to the Mineral Hill orebody, is being developed and will provide continued production until the completion of the Crevice tunnel project. Gold production at Casa Berardi was significantly lower than 1994 levels due to lower than anticipated grade and increased emphasis on development and exploration.  The Company expects that increased production levels in the fourth quarter will result in average cash costs in 1995 of approximately US$215 per ounce.

<CENTER><B>TVX ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, August 10, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announces that net earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 1995 were US$2,900,000 (US$0.02 per share), compared to US$2,547,000 (US$0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 1994. Net earnings for the six month period were US$8,490,000 (US$0.05 per share) compared to US$5,862,000 (US$0.04 per share) for the first six months of 1994.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1995 was 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) compared to 112,200 ounces (86,700 ounces of gold and 1,829,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1994. Year to date production was 216,800 ounces compared to 222,600 ounces in 1994.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,000 ounces was US$383 per ounce in the second quarter of 1995 compared to US$370 per ounce on 118,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1994.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$207 from US$192, principally due to decreased grade and tonnage at certain mines. In particular, Mineral Hill faced decreased mill throughput and lower grades, while at Casa Berardi gold production was below plan principally due to lower than planned plant throughput, head grade and planned recovery.

<P>The Brazilian operations results reflected a stabilization of the Brazilian currency and local costs, while production at both Braslia and Crixs were as planned. Novo Astro benefitted from higher than planned plant throughput as it reached the end of its mine life. La Coipa posted a strong quarter as it benefitted from higher than planned head grades and recoveries.

<P>TVX Gold anticipates that continued improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately US$200 per ounce compared to US$199 per ounce in 1994.

<P>Toronto, Ontario, August 3, 1995 ... TVX GOLD INC. announced today that it has acquired a 50% interest in the Asacha and Rodnikovoe gold/silver deposits located in South Kamchatka, Russia, through the acquisition of 50% of the outstanding shares of Trevozhnoye Zarevo ("TZ"), a Russian company. TZ holds the licences for the development of these deposits. TVX is entitled immediately to a majority representation on the board of TZ and has the contractual right to increase its interest to 100% subject to compliance with Russian law. Under the terms of the agreement with TZ and its existing shareholders, TVX has advanced US$3,390,000 to TZ to be utilized to satisfy existing obligations of TZ. In order to maintain its 50% interest and to increase its interest, subject to compliance with Russian law, to 100% TVX is required to make instalment payments to TZ totalling US $5,260,000 up to completion of a feasibility study and final permitting, which payments substantially represent obligations under the development licences on these deposits. If commercial production is achieved, the current principals of TZ will be entitled to receive from the project payments totalling US$9,000,000 over the first seven years following commencement of commercial production. TVX has the right to relinquish its interest in TZ at any time with no continuing obligation to fund TZ.

<P>The Asacha and Rodnikovoe gold deposits are located in the Southern Kamchatkan gold-silver belt, within 100 and 60 km respectively, of the provincial capital of Petropavlovsk and are accessible by road. The mineralization style is the classic high-grade, bonanza epithermal-vein type, associated with recent volcanism of the circum Pacific region. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work has shown that a substantial amount of the identified reserves are in the nature of free gold and that recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes.

<P>The Kamchatkan regional government released reserve estimates in categories Cl and C2, which are broadly comparable to proven/probable categories under North American standards, for Asacha of 30.37 tons of gold and 58.8 tons of silver at grades of 22 g/t gold and 40 g/t silver and, for Rodnikovoe of 40.39 tons gold at 1 1 g/t and 342.9 tons silver at 98 g/t. Converted to ounces, based on the Russian categories, these deposits would contain 2.28 M/oz gold and 12.9 M/oz silver or a total of 2.45 M/oz of gold equivalent at today's prices.

<P>The licence areas cover 40 sq. km. and contain several additional high grade exploration targets not previously explored and which are believed to have a significant potential to substantially increase high grade ore reserves.

<P>Due to the substantial amount of work done on these properties and the high grade nature of the ore bodies, TVX anticipates that a feasibility study will be done in 1996.

<P>TVX views its interest in Asacha and Rodnikovoe as a first significant step into the former Soviet Union. TVX is currently looking at other opportunities in the Russian Far East, an area of the world which it believes has an excellent potential for significant gold production.

<CENTER><B>TVX ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, May 3, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announces that net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 1995 were US$ 5,590,000 (US$ 0.03 per share), representing an increase from US$ 3,315,000 (US$ 0.02 per share) in the first quarter of 1994.

<P>An important factor contributing to the increase in net earnings was the result of a gain of $7.5 million on the settlement of the Brisas property lawsuit in Venezuela, which was partially offset by higher cash operating costs and increased exploration spending.

<P>Gold equivalent production was 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995 compared to 110,400 ounces (91,800 ounces of gold and 1,341,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1994.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 101,400 ounces was US$ 375 per ounce in the first quarter of 1995 compared to US$ 373 per ounce on 96,200 gold equivalent ounces sold in the first quarter of 1994.

<P>Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis in the first quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$ 225 from US$193 principally due to decreased grade and tonnage. Higher operating costs at La Coipa, lower grades at Mineral Hill, and decreased mill throughput and lower grades at Casa Berardi were contributing factors to the overall increase in cash costs. The Brazilian operations results reflected an increase in local costs due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. However, it is anticipated that improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately $200 per ounce compared to $199 per ounce in 1994.

<CENTER><B>TVX GOLD INC. ANNOUNCES 1994 RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, March 7, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that earnings for the year ended December 31, 1994 were a record US$22,779,000 or US$0.14 per share, which is an increase from US$15,725,000 or US$0.12 per share earned in 1993. For the fourth quarter of 1994, earnings were US$3,598,000 or US$ 0.02 per share compared with earnings of US$4,164,000 or US$ 0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 1993.

<P>Gold and gold equivalent production was 436,500 ounces in 1994 compared to 438,800 ounces in 1993. In the fourth quarter of 1994, gold and gold equivalent production was 105,300 ounces, compared with 110,800 ounces in the fourth quarter of 1993. Average realized revenue on a per gold equivalent ounce basis was comparable at US$371 in 1994 and 1993.

<P>On a per gold equivalent ounce basis, average cash cost per ounce for 1994 was US$199, compared to US$172 in 1993. The increase was generally due to lower ore grades mined at Mineral Hill, Casa Berardi and La Coipa.

<P>Increased exploration and business development spending in 1994 was offset by reduced interest expense, favourable translation and foreign exchange gains and higher interest income earned on cash balances resulting from the issuance of common shares in January 1994.

<P>Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of TVX Gold, said the results are indicative of the ability of the Company's management team to recognize and focus on global opportunities. Mr. Batista also commented that TVX is well positioned for continued growth in the future.

<P><CENTER><B>TVX GOLD INC. RECEIVES OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION THAT IT IS THE
SUCCESSFUL BIDDER FOR THE KASSANDRA MINES ASSETS IN GREECE</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, March 3, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that it has received formal notification from Ethniki Kephaleou S.A. (the "Liquidator") of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, that it is the successful bidder for the purchase and development of these assets.

<P>In accordance with the terms of the successful bid and requested improvements, TVX Gold proposes to purchase the Kassandra Mines assets for a purchase price of 11 billion GDr (approximately US$47 million at current exchange rates). The purchase price will be payable as follows:

   <OL TYPE=i>
   <LI>4.5 billion GDr (approximately US$19 million) upon the Closing Date
   <LI>6.5 billion GDr (approximately US$28 million) in five equal installments of 1.3 billion GDr (approximately US$5.6 million) on each of the first,  second, third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the Closing Date, plus interest thereon.
   </OL>

<P>It is anticipated that completion of the formal agreements and the closing of the purchaseof the assets should be concluded by the end of May.

<P>The Kassandra Mines assets are located on the eastern coastal region of the Chalkidiki Peninsula in north-eastern Greece, approximately 11 0 km east of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. They encompass mining concessions over a total area of 314 square kilometres and include the Olympias and Stratoni deposits, including three existing producing mines, base metal milling facilities capable of in excess of 3,000 Tpd and a ship loading facility on the Aegean Sea. These assets are being sold by the Liquidator on behalf of creditors. These operations have been uneconomic in the recent past, due largely to lack of modernization and to the non-availability of capital. The Olympias and Stratoni deposits have been mined for the last 30 years, operating as silver/lead/zinc mines. The gold content of the ore was not exploited due to its refractory nature. Although considerable time and money were spent studying the possibility of introducing a plant to recover the gold, this strategy was never implemented due to insufficient funding.

<P>TVX Gold tendered its bid pursuant to a formal auction process conducted by Ethniki Kephaleou S.A. as legal liquidator.  TVX had the opportunity to conduct extensive due diligence studies with its own personnel and expert consultants.  As a result of this due diligence, TVX Gold is confident that the current silver/lead/zinc operations can be rehabilitated and modernized to achieve an efficient, economic operation.  Further, with the introduction of proven pressure oxidation technology, previously tested by Sherritt Gordon and found suitable for the Kassandra refractory ores, the substantial gold potential of the mines can be profitably realized.  Studies to date indicate that gold recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable with the proven pressure oxidation technology.

<P>Current estimates of the total capital cost for this project are approximately US$180 million, to be spent over the next three years.  Of this amount, approximately US$32 million will be spent for the enhancement and modernization of the existing mining and milling operations, including environmental rehabilitation.  This will allow the existing silver/lead/zinc operations to be operating efficiently within 6 months of the Closing Date.  The balance of the capital of approximately US$148 million relates to the construction and implementation of the gold plant, which is anticipated to commence production at 50% capacity within 24 months of the Closing Date, with full capacity being reached one year later.

<P>Due to Greece's membership in and standing with the European Union, there are significant grants available for projects of this type, related to the introduction of new capital and technology, environmental initiatives and employment and retraining.  Because of the importance of this project to the Greek State, the Greek government has provided assurances to TVX Gold that all cooperation will be extended to ensure timely issuance of all necessary licenses and project approvals which may be required and the early approval and implementation of the grants to the maximum levels possible.


<P>The Kassandra Mines orebodies are massive sulfide replacement deposits within Paleozoic marble units often with schists or gneiss in the hanging wall of the ore.  Aplite dikes and sills are abundant in the mineralized zones.  Mineralization is zoned with respect to silver/lead/zinc, and gold mineralization.

<P>Information regarding existing reserves on the Kassandra properties, supplied by the Liquidator as part of the auction process and reviewed by TVX Gold personnel during their due diligence, indicates current reserves at Kassandra of approximately 14 million tonnes grading 6.3 g/t Au (approximately 2.8 million ounces of Au), 100 g/t Ag (approximately 500,000 ounces of gold equivalent), 3% Pb, and 4% Zn.  There is also an existing stockpile of arsenopyrite/pyrite of 250,000 tonnes grading 22.65 g/t Au (approximately 180,000 ounces of Au) and approximately 3 million tonnes of tailings with up to 3 g/t Au (approximately 300,000 ounces of Au).

<P>Based on current plans, TVX Gold anticipates that production of gold would commence approximately 24 months after the Closing Date, with the gold plant operating at approximately 50% capacity. TVX Gold expects production in this first year of operation to be in excess of 190,000 ounces of gold equivalent. In the next three years, when the plant is operating at full capacity, gold equivalent production is expected to exceed 300,000 ounces per year, which includes regular production from the existing mines plus treatment of the existing stockpiles and tailings. Thereafter, after the existing concentrate stockpiles are depleted, production would reduce to levels in excess of 180,000 ounces of gold equivalent per year (unless the further potential on the property justifies an expansion). The current mine plan estimates a mine life of approximately 20 years from the startup of the gold plant. Cash operating costs on a gold equivalent basis are anticipated to be less than US$200 per ounce, taking into account lead and zinc credits. Lead and zinc production, which will commence in the first year after closing, is estimated to reach, on an annualized basis, approximately 27,000 tonnes of zinc and 27,000 tonnes of lead, dropping to around 24,000 tonnes of zinc and 21,000 tonnes of lead annually, after six years of production.

<P>Based on the existing Kassandra Mines information supplied and due diligence work, there appears to be excellent potential for increases in reserves at the existing operations. Also, there are numerous other mineralized zones already identified on this large property, including two copper/gold porphyries, and a large manganese/gold zone. An extensive exploration program on the property will commence after closing.

<P>Toronto, Ontario, February 15, 1995 ... TVX GOLD INC. ("TVX") announces that it has entered into a letter agreement to form a joint venture with SANTA FE PACIFIC GOLD CORPORATION ("Santa Fe", NYSE: GLD) to explore and develop TVX's Gurupi gold property located in the State of Maranho, Brazil.

<P>Santa Fe can earn a 50% equity interest in the property in consideration of exploration expenditures totalling US$2 million over the next twenty-two months and property payments totalling US$1.8 million over the same period. TVX will contribute additional property payments totalling US$0.6 million.

<P>The property, which comprises approximately 31,700 hectares, is located some 350 kilometers south east of the city of Belm along the Gurupi river forming the border between the States of Par and Maranho. Gencor's Aurizona Property, soon to be in development, lies 120 kilometers to the north east of the property, in another trend but in a similar geologic setting. Gold occurrences in the area have been known since the early 17th century with the most recent mining and exploration activities occurring in the last fifteen years.

<P>The Gurupi shear belt is two kilometers wide and extends through the property for over twenty kilometers.  Gold is contained in volcano sedimentary rocks (tuffaceous rocks, graphitic phyllites, and volcanic conglomerates) intensely hydrothermalized and cut by sheared bands, quartz veins and veinlet zones. Two typological deposits are evident in gold works: quartz vein high grade and disseminate low grade. Channel sampling, geochemical sampling and two diamond drill rigs are ongoing on the property.

<P>Samples taken along strike over one kilometer of the shear zone in previously mined areas include 17 meters grading 1.75 gpt Au; 1 9 meters grading 1.08 gpt AU; 1 0 meters grading 1.90 gpt Au; and 19 meters grading 1.21 gpt AU - all open on both ends. Grades of 1 meter samples ranged from <0.05 gpt to 9.75 gpt.

<P>TVX Gold Inc. is a Canadian based growth oriented multinational mining company with significant existing production of precious metals from interests in six producing gold mines located in North and South America. TVX maintains its head office in Toronto, Canada, with major offices in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Santiago, Chile.

<P>Toronto, February 10, 1995 ... TVX GOLD INC. announces that it has increased its interest in the Braslia gold mine located in Paracatu, Brazil to 33%. TVX also increased its interest in the Kasperske Hory gold project in the Czech Republic to 100%.

<P>APSA, a private company controlled by Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of TVX Gold, has agreed to sell to TVX its 10.3% interest in the Braslia mine. The cost of the transaction is US$14 million or approximately US$33 per contained ounce based on current proven and probable reserve estimates. The Braslia mine has been in full commercial production since April, 1988, and annual production for 1994 was approximately 168,000 ounces of gold, at a cash cost per ounce of approximately US$196.

<P>With respect to the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic, TVX purchased the remaining 9.5% equity in Bohemia Dulni S.A., the Czech company which owns 1 00% of this gold property. TVX is currently carrying out a US$3 million exploration and development program on the property, consisting of 1,500 metres of drifting and 20,000 metres of drilling. The objective of this exploration program is to prove up to one million ounces of reserves by the end of 1995.

<P>As previously announced by officials in Greece, TVX Gold confirms that it submitted a formal bid proposal to purchase and develop the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, in accordance with the terms of the auction being conducted by the creditors of the bankrupt Greek company which owned these assets. Under the terms of the auction process it is anticipated that a determination of the winning bid will be made by the beginning of March.

<P>TVX Gold Inc. is a Canadian based growth oriented international mining company with existing production of precious metals from interests in six producing mines located in North and South America. TVX has its head office in Toronto, Canada with major offices in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Santiago, Chile.

<P>Toronto, Ontario, January 9, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc announces today that a fatality was sustained at its Deep Development project at the Casa Berardi Mine.

<P>Olivier-Levi Gauvin, 52, a miner with 30 years experience was fatally injured at Les Mines Casa Berardi, at 6:15AM, Saturday, January 7, 1995.  Mr. Gauvin is survived by his spouse Lucille Whynott Plourde.

<P>Mr. Gauvin, a former mining supervisor and instructor, was fatally injured during an underground safety inspection at a drift face in the Deep Development project of the mine.  It was determined by the Company's investigation, performed in conjunction with Worker Health & Safety representative of the Joint Occupation Health Committee, that Mr. Gauvin was struck by a second piece of loose that was released as he was scaling a primary target of loose.  The accident was witnessed by a fellow miner who is also experienced in this job function.  All proper authorities were contacted immediately after the accident and have visited the site.  Pending completion of normal investigations, the Company temporarily suspended all work in this heading of the Development project.  Regular mining operations at Casa Berardi were not affected and continue normally.

			<UL>
				<LI>TVX Gold poured the foundation for the mill at its 50% owned New Britannia project near Snow Lake, Manitoba, maintaining construction and shaft sinking on schedule, with a view to commencing production in the fourth quarter.
				<LI>The Company increased its interest in the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic to 100% and anticipates proving up reserves of one million ounces by year end. The 1995 exploration program includes underground development and surface and underground drifting.
				<LI>The Company was named the winning bidder for the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, proposing to purchase the assets for $46 million. After completion of a new autoclave plant, Kassandra is expected to produce in excess of 300,000 gold equivalent ounces annually in the initial years of full production and 200,000 ounces annually thereafter.
			</UL>
			<FONT SIZE=+2>Q2<BR></FONT>
			<FONT SIZE=+1>Second Quarter</FONT><BR>
			<UL>
				<LI>The Company acquired a 50% interest in the Asacha gold-silver deposit located in South Kamchatka, Russia and has the contractual right to increase its interest to 100%, subject to compliance with Russian laws. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work shows that a substantial amount of the identified reserve contains free gold and recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes.
				<LI>TVX Gold's share of gold equivalent from the La Coipa mine was 55,900 ounces in the second quarter compared to 49,800 ounces in the second quarter of 1994. Cash costs per ounce were $156 compared to $160 for the same period in 1994.
			</UL>
			<FONT SIZE=+2>Q3<BR></FONT>
			<FONT SIZE=+1>Third Quarter</FONT><BR>
			<UL>
				<LI>At the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project, the construction of a 45 kilometre all-weather access road was completed while exploration and feasibility studies continued. A production decision was made in the first quarter of 1996.
				<LI>The underground exploration drifting program at the Kasperske Hory project was expanded after achieving better than expected productivity in the second quarter.
				<LI>At the Company's Mineral Hill mine, a new ore zone was discovered down dip and adjacent to the existing Mineral Hill orebody. This new Ski Slope zone will be brought into production in the second quarter of 1996 supplementing output from the Mineral Hill deposit.
				<LI>At New Britannia, the Company's construction schedule remained on target. The primary crusher building and the installation of mill equipment were completed by mid-September. The mine was visited by the Honourable Gary Filmon, Premier of Manitoba.
			</UL>
			<FONT SIZE=+2>Q4<BR></FONT>
			<FONT SIZE=+1>Forth Quarter</FONT><BR>
			<UL>
				<LI>TVX Gold officially opened the New Britannia mine on November 14. At full capacity the mill will produce 100,000 ounces of gold per year.
				<LI>On December 21, TVX Gold announced the closing of its acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. The Company made an initial payment of $19 million and will make a further payment of approximately $27 million, payable in five equal annual installments plus interest.

			<IMG ALT="Eike F. Batista" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=200 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="/images/ebatista.jpg" BORDER=0>
			<P>The goal of TVX Gold Inc.s management team is to increase shareholder value by enhancing the Company's already substantial precious metal mining base. Specifically, by the year 2000, we plan to be producing over one 
million ounces annually and increase our reserves to 20 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent. In 1995, we continued to make steady progress towards achieving these objectives.
<P>Among the year's highlights were the start-up of the New Britannia mine in Manitoba and the completion of our purchase of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece.
<P>We brought our 50%-owned and operated New Britannia mine into production as planned in the fall, officially opening the mine on November 14. Its annual production is anticipated to average 100,000 ounces while ongoing exploration is expected to add significantly to the existing eight years of reserves.
<P>Our $46 million purchase of the Kassandra Mines assets was completed in December, adding approximately 4.3 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent to our reserves. We plan to construct an autoclave plant at this base metal operation in order to recover the gold in the ore which has previously been ignored due to its refractory nature. Gold equivalent production is expected to average 300,000 ounces annually during the initial years of operation and approximately 200,000 ounces per year thereafter over the life of the mine.
<IMG ALT="John W. W. Hick" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=200 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="/images/jhick.jpg" BORDER=0>			
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Financial Results</FONT>
			<P>TVX Gold's earnings in 1995 were $9.4 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to $22.8 million or $0.14 per share in 1994. Operating cash flow was $40.7 million or $0.26 per share, compared to $56.6 million and $0.36 per share in 1994. The decreases reflect higher operating and administrative costs, lower foreign exchange gains and increasing expenditures on exploration and business development as the Company pursues its aggressive growth strategy.
<P>Revenue in 1995 amounted to $156.9 million, similar to 1994's $157.2 million, resulting from the sale of 413,100 ounces of gold and gold equivalent in 1995 compared to 422,900 ounces in 1994. The Company's share of gold and gold equivalent production in 1995 was 423,100 ounces, approximately 3% less than the 1994 total of 436,900 ounces. Cash costs per ounce averaged $219, an increase of 10% over 1994's average of $199 per ounce, primarily as a result of higher unit operating costs, particularly at the Casa Berardi mine, and the effect of the appreciation of the local currency on operating costs at our Brazilian operations. TVX Gold's realized price averaged $380 per ounce, up from $372 per ounce in 1994.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Operations</FONT>
			<P>TVX Gold's production in 1995 was derived from its direct and indirect interests in seven mines located in North and South America.  The Company operates the New Britannia and Casa Berardi mines in Canada and the Mineral Hill mine in the U.S.A. New Britannia poured its first gold in November, while the Novo Astro mine in Brazil ceased operations in July, its ore reserves mined out after more than a decade of production.
<P>The 50%-owned La Coipa mine in Chile is one of South America's largest precious metals mines and one of the world's lowest cost producers.  It contributed 48% or 204,600 ounces of gold and gold equivalent to TVX Gold's total 1995 production, almost 5% more than in 1994.  Cash operating costs averaged $168 per ounce, down $3 from 1994.
<P>In Brazil, production from the 50%-owned Crixas mine in 1995 was marginally higher than the previous year.  It contributed 63,300 ounces of gold or 15% of TVX Gold's total production, at an average cash cost of $177 per ounce compared to $170 per ounce in 1994.
<P>The Company's share of production from the Brasilia mine increased by 40% in 1995 to 53,600 ounces of gold, contributing 13% of the total annual production of TVX Gold, primarily as a result of the Company increasing its equity interest in the mine by 10% to 33%, effective January 25, 1995.  Cash costs at this low grade open pit operation averaged $235 per ounce in 1995, up from $196 in 1994, primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.  A planned expansion at Brasilia, which should add a further 30,000 ounces of gold annually to TVX Gold's total production commencing in 1998, will bring economies of scale to the mine's operating costs in the future.
<P>Before its reserves were exhausted in mid-1995, the Novo Astro mine contributed 22,700 ounces of gold, or 5% of the Company's 1995 total production, which is approximately half of the mine's 1994 contribution.  Cash costs averaged $183 per ounce, considerably less than the $238 per ounce cost in 1994, essentially due to higher grades and the cessation of production.
<P>Production from the 100%-owned Mineral Hill mine in Montana was 34,900 ounces or 8% of the Company's 1995 total. Declining grades and tonnage resulting from the depletion of reserves in the original deposit were responsible for an 11% decline from the previous year's output. As a result of this lower throughput, cash costs were $359 per ounce, up from $321 in 1994.
Development of the new Ski Slope zone discovered in mid-1995 should allow production to return to the 40,000 ounce level in 1996, while in 1997, with the anticipated start-up of production from the Crevice Mountain orebody, output is planned to reach 60,000 ounces.
<P>In Canada, the 60%-owned Casa Berardi operation provided 36,700 ounces of gold, or 9% of the Company's production total in 1995. This is almost 40% less than in 1994 as a result of limited stope availability. Cash costs increased to $449 per ounce compared to $227 in 1994, partially because of a shortfall in development in 1994 resulted in increased emphasis on development in 1995.
<P>The New Britannia mine contributed 7,300 ounces of gold to TVX Gold's 1995 production total in the last month and a half of 1995. This operation is expected to reach commercial production levels in the second quarter of 1996.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Reserves</FONT>
			<P>TVX Gold increased its reserves by almost 69% in 1995. Proven and probable reserves contained 13.7 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent at year end, a significant jump from the 8.1 million ounces reported a year earlier. The increase reflects the inclusion of reserves from our Kassandra Mines and Asacha acquisitions and the Pachicutza project, as well as higher reserves at the Brasilia and Crixas operations and the Kasperske Hory project.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Projects</FONT>
			<P>As expected, the decision to put into production the Musselwhite property in northern Ontario was made in February 1996, upon completion of a final feasibility study. TVX Gold has a 32% interest in this project and our share of reserves amounts to approximately 730,000 ounces of gold. Production is expected to commence in 1997 at an annual rate of 200,000 ounces of gold and infill drilling is expected to prolong mining well beyond the 11-year mine life on which the production decision was made.
<P>In the Czech Republic, we continue to enhance the reserve potential of our 100%-owned Kasperske Hory project. As a result of our $3 million exploration and development program in 1995, we increased total reserves to one million ounces of gold. Exploration efforts in 1996 will focus on adding to reserves.
<P>Our exploration on the Pachicutza project in Ecuador continues with 1996 development including driving an adit into the deposit from which further exploration and development can be carried out. Under consideration is the construction of a mine capable of producing approximately 58,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually along with a by-product zinc-lead concentrate over a 6-year period. The plant from the Novo Astro mine has been purchased and will be moved to the Pachicutza site.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Acquisitions</FONT>
			<P>On December 21, 1995, TVX Gold completed the acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, TVX Gold made an initial payment of approximately $19 million and will pay a total of approximately $27 million in five equal annual installments plus interest.
<P>In connection with this acquisition, TVX Gold is to receive grants from the Greek state representing 35% of eligible capital expenditures on the Kassandra Mines project. In accordance with Greek law, the award of grants is subject to ratification by the Greek Parliament.
<P>TVX Gold also acquired a 50% interest in the Asacha gold-silver deposit in southern Kamchatka in 1995 and has the contractual right, subject to Russian law, to increase its interest to 100%. A feasibility study is planned for 1996 with a view to confirming the potential of the deposit to support a mining operation.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Future</FONT>
			<P>As we have noted in past years, TVX Gold's corporate strategy is to increase shareholder value by enhancing those key elements of our business that we can control and which most affect our share price. We pay careful attention to the quality and quantity of our reserves, to our production levels, cash costs, cash flow from operations and our earnings. In addition, our actions are conducted with full regard for our responsibilities, especially in the corporate responsibilities, especially in the areas of environment, health and safety, and community relations. At our existing operations there is continuing emphasis on cost reduction and the expansion of reserves and production. Beyond these operations we are seeking new growth in reserves and production through the acquisition, exploration and development of quality operations and properties with the potential for low operating costs and attractive profits.
<P>The Company's total production is planned to increase to 470,000 ounces of gold and gold equivalent in 1996, reflecting the contribution of the New Britannia mine. We should see further increases in production in 1997 due to higher planned output from Brasilia and Mineral Hill and initial production from Musselwhite. We expect to continue adding to and enhancing our reserves, through our acquisition strategy and our ongoing exploration and development programs. We are also optimistic about the reserve potential of the Kassandra Mines property.
<P>We would like to express our sincere appreciation to our directors and employees who, through their efforts, have made our many achievements to date possible.
<P>Our goal is to build our reserves to 20 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent while we increase annual production to over one million ounces by the year 2000. With major projects in Europe in addition to our North and South American operations, TVX Gold is committed to global success.

		<P><B>Cuiu-Cuiu, Brazil</B>
<P>The Cuiu-Cuiu project is located in the state of Para in northern Brazil, in the centre of the Tapajos gold province, the countrys oldest and largest gold producing area. The 25,000-hectare property is underlain by granites which are being investigated for their potential to host large volume, low grade gold deposits in hydrothermally altered stockwork zones as well as disseminated gold deposits in granite and tectonic breccias. Initial sampling and auger drilling have identified anomalous areas in saprolite material varying from 20 to 80 metres in width and with a strike extension of at least 1,500 metres. Drilling will be carried out in 1996 to test the property further.
		<P><B>Gurupi, Brazil</B>
<P>The Gurupi project, a 50/50 joint venture between TVX Gold and Santa Fe Pacific Gold, is located 350 kilometres southeast of the city of Belem along the Gurupi River. The 49,400-hectare property covers a 20-kilometre length of the 2-kilometre wide Gurupi shear belt. Gold is contained in metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks in two intensely mineralized parallel trends cut by shear and stockwork zones and quartz veins. Drilling to date has identified gold-bearing zones in saprolite and bedrock up to 2.5 kilometres in length and 15 to 60 metres thick with grades of about one gram of gold per tonne, and the potential for a reserve of over one million ounces. With four drills on the property, 20,000 metres of drilling in 200 holes is planned for 1996.
		<P><B>Volta Grande, Brazil</B>
<P>The Volta Grande project is located on the Xingu River, in the Amazon Basin, approximately 460 kilometres southwest of the city of Belem. The 15,100-hectare property lies in the famous Carajas mineral province associated with the Palmeiras greenstone belt. Its primary gold occurrences have been the target of garimpeiro activity. Preliminary exploration has identified three major targets on which drilling will be carried out in 1996 to investigate their potential for both low grade open pit and high grade underground mining operations.
		<P><B>Quimsacocha, Ecuador</B>
<P>TVX Gold has a 33% interest in the Quimsacocha project, a joint venture with Cogema and Newmont Overseas Explorations Limited. Located in the Azuay Province of south-central Ecuador, southwest of the city of Cuenca, the project covers a total of 12,250 hectares. Geological studies and geochemical and geophysical surveys have already identified six areas with anomalous gold-silver-copper values which will be tested for their bulk tonnage potential. A 28-hole, 3,120 metre drill program will be initiated in the first half of 1996.
		<P><B>Collon, Peru</B>
<P>The 12,000-hectare Collon project is located in central Peru, 17 kilometres north of the city of Huaraz in an area with excellent access and infrastructure. Initial drilling of a large gold-silver anomaly has yielded encouraging results, identifying mineralization in skarn and porphyry associated with a thrust fault around 25 metres thick. Future plans are to finish the first phase of drilling, for a total 1,400 metres, carry out a further 6,000 metres as a second drilling phase and continue exploration and trenching. The property is underlain by Cretaceous sediments intruded by Tertiary intrusives.

		<TD ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=100%>
<P>TVX Gold is committed to conducting its activities in a corporately responsible manner.
<P>TVX Gold places major emphasis on workplace health and safety at all of its operations. Safety training programs, designed to improve the safety awareness and performance of all employees both on and off the job, are conducted on an ongoing basis. As an example, the Brasilia mine has been awarded the British Safety Council's Sword of Honour three times, while the International Loss Control Institute has presented its 5-star award to the mine for an unprecedented six years in succession.

<IMG SRC="/images/environment.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=110 BORDER=0 ALT="Environment"><P><B>Environment</B>
<P>TVX Gold is very conscious of its corporate commitment and responsibility to maintain the ecological harmony wherever it conducts its activities. The Company's objective is to have all of its operations, whether they be at the exploration, development or mining stage, conform with or exceed recognized environmental standards for the industry. The Company constantly reassesses its performance in the environmental area.
<P>TVX Gold's operations and projects are located in diverse environmental settings around the world. They are found in the high Andes desert, the Ecuadorian rain forest and in Canada's Precambrian Shield. In contrast to these somewhat remote areas are those operations that are in close proximity to towns, such as Brasilia and New Britannia, or the Kasperske Hory project. A further contrast is the Mineral Hill mine which is adjacent to Yellowstone National Park in the state of Montana.
<P>Each mine develops an environmental program that ensures compliance with locally stated international guidelines while conforming to corporately imposed international environmental practices that ensure the impacts on the local environment are kept to a minimum.

<IMG SRC="/images/CorporateResponsibilities4.jpg" ALT="South American Operations" WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT><P><B>South America</B>
<P>The La Coipa mine, for example, is located in a desert environment at an elevation of 4,300 metres in the Andes Mountains where temperatures range from plus 35 degrees to minus 25 degrees Celsius. Water is obtained from wells beneath the Maricunga Salt Lake and transported through a 48-kilometre pipeline to the processing facilities. This method of obtaining process water ensures that the local wildlife and vegetation receive maximum benefit from the minimal natural precipitation that occurs in the area. At most mines, tailings generally have a water content of 50-60%. However, at La Coipa, dewatering is maximized through the implementation of one of the largest filtration systems in the mining industry. This system creates tailings with only 15-20% water, leaving the extracted water available for recycling in the mill circuit. The tailings are transported five kilometres in closed conveyors to the tailings storage facility where they are stacked like beach sand in a stable manner.
<P>The large tonnage, open pit, Brasilia operation is a good example of a mine that co-exists and cooperates with the neighbouring town of Paracatu. Because of its close proximity, Brasilia is concerned with dust, noise control and water quality. Dust levels are monitored at several sites on the property as well as at three locations in Paracatu. Access and internal roads are surfaced with laterite and sprayed constantly with water, while dormant mine areas are sprayed with lime solution to prevent wind-generated dust. All process water is directed to the tailings area and tested daily to check acidity levels, and the presence of cyanides, suspended solids, metals and oxygen. Groundwater monitoring wells downstream from the treatment and collection ponds are tested for the same substances.
<P>As mining proceeds at Brasilia, berms are constructed to screen the mine area, and planted with vegetation. The mine supports its own nursery, which employs four horticulturists, and is capable of providing 20,000 seedlings a year. Over 50,000 trees have been planted on site since the inception of operations. Brasilia's facilities also include an environmental simulation laboratory where chemists are able to assess control methods for potential contaminants.

<IMG SRC="/images/CorporateResponsibilities2.jpg" ALT="Mineral Hill Mine" ALIGN=right WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0><P><B>North America</B>
<P>Mineral Hill is perhaps TVX Gold's most striking example of a mine operated in harmony with its environment. Because of its proximity to Yellowstone National Park, the mine was designed at the outset to strictly protect the environment and has an exemplary record of environmental protection. The local community has been involved since the early days and a citizens' advisory committee continues to meet quarterly to discuss the operation.
<P>The mine has been specifically designed to blend in with its surroundings. Buildings are a neutral tan colour, pipes and electrical cables are buried and new road construction is minimal. Dust on the existing mine roads is controlled by applications of magnesium or calcium chloride, with other materials such as linseed oil also being tested for this purpose. Access to the Crevice Mountain deposit currently under development is by a tunnel originating from the Mineral Hill mine rather than by a surface road. Special fences have been erected to prevent bears and elk from entering the impoundment areas. Garbage is not allowed to accumulate and attract bears, but is transported directly to a solid waste disposal facility 80 kilometres away. Utility poles were redesigned to discourage eagles from roosting and the results were so successful that the local power company is now using similar poles elsewhere in Montana.
<P>Mineral Hill is operated as a zero-discharge facility. Water from the mine and mill is treated to neutralize cyanide and remove heavy metals, and is then recycled to the mill. Ongoing tests have also indicated that concentrations of nitrates in the mine water, resulting from the blasting process, can be reduced significantly by passing the mine water through a series of vessels containing naturally occurring bacteria. Under controlled conditions, biological denitrification has resulted in the reduction of nitrate to elemental nitrogen gas, and it is believed that this work may lead to the development of a low cost, low maintenance treatment for mine water which may be of value at non zero-discharge mines.
<P>Mill tailings at Mineral Hill are dewatered and stacked in thin lifts designed to withstand liquification in the event of an earthquake. The old tailings dumps, left from historic operations on the property, are being transferred to the Mineral Hill impoundment and the excavated areas are being recontoured and revegetated.
<IMG SRC="/images/CorporateResponsibilities5.jpg" ALT="Eagle" ALIGN=right WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=122 BORDER=0><P>One potential concern at Mineral Hill was an old arsenic plant, first operated in 1899, located beside Bear Creek which drains into the Yellowstone River. TVX Gold, through a voluntary reclamation program, removed the building to the tailings area, after documenting it as a historic structure, replaced a metre-thick layer of contaminated soil with new clean topsoil and introduced native grasses. Other historic buildings are being restored and preserved as appropriate, including the mine office, which is located in a building that was used for the same purpose 100 years ago.
<P>When mining is completed at Mineral Hill, the mine area will be restored to its original condition. It is estimated that this will involve re-establishing 80 acres of grassland and 13 acres of Douglas fir forest. 
<P>New Britannia represents TVX Gold's newest gold mine and, as such, employs the most advanced carbon-in-pulp technology to extract gold and the patented Inco SO2 cyanide destruction system to treat the process water. The operation's location within the town of Snow Lake calls for particular attention to be paid to dust and noise control. The location of a mine ventilation outlet on the town golf course demonstrates how residents and the mine can accommodate each other's interests.
<P>Environmental audits of each of the Company's North American properties were completed by the end of 1995.

<P><IMG SRC="/images/community.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 BORDER=0 ALT="Community Involvement"><B>Community Involvement</B>
<P>As one of its corporate responsibilities, TVX Gold supports the communities associated with its operations. This support takes many forms.
<P>At Mineral Hill, local baseball, basketball and bowling leagues have received contributions, as has the district 4-H program which instructs young people in agricultural skills, community service and personal development. Meetings are arranged to inform the community of Mineral Hill activities and the mine provides summer jobs for students from the local high schools and college. Local vendors are given the first opportunity to bid on the provision of supplies and services. The Chief Geologist conducts mine tours and educational programs for school groups.
<P>The Casa Berardi mine supports an industrial chair in borehole geophysics at Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal, and a local minor hockey team in the town of La Sarre. Bus transportation is also provided for employees for business purposes from La Sarre and two other locations to and from the mine.
<P>The New Britannia mine has contributed to hockey, curling and golf events, to local service groups and is establishing an annual scholarship for a college or university student. Employees are involved in a wide range of activities from serving on the town council and school board to leading Scout and Guide groups.
<P>Near La Coipa, the San Lorenzo School, strongly supported by the mine, provides education for about 400 pupils, from kindergarten age to 10 years. About 25% of the students are the children of La Coipa employees.
<P>In Rio de Janeiro, TVX Gold funds the Cruzada do Menor, an independent charitable organization which provides underprivileged children with food, improved education facilities and vocational training.
<P>At the Crixas operation, over 100 homes have been built for supervisors and operators in the local town, and a club has been built for employees and their families. A group of buildings was also converted into a school for 50 children and various local projects, such as the repair of a church roof, are supported.

<P><B>Dor</B>  impure mixture of metallic gold and silver produced through the smelting of gold and silver 
	concentrate, sand or precipitate. Typical impurities include base metals.

<P><B>Epithermal</B>  hydrothermal deposits formed at low temperature and pressure.

<P><B>Flotation</B>  a process for concentrating materials based on the selective adhesion of certain minerals to air bubbles in a mixture of water and ground-up ore. When the right chemicals are added to a frothy water bath of ore that has been ground to the consistency of talcum powder, the minerals will float to the surface. The metal-rich flotation concentrate is then skimmed off the surface.

<P><B>Footwall</B>  the mass of rock beneath a geological structure such as an orebody or fault.

<P><B>Formation</B>  the ordinary unit of geologic mapping consisting of a large and persistent stratum of rock.

<P><B>Gold equivalent</B>  silver expressed in equivalent ounces of gold using a conversion ratio dependent on prevailing gold and silver prices.

<P><B>Gravity separation</B>  recovery of gold from crushed rock or gravel using golds high specific gravity to separate it from lighter material.

<P><B>Grinding media</B>  material used to finely grind ore material to a size which allows recovery of the desired contained material.

<P><B>Hangingwall</B>  the mass of rock overlying a geological structure such as an orebody or fault.

<P><B>Hedging</B>  an arrangement which effectively offsets a price or exchange risk inherent in another transaction or arrangement.

<P><B>In-fill drilling</B>  drilling within a group of previously drilled holes to provide a closer spaced pattern to define more accurately the parameters of the orebody.

<P><B>Leaching</B>  the process in which a soluble metallic compound is extracted from ore by dissolving the metals in a solvent; see cyanidation.

<P><B>Level</B>  a horizontal opening in a mine; levels are usually established at regular intervals.

<P><B>Merrill-Crowe</B>  a precipitation process to recover precious metals using zinc dust to treat a de-oxygenated precious metals-cyanide solution.

<P><B>Mineralized zone</B>  any mass of host rock in which minerals of potential commercial value occur.

<P><B>Net smelter return</B>  an interest in a mining property held by the vendor on the net revenue generated from the sale of metal produced by the mine.

<P><B>Operating cost</B>  cash cost plus depreciation and amortization.

<P><B>Ore</B>  material that contains one or more minerals, at least one of which can be recovered at a profit.

<P><B>Ounces</B>  troy ounces of a fineness of 999.9 parts per 1,000 parts, equal to 31.1034 grams.

<P><B>Oxidized ore</B>  the alteration of metalliferous minerals by weathering and the action of surface waters and their conversion, partly or wholly into oxides, carbonates or sulfates.

<P><B>Phyllite</B>  scaly minerals, micas, chlorites and clays; a term more recently applied to minerals with a layered crystal structure.

<P><B>Porphyry</B>  rocks containing conspicuous phenocrysts in a fine-grained or aphanitic groundmass.

<P><B>Precipitate</B>  a mixture of mineral particles filtered from solutions as a result of a chemical reaction.

<P><B>Proterozoic</B>  the younger of two Precambrian systems or eras.

<P><B>Pyroclastic</B>  produced by explosive or aerial ejection of material from a volcanic vent.

<P><B>Pyroclastic deposits</B>  deposits made up mainly of rock material that has been expelled aerially from a volcanic vent.

<P><B>Reagent</B>  a chemical used in the mineral recovery process.

<P><B>Reclamation</B>  the process by which lands disturbed as a result of mining activity are reclaimed back to a 
	beneficial land use. Reclamation activity includes the removal of buildings, equipment, machinery, other physical remnants of mining, closure of tailings impoundments, leach pads and other mine features, and contouring, covering and revegetation of waste rock piles and other disturbed areas.

<P><B>Reserves</B>  that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Reserves are customarily stated in terms of ore when dealing with metalliferous minerals. There are three categories of reserves:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Proven ore</B>  material for which tonnage and grade are computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, underground workings or drill holes; grade is computed from the results of adequate sampling; and the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are so spaced and the geological character so well-defined that size, shape and mineral content are established.

<P><B>Probable ore</B>  material for which tonnage and grade are computed partly from specific measurements, samples or production data and partly from projection for a reasonable distance on geological evidence; and for which the sites available for inspection, measurement and sampling are too widely or otherwise inappropriately spaced to outline the material completely or to establish its grade throughout.

<P><B>Possible ore</B>  material for which quantitative estimates are based largely on broad knowledge of the geological characteristics of the deposit and for which there are few samples or measurements.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Resource</B>  mineralization based on geological evidence and assumed continuity. May or may not be supported by samples but is supported by geological, geochemical, geophysical or other data.

<P><B>Rod mill</B>  a mill using metal rods as the grinding mechanism.

<P><B>Room and pillar</B>  a method of mining flat-lying deposits in which the mined-out ore or rooms are separated by pillars of approximately the same size.

<P><B>Run of mine ore</B>  uncrushed ore in its natural state just as it is when blasted.

<P><B>Semi-autogenous mill</B>  a mill in which rock is reduced to smaller particles partially by grinding against other pieces of rock.

<P><B>Shaft</B>  a vertical passageway to an underground mine for moving personnel, equipment, supplies and material including ore and waste rock.

<P><B>Skarn</B>  the metamorphic rocks surrounding an igneous intrusive where the latter has come in contact with limestone or dolomite rocks.

<P><B>Spot price</B>  current delivery price of a commodity traded in the spot market, also called the cash price.

<P><B>Stope</B>  the working area in a mine from which ore is extracted.

<P><B>Stratigraphic</B>  pertaining to the composition, sequence and correlation of stratified rocks.

<P><B>Strike</B>  the direction, or course or bearing, of a vein of rock formation measured on a level surface.

<P><B>Stripping ratio</B>  the ratio of the amount of waste material which must be removed in an open pit to allow one ton of ore to be mined.

<P><B>Sulphides</B>  compounds of sulphur with other metallic elements.

<P><B>Tailings</B>  material rejected from a mill after the valuable minerals have been recovered.

<P><B>Tertiary</B>  the earlier of the two geologic periods in the Cenozoic era.

<P><B>Triassic</B>  the earliest of the three geologic periods comprised in the Mesozoic era.

<P><B>Vertical crater retreat (VCR)</B>  a method of mining ore underground in which holes drilled between sublevels are blasted in successive horizontal slices from bottom to top.

<P><B>Water management</B>  the process whereby the groundwater table in the mining area is lowered by pumping water from wells, and the water is conveyed and used or recharged to the groundwater system through infiltration, reinjection or irrigation return.

<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>


<P>TVX Gold Inc. reported a net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996 of US$23.3 million (US$0.14 per share), compared to net earnings US$1.3 million (US$0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 1995.  Net loss for the nine month period was US$13.2 million (US$0.08 per share) compared to net earnings of US$9.8 million (US$0.06 per share) in the corresponding 1995 period. During the quarter, the Company, as part of its ongoing review of its global operations, suspended the mining and milling operations at its Mineral Hill mine and placed the operation under care and maintenance.  As a result, the Company took a US$29 million one-time charge to earnings.  This charge was partially offset by gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which were primarily responsible for the other income of US$7.7 million.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1996 was 108,000 ounces (78,800 ounces of gold and 2,224,000 ounces of silver) compared to 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1995.  Year to date production was 320,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 311,100 gold equivalent ounces in 1995.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 92,900 ounces during the third quarter of 1996 was US$407 per ounce compared to US$383 per ounce on 107,900 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1995.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis for the third quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to US$239 from US$218, principally due to the reduction of mill throughput attributed to the hardness of ore encountered at La Coipa, the Company's principal mine and the high cost of production realized at the Mineral Hill mine prior to operations being suspended there, partially offset by the removal of contract miners at the Braslia mine and the diminished use of contractors at the Casa Berardi mine.

<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><CENTER><B>OPERATIONS REVIEW</B></CENTER></FONT>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in Chile in the third quarter of 1996 was 53,900 ounces (24,700 ounces of gold and 2,224,000 ounces of silver) compared to 46,700 ounces (32,700 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period, on a gold equivalent basis, increased to US$185 per ounce as compared to US$169 in the same period of 1995. The increase in cash costs is principally due to the reduction of mill throughput attributed to the hardness of ore encountered during the quarter.  

<P><B>CRIXS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixs mine in Brazil was 15,700 ounces in the third quarter of 1996 compared to 16,500 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$182 compared to US$164 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at the Crixs mine is primarily due to lower grade ore being encountered in 1996.

<P><B>BRASLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Braslia mine in Brazil was 14,000 ounces in the third quarter of 1996 compared to 13,600 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$191 compared to US$229 for the corresponding 1995 period.  The decrease in cash costs at the Braslia mine is primarily due to continued efficiencies achieved as a result of the removal of  contract mining and the introduction of the larger tonnage fleet of trucks.    

<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>During the quarter, the Company announced the suspension of mining and milling at its wholly-owned Mineral Hill mine in Montana, U.S.A.  The Company stated that the continued losses and capital expenditures necessary to continue the current operations at Mineral Hill are not justifiable.  TVX Mineral Hill will, however, continue the surface drilling program at Crevice Mountain to enable the Company to properly assess this resource which may justify mining on this project in the future.  Production at the mine decreased as a result of mining lower grade ore and an ongoing shortfall in mill feed from the main Mineral Hill mine.  As a result, cash operating costs at the mine had risen to US$524 on a year to date basis.  Year to date production amounted to 17,300 ounces of gold. Contributing to this situation were delays encountered in the Crevice tunnel drive, principally due to unexpected water inflows.  For these reasons, the mine, mill and associated facilities were placed on a care and maintenance basis.  The decision to suspend operations at Mineral Hill resulted in a charge to third quarter earnings of the Company of approximately US$29 million ($0.18 a share), including provision for future site reclamation.

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine in Quebec, Canada was 11,300 ounces in the third quarter compared to 8,300 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$354 compared to US$612 in the previous year.  The decrease in cash costs is primarily attributed to the diminished use of contractors on site.    

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the New Britannia mine in Manitoba, Canada was 9,200 ounces.  The mine commenced commercial production on August 1.  Cash costs for the months of August and September were US$316.  Underground production is increasing steadily with the ramp advance to the 650m level completed during the quarter.

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>The Company recently announced that the blockade which had been preventing full access to the Olympias mine at the Company's Kassandra project in Greece was lifted.  Certain of the communities and residents in the area of the Olympias mine had been blocking full access to the operations over concerns about mining in the area.  As a result of negotiations between senior Greek Government representatives and representatives of the said communities, the blockade was lifted and TVX Hellas, the Company's wholly-owned Greek subsidiary, commenced moving materials and equipment to the Olympias site to refurbish and reopen the mine and to plan the construction of the gold recovery plant.  During the quarter, ore production from the Madem Lakkos mine was ongoing, supplying feed to the Stratoni mill.  Lead / silver and zinc concentrates continue to be shipped from the Stratoni port.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>At the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project, Placer Dome Canada Limited, joint venture partner and operator, continues construction with substantial completion of the tailings dams, plant site surfacing and the pouring of the concrete foundation for the primary crusher achieved during the quarter.  The mill building cladding and roof sheathing are now also completed.  The construction project continues to be on schedule and below budget with production anticipated to commence in April 1997.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>Underground exploration drilling continued at TVX Gold's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic.  During the three month period, 160 metres of underground drifting and 3,840 metres of underground diamond drilling were completed.  The diamond drilling was directed towards exploring the westerly strike extension of the main auriferous zone.  Results to date have confirmed the presence of mineralization with drill intersections of similar grade and width to those obtained in 1995.  In addition to the exploration diamond drilling, a series of closely spaced small diameter holes drilled from the 700 metre level have shown the mineralization to be continuous over greater than 300 metres.  During the remainder of 1996, underground development and diamond drilling will continue to be concentrated on adding to the resource base by exploring to the west of the known mineralization.

<P>A pre-feasibility study being conducted by Davy International is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter of 1996.  As part of the pre-feasibility study, Lakefield Research, Ontario, Canada is conducting a series of metallurgical tests to determine the optimal gold recovery methodology.

<HR> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Operating activities in the third quarter of 1996 used $0.8 million, down from generating $16.9 million in the corresponding 1995 period, due to higher production costs and a 14% decrease in ounces sold as a result of delays in realizing sales at La Coipa.  Working capital requirements utilized $6.2 million primarily due to the payment of interest on the US$150 million unsecured Notes issued in January 1996, and inventory increases at La Coipa.  Excess inventories at La Coipa are expected to be sold in early 1997.

<P>In the third quarter of 1996, investing activities for mining property, plant and equipment increased to $42.6 million from $25.1 million in the same period in 1995.  These increases are related to the Kassandra mines assets, which were acquired in late 1995, and the development of the Musselwhite project.  Proceeds on investments of $17.9 million were the result of the Company liquidating its minority interest in publicly traded mining companies.  In 1995, the Company had acquired minority interest investments for $11.1 million.

<P>Financing activities utilized $1.1 million in cash compared to generating $5.2 million in 1995 when the Company commenced the drawdown of the New Britannia financing.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>The Company filed a Notice of Intention (the "Notice") to make a normal course issuer bid (the "Bid") with The Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSE") which was accepted by the TSE on August 16, 1996.  In the Notice, the Company provided for the purchase of up to a maximum of 5,000,000 common shares of its issued capital through the facilities of the TSE.  Such purchases are to be made at market prices at the time of purchase with the Bid expiring on the earlier of the date determined by the Company and August 19, 1997.  The Bid gives the Company the flexibility to purchase its shares for cancellation if it determines that, as a result of the difference between its view of the fundamental value of the shares and the market price, it is in the best interest of the Company to do so.  Shareholders may obtain a copy of the Notice, without charge, by contacting the Company.  To date the Company has purchased 604,000 shares.

<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>
	
<P>Net earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 1996 were $3,879,000 ($0.02 per share), compared to $2,900,000 ($0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 1995.  Net earnings for the six month period were $10,174,000 ($0.06 per share) compared to $8,490,000 ($0.05 per share) for the first six months of 1995.  During the second quarter, the Company had gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which were primarily responsible for the other income of $2,405,000 realized in the period.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1996 was 95,400 ounces (76,600 ounces of gold and 1,401,500 ounces of silver) compared to 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1995.  Year to date production was 212,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 216,800 gold equivalent ounces in 1995.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,200 ounces was $396 per ounce in the second quarter of 1996 compared to $383 per ounce on 103,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1995.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to $231 from $207.  This increase was due primarily to an ongoing shortfall in tonnage and the milling of lower grade ore at the Mineral Hill mine and a five week shut down of operations at the Casa Berardi mine stemming from a legal strike which was settled on May 27, 1996.

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>OPERATIONS REVIEW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the second quarter of 1996 was 45,700 ounces (26,900 ounces of gold and 1,401,500 ounces of silver) compared to 55,900 ounces (36,300 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis for the period increased to $189 as compared to $156 in the same period of 1995. The increase in cash costs and the decrease in production are primarily due to unfavourable weather conditions experienced during the quarter.
    
<P><B>CRIXS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixs mine was 15,700 ounces in the second quarter of 1996 compared to 15,700 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period were $176 compared to $194 in the same period of 1995.  The decrease in cash costs is primarily due to ongoing efficiencies achieved at the operations and the stabilization of the Brazilian currency.

<P><B>BRASLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Braslia mine was 13,300 ounces in the second quarter compared to 13,200 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.   Cash costs for the period were $197 compared to $228 in the previous year.  The decrease in cash costs is attributable principally to the ongoing efficiencies realized from the introduction of the wholly owned and operated fleet of 85 tonne trucks as well as the stabilization of the Brazilian currency.

<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The production from the Company's Mineral Hill mine was 5,200 ounces in the second quarter compared to 8,900 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.  Cash costs for the period were $604 compared to $341 in the corresponding 1995 period.  This decrease in production and increase in cash costs was a result of mining lower grade ore and an ongoing shortfall in mill feed from the main Mineral Hill mine.  The future operations at this property are currently being evaluated.
  
<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>During the period, the Casa Berardi mine experienced a legal strike which commenced April 19, 1996, resulting in a shut down of production, and was settled on May 27, 1996.  The strike was resolved with the assistance of a conciliator, management and the Casa Berardi Syndicat des Metallos d'Amerique Union members.  Under the terms of the new agreement, a three year contract was accepted, effective retroactively from March 7, 1996.  The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 9,000 ounces in the second quarter compared to 8,700 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were $335 compared to $423 in the corresponding 1995 period.

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the New Britannia mine was 6,500 ounces for the period.  The production rate is steadily improving as ongoing development work continues to add to the number of stopes available for production.  This development will partially offset the lower than planned ore grade currently being encountered which is expected to continue for the remainder of 1996.  To offset the lower ore grade, plans are in place to increase throughput.  It is expected that the operation will continue to show steady improvement in all key parameters for the remainder of the year.

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>Since the signing of the purchase contract in December 1995, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., has been concentrating on the comprehensive review and refurbishment of the existing operations comprised of the Olympias and Stratoni mills, the Olympias, Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres mines and the port facility at Stratoni.  A detailed environmental review is being undertaken and remedial work is currently underway.  The retraining of existing employees is also well advanced.  To date, the basic refurbishment and upgrading of the Stratoni mill has been completed with the Madem Lakkos mine currently operating to supply feed to the Stratoni mill.  The first shipments of lead/silver and zinc concentrates occurred in July.  Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the Greek Parliament passed the bill to ratify the Kassandra Mines purchase contract, including the related articles providing for the ratification of the 35 per cent grants from the Greek State and regulations for the timely issuance of all necessary licenses and permits in connection with the construction and operation of the gold recovery plant.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><CENTER>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</CENTER></B></FONT>

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>The Company and its joint venture partner, Placer Dome Canada Limited, the operator of the project, made a decision in February 1996 to construct a gold mine at the Musselwhite property at a capital cost of $190 million.  Construction work commenced during the quarter with the first major concrete pour of the milling facility building foundation.  Exploration work at the southern portion of the T-Antiform deposit and the Island and Pebble zones is ongoing with the objective of identifying readily accessible mineable resources to supplement initial mill feed for the project.  Production is expected to commence in the second quarter of 1997.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>During the second quarter, underground exploration work continued at TVX Gold's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project with the goals of adding additional ounces to the resource outlined in 1995 and further delineating the mineralization discovered to date.  Within the Golden Creek deposit, 240 metres of underground development and 5,470 metres of diamond drilling were completed.  Underground drilling continues to confirm the presence of auriferous mineralization.  Approximately 200 metres of development and 6,000 metres of diamond drilling remain to be completed during the 1996 exploration program.  A large percentage of this effort will be directed towards increasing the known resource base by drilling along strike to the west of the known mineralization.  

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>At the Company's Pachicutza project in Ecuador, the adit drive continued during the quarter allowing for further development and underground exploration work.  Underground development work continues to outline major vein systems as anticipated.  Reserve analysis along with engineering studies are underway and the definition of the reserves and completion of the engineering studies is expected in the fourth quarter.

<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><CENTER><B>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</B></CENTER></FONT>

<P>Cash flow provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 1996 was $3.9 million, down from $5.2 million in the corresponding period in 1995, primarily as a result of higher cash operating costs.

<P>Investing activities for mining properties, plant and equipment increased to $32.1 million from $18.8 million in the corresponding period in 1995 due to spending at the Kassandra Mines and the development of the Musselwhite mine.  The Company had a net outflow of $6.3 million in connection with the acquisition of equity investments including an interest in Valerie Gold Resources Ltd.

<P>Financing activities utilized $6.0 million in the quarter as compared to $9.1 million in the corresponding 1995 period, primarily as a result of the final loan payment made on the La Coipa project loan.

<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>

<P>Net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 1996 were $6,295,000  ($0.04 per share), representing an increase from $5,590,000 ($ 0.03 per share) in the first quarter of 1995.  During the first quarter of 1996, the Company realized significant gains on the disposition of minority equity investments, the most significant of which was the Gold Reserve shares acquired through the Brisas property settlement.
Gold equivalent production was 117,300 ounces (101,500 ounces of gold and 1,131,500 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1996 compared to 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995.
Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 91,400 ounces increased to $390 per ounce in the first quarter of 1996 compared to $ 378 per ounce on 101,400 gold equivalent ounces sold in the first quarter of 1995.  A significant portion of the difference between ounces produced and ounces sold relates to an increase in inventories at La Coipa.
Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis in the first quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to $230 from $225 principally due to increased costs at Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill which were partially offset by improvements at La Coipa. 

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>OPERATIONS REVIEW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the first quarter of 1996 was 59,200 ounces (43,400 ounces of gold and 1,131,500 ounces of silver) which compares to 45,700 ounces (28,800 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent ounce basis for the period decreased to $159 from $188 the previous year. The decrease in cash costs and increase in production are primarily due to higher grades of gold in the ore being mined and achieving higher plant recoveries.

<P><B>CRIXS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixs mine was 15,400 ounces in the first quarter of 1996 compared to 15,600 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.  Cash costs for the period were $186 compared to $191 in the same period of 1995.

<P><B>BRASLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Braslia mine was 12,800 ounces in the first quarter compared to 13,400 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period were $232 compared to $238 in the previous year. During the quarter, the Company and its joint venture partners approved plans for a two year expansion program of the current operation designed to increase annual production to 210,000 ounces of gold by the year 1999. On February 1, the new 85 tonne fleet of trucks was commissioned, and the mining contractor replaced. 

<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Mineral Hill mine was 8,200 ounces in the first quarter compared to 8,800 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. This decrease in production was a result of milling lower grade ore and reduced tonnage. Cash costs for the period were $422 compared to $370 in the previous year. Ore was intersected on the Ski Slope decline indicating that access to the main Ski Slope ore reserve block will occur by the end of the second quarter. The development of the Crevice tunnel is progressing and at March 31, 1996, 1.9 kilometres of the total planned tunnel length of approximately 4 kilometres was completed.

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 12,700 ounces in the first quarter compared to 9,500 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce for the first quarter were $370 compared to the previous year when cash costs were $277 per ounce. Quarter over quarter, cash costs are expected to continue to decline.  The increase in production reflects the ongoing production improvements being achieved at the mine compared to the prior year.  Production was 1% below plan while total development realized was 7% below plan, principally due to low production in January. Total backfill achieved was 20% above plan allowing the mines to catch up on their backlog. The Deep Development program is nearing completion with approximately 350 metres of development needed to join the Est and Ouest mines through the Principale Zone. The Principale Zone has been intersected by an access drift. A legal strike commenced April 19 after unionized workers rejected the final offer by the Company. During the strike, the mine was under the care and maintenance of senior staff.  On May 27, with the assistance of a mutually agreed conciliator, management and the Casa Berardi Syndicat des Metallos d'Amerique Union members agreed to a 3 year contract, effective retroactively from March 7, 1996.  The overall cost of the contract averages 4.5% per year. 

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the New Britannia mine was 9,000 ounces for the first quarter of 1996. The initial ore mined from the satellite No. 3 Zone was milled in its entirety by March 31. Main mine tonnage scale up was adversely affected by lower grades at the Toots Zone and slower than planned main mine development. To supplement feed while ongoing development is being performed at the main mine, a 25,000 tonne test pit is being implemented at the Birch Zone. By the end of the second quarter, it is anticipated that four long-hole stopes will be available for mining from the main mine and tonnages should approach 1,400 tpd. The revised projected production for 1996 is estimated at 75,000 ounces, 25% below the planned 100,000 ounce annual production.

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., 100% owner of the Kassandra Mines, encountered delays at the Olympias mine as local protestors restricted the passage of equipment and materials to the site.  At the Stratoni mill, base metal operations resumed.  TVX Hellas completed the basic refurbishment of the Stratoni mill over the ten weeks prior to its being put into production.  The refurbishment included upgrading the facility, modernizing and enhancing existing flotation cells, updating certain machinery and replacing reagent lines.  The Stratoni mill plans to produce a lead-zinc concentrate at a rate of 700 tpd with mill feed from the nearby Madem Lakkos underground mine where mining has recommenced.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>The Company and its joint venture partner, Placer Dome Canada Limited, the operator of the project, made a decision in February to construct a gold mine at the Musselwhite property in northwestern Ontario at a capital cost of $190 million. Development of a mine and construction of processing facilities started immediately in order to commence production in the second quarter of 1997.  Reserves are estimated to be 2,100,000 ounces of gold for an estimated mine life of ten years at a projected production rate of approximately 200,000 ounces of gold annually. The mill will be designed for a production rate of 3,300 tonnes per day (1,204,500 tonnes per year). Processing facilities will employ conventional gravity separation, cyanide leach and carbon-in-pulp (CIP) processes. The ore is free milling, providing gold recoveries of approximately 95%. Cash production costs are estimated at $200 per ounce.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>During the first quarter of 1996, exploration work at TVX Gold's Kasperske Hory project was directed largely towards following up surface diamond drilling results from 1995's successful exploration program. Within the Golden Creek Deposit, 4,600 metres of underground drilling and 313 metres of underground development were completed.  The majority of the drill holes intersected their targets as planned, confirming the initial interpretation of the mineralization. During the remainder of 1996, additional diamond drilling and underground development is planned in an attempt to further define the known mineralization and increase the reserve base.

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>At the Company's Pachicutza project in Ecuador, an adit is being driven into the deposit to permit development and further exploration. The 1996 development program calls for 6,000 metres of drilling, 600 metres of tunnelling and 180 metres of underground drifting along high grade structures. This work is being conducted in anticipation of an operation producing approximately 58,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually, with a by-product zinc-lead concentrate, for an estimated mine life of six years.

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Cash flow from operations increased to $16.5 million in the first quarter of 1996, from $2.2 million in the comparable 1995 period, as a result of the improvements in working capital due to reduced funding of the joint venture partner for New Britannia and proceeds received from the settlement of the Casa Berardi insurance claim. Major expenditures in 1996 include the expansion of the Braslia mine, the development of the Kassandra Mines and the Musselwhite project . As well, the Company purchased the commitment to issue 400,000 shares to Royalstar Resources for Cdn $2 million.

<P>During the first quarter of 1996, the Company realized $26.4 million from the sale of equity investments which included $14.3 million on the disposition of the Gold Reserve shares and warrants received as part of the settlement of the Brisas property dispute in Venezuela.

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>PRIVATE PLACEMENT</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In January 1996, TVX Gold completed a private placement in the United States of $150 million Unsecured Senior Notes bearing interest at 7.51% and due January 15, 2001.  The Notes were sold to several U.S. life insurance companies.  Approximately $20,000,000 of the proceeds were used to repay drawings on operating bank lines.  The balance is available for anticipated capital expenditures, for the acquisition, exploration and development of mining prospects and for general corporate purposes.

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>MANAGEMENT</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In May, the Company announced the strengthening of its Senior Operating Management Team with the appointments of Mr. David Murray as President and Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Clifford J. Davis as Senior Vice President, North American Operations.  The Company also anticipates the announcement of a third member of this Senior Operating Management Team as Senior Vice President, European Operations.  The Company also announced that Mr. John Hick will now serve in the capacity of Vice Chairman of the Corporation.

<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>


<P>Net earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 1995 were US$1,349,000 (US$0.01 per share), compared to US$13,319,000 (US$0.08 per share) in the third quarter of 1994.  Net earnings for the nine month period were US$9,839,000 (US$0.06 per share) compared to US$19,181,000 (US$0.12 per share) in the corresponding 1994 period. In 1994, the higher net earnings for both the first nine months and the third quarter reflect one time interest and foreign exchange gains which resulted principally from the appreciation of the Brazilian currency, the Real.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1995 was 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) compared to 111,100 ounces (88,900 ounces of gold and 1,604,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1994.  Year to date production was 311,100 gold equivalent ounces compared to 331,200 gold equivalent ounces in 1994.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales during the third quarter of 1995 of 107,900 ounces was US$383 per ounce compared to US$373 per ounce on 96,800 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1994.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the third quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$218 from US$190, principally due to increased operating costs at certain mines and lower production at the North American operations and La Coipa. However, the improved revenue results at the La Coipa Mine reflect a draw down in inventories and higher realized revenues. The continued appreciation of the Brazilian currency accounted for higher costs during the period at the Company's Brazilian operations. 

<P>At the Mineral Hill Mine, third quarter production was in line with the comparable 1994 period, while year to date production was lower than 1994 reflecting the mining of lower grade ore as the main orebody reaches the end of its expected life. The newly identified Ski Slope zone, adjacent to the Mineral Hill orebody, is currently being developed and will provide continued production at a mining grade of 7.2 grams per tonne, until the completion of the Crevice tunnel project. Gold production at Casa Berardi was significantly lower than 1994 levels due to lower grade ores and an  increased emphasis on development and exploration.  

<P>The Company expects that improved production levels in the fourth quarter will result in average cash costs in 1995 of approximately US$215 per ounce.

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>OPERATIONS REVIEW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa Mine in Chile in the third quarter of 1995 was 46,700 ounces (32,700 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) compared to 53,500 ounces (31,300 ounces of gold and 1,604,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent  ounce basis for the period increased to US$169 as compared to US$157 in the same period of 1994. The increase in cash costs and the decrease in production are primarily due to the mining of lower head grades during the period.    

<P><B>CRIXS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixs Mine in Brazil was 16,500 ounces in the third quarter of 1995 compared to 17,600 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decrease in production is attributable to mining lower grade ore. However, throughput at the mill continues to exceed plan and the Crixs Mine is on target to increase its annual throughput to 485,000 tonnes for 1995 compared to 453,000 tonnes milled in 1994.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$164 compared to US$133 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at the Crixs mine is primarily due to lower production in the period and the appreciation of the Brazilian currency. 

<P><B>BRASLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Braslia Mine in Brazil was 13,600 ounces in the third quarter compared to 9,600 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest in the Braslia Mine effective January 25, 1995, raising the Company's effective interest in the operation to 33%.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$229 compared to US$151 for the corresponding 1994 period.  The increase in cash costs at the Braslia Mine is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.  Production efficiencies are anticipated to improve in the first quarter of 1996 with the introduction of a fleet of 85 tonne trucks which will replace the 20 tonne trucks currently used.   

<P><B>NOVO ASTRO</B>

<P>The planned closure of the Novo Astro Mine in Brazil which reached the end of its mine life in June 1995 will be completed by year end 1995.  The 1,200 ounces of production registered in the quarter were the result of remnants recovered during mill clean up.

<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Mineral Hill Mine in Montana, U.S.A. was 8,000 ounces in the third quarter compared to 8,800 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs for the period were US$392 compared to US$396 in the previous year. The advancement of the Crevice tunnel continues, however at a slower than anticipated rate, due to unexepected ground water encountered.  The Company's efforts at grouting in the tunnel drive have been successful and the tunnel is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1997.  The recently discovered Ski Slope Zone will be in production in the first quarter of 1996.  It is anticipated that, based on the Company's current information and ongoing drilling, the deposit will contribute sufficient production until the Crevice reserves are developed.   

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi Mine in Quebec, Canada was 8,300 ounces in the third quarter compared to 12,900 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$612 compared to US$227 in the previous year.  The increase in cash costs and decrease in production during the third quarter reflect the operational transition period encountered at the mine in which emphasis was placed on development of multiple feed sources. To accelerate this program, a contractor was retained.  The deep development program continues with shaft sinking completion scheduled for the fourth quarter.

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>Officially opened, subsequent to the end of the quarter, on November 14, 1995.  

<P>The Company, as the operator of the project, maintained its construction schedule on target at its 50% owned New Britannia Mine in Manitoba, Canada.  During the period, long hole drilling of the No. 3 Zone orebody commenced along with development work at the 1,780 metre level.  Erection and completion of the primary crusher building occurred while the installation of mill equipment was finalized by mid-September.  By the end of September, crushed waste was fed into the fine ore bin in preparation for start-up.  The mill processing facilities are expected to operate on a 24 hour day, 365 days per year schedule at an operating availability of 96% and a rated throughput of 78 tonnes per hour to average 1,800 tonnes per day.  The crushing facility is expected to operate 12 hours per day.  The mill is expected to process 665,000 tonnes per annum, recovering approximately 100,000 ounces of gold.

<P>In anticipation of the official mine opening, the Honourable Gary Filmon, Premier of Manitoba, visited the site during the quarter.

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>Exploration work and feasibility studies continue at the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project in Ontario, Canada, with a  production decision expected in early 1996.  Total costs for the 1995 program are expected to be approximately $15 million and include the construction of a newly-completed 45 kilometre all-weather access road to the property and a feasibility study.  Preliminary indications are that this underground, shaft accessed property will be mined and milled at a rate of approximately 1.4 million tonnes of ore per annum to produce approximately 250,000 ounces of gold annually.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>At the Company's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic, the underground drifting program continues on course to achieve 2,350 metres of total development.  Surface drilling results continue to confirm mineralized systems along strike.  Underground drilling work is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter.  The Company is evaluating the continuance of further underground drifting and drilling plans for 1996, as findings to date remain positive, and in accordance with expectations.

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>During the period, the Company realigned its drilling and exploration program at the Pachicutza project in Ecuador.  The initial exploration program focused on large tonnage, low grade zones which, to date, have proved to be uneconomic.  However, after careful consideration, the Company has switched its exploration program to smaller high grade zones.  Pending positive results from these zones, the Company anticipates commencing a feasibility study in 1996.

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>Discussions aimed at the completion and signing of the contract to purchase the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, continue.  The Company remains confident that the transaction will soon close and the Greek government continues to affirm its support in this process.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>Cash flow provided by operating activities in the third quarter of 1995 was US$16.9 million, down from US$25.6 million in the corresponding period in 1994, as higher sales revenues were offset by higher cash costs of production and exploration spending during the 1995 period increased compared to the prior year period.  The higher overall cash flow in 1994 reflects the realization of one time interest and foreign exchange gains.  Improvements in working capital increased cash flow, principally as a result of the Company completing, during the quarter, the financing of the development of the New Britannia Mine.

<P>Investing activities for mining properties, plant and equipment remained relatively consistent at US$25.0 million in the third quarter of 1995 from US$27.3 million in the prior period.  Spending in 1995 was the result of requirements at the La Coipa, Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill mines, the development of the New Britannia Mine, costs related to acquiring new properties in Greece and the recently acquired interests in properties in Kamchatka, Russia.  Investments in other assets increased to US$11.2 million from US$1.5 million in 1994 as a result of strategic minority interest investments in publicly traded mining companies.

<P>Financing activities generated US$5.2 million in the quarter compared to US$2.3 million in the same period of 1994.  Cash generated from the issuance of share capital in the third quarter was significantly reduced as compared to the 1994 third quarter, as 1994 included shares issued for the acquisition of mining properties.  Net long-term debt financing resulted in an increase in cash of US$10.1 million as a result of the first draw down on the New Britannia Mine project financing completed during the third quarter.  The total facility is US$28 million, of which US$21.4 million had been received as of September 30.

<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>


<P>Net earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 1995 were US$2,900,000 (US$0.02 per share), compared to US$2,547,000 (US$0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 1994.  Net earnings for the six month period were US$8,490,000 (US$0.05 per share) compared to US$5,862,000 (US$0.04 per share) for the first six months of 1994.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1995 was 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) compared to 112,200 ounces (86,700 ounces of gold and 1,829,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1994.  Year to date production was 216,800 gold equivalent ounces compared to 222,600 gold equivalent ounces in 1994.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,000 ounces was US$383 per ounce in the second quarter of 1995 compared to US$370 per ounce on 118,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1994.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$207 from US$192, principally due to decreased grade and tonnage at certain mines.  In particular, at the Mineral Hill mine, throughput declined as a result of lower grades, while gold production at the Casa Berardi mine decreased due to lower plant throughput, head grade and plant recovery.

<P>Cash costs at the Brazilian operations reflected an appreciation of the Brazilian currency, while production at both the Braslia and Crixs mines were as planned.  The Novo Astro mine, which began shut down operations late in the second quarter, benefitted from higher than planned plant throughput as it reached the end of its mine life.  The La Coipa mine posted a strong quarter as it benefitted from higher than planned head grades and recoveries.

<P>The Company anticipates that continued improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately US$200 per ounce compared to US$199 per ounce in 1994.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>OPERATIONS REVIEW</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the second quarter of 1995 was 55,900 ounces (36,300 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) compared to 49,800 ounces (24,300 ounces of gold and 1,829,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis for the period declined to US$156 as compared to US$160 in the same period of 1994. The decrease in cash costs and the increase in production are primarily due to mining higher head grades and achieving higher plant recoveries somewhat offset by lower than planned plant throughput during the period.    

<P><B>CRIXS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixs mine was 15,700 ounces in the second quarter of 1995 compared to 17,000 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decrease in production is attributable to mining lower grade ore. Throughput at the mill continues to exceed plan. The Crixs mine is on target to increase its annual throughput to 485,000 tonnes for 1995 compared to 453,000 tonnes milled in 1994.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$194 compared to US$172 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at the Crixs mine is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.  Cash costs are expected to be less than $200 for the year. 

<P><B>BRASLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Braslia mine was 13,200 ounces in the second quarter compared to 9,400 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest in the Braslia mine on January 25, 1995, raising the Company's effective interest in the operation to 33%.  Cash costs per ounce of gold of US$228 for the period is the same as the previous year.  Management at the mine continues to improve performance by increasing throughput. Further production efficiencies are anticipated with the introduction in the first quarter of 1996 of 85 tonne trucks which will replace the current 20 tonne trucks. Cost efficiencies commensurate with the introduction of the new fleet are expected as early as the second quarter of 1996. A study is also underway to examine the feasibility of increasing throughput to 18 million tonnes per year from the current 13 million tonnes.   

<P><B>NOVO ASTRO</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Novo Astro mine was 11,600 ounces in the second quarter compared to 9,600 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period.  In the period cash costs per ounce of gold were US$135 compared to US$254 in the previous year.  Novo Astro's production reflects the mining of the remaining high grade stopes of the mine and the shutting down of the facility.  An orderly shutdown of the operations commenced in the quarter.
     
<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Mineral Hill mine was 8,900 ounces in the second quarter compared to 12,900 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. This decrease in production was a continued result of milling lower grade ore and a 25 tonnes per day shortfall in tonnage. Cash costs for the period were US$341 compared to US$253 in the previous year. During the period, a new zone was discovered down dip and adjacent to the Mineral Hill ore zone which will allow flexibility to improve tonnage and grade production.  The development of the Crevice tunnel is behind schedule by approximately two months due to unexpected ground water conditions.  Approximately one quarter of the distance has been developed.  It is still anticipated the Crevice tunnel can meet its targeted completion schedule of November 1996.

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 8,700 ounces in the second quarter compared to 13,500 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$423 compared to US$216 in the previous year.  The increase in cash costs and decrease in production reflects the temporary suspension of mining in a high grade stope due to poor ground conditions, as well as lower than planned tonnage and an increased emphasis on development  of mining stopes.   The loss of the primary stope prevented accelerating the development of the lower, intermediate and West zones.  To facilitate this work, a contractor has been hired to enable the advancement of these zones.  The deep development program continues on schedule with shaft sinking completion scheduled for the fourth quarter.  Development of the Principale zone will begin in the 4th quarter as planned.  Exploration work to date continues to show excellent potential.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>MINE UNDER DEVELOPMENT</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA </B>

<P>At the Company's 50% owned New Britannia mine, both underground development and surface construction remain on schedule and on budget with mill commissioning expected to begin in the third quarter. Mineable reserves stand at approximately 4.1 million tonnes grading 6.6 grams of gold per tonne for a total of 862,000 ounces. Mine site exploration is ongoing and a comprehensive evaluation of potential satellite zones on the property continues.  No. 3 zone ore continues to be stockpiled and will be ready for processing at the start-up of the mill. Once operational, the mill will have an estimated throughput capacity of 660,000 tonnes, for an annual production rate of approximately 100,000 ounces of gold.  With start-up scheduled to begin in the third quarter, this mill will contribute to production in the fourth quarter.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>Exploration work at the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project continues to delineate additional reserves. A feasibility study is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1995 with a production decision anticipated thereafter. To date, an all weather road is in place and evaluation of the construction of a power line in 1996 is underway. Assuming a positive production decision in the first quarter of 1996, early indications are for the start up of production to commence in the fourth quarter of 1997.  Total proven and probable reserves are currently estimated at 3.2 million ounces of gold.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>At the Company's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project, an accelerated US$3 million drilling program to prove up one million ounces of gold reserves remains on target. Continued drilling results are encouraging and support the presence of mineralized systems extending past the initial target areas with some veins being traced for over 200 metres in length. Drift expansion work has rendered better than expected productivity adding 850 metres to the previous 1,500 metres. A feasibility study could commence as early as 1996.

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>The Company continues its exploration program at its  92% owned Pachicutza project in Ecuador. A number of gold-bearing zones have been identified, however, some of the large low grade resources initially identified have not proved to be economic but investigation work continues.  Meanwhile, the main focus of the drilling and evaluation efforts is currently directed towards several smaller, higher grade zones.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>NEW PROJECT</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>The Company  remains confident that the closing will occur this fall as all material terms of the purchase have been agreed on.  In anticipation of closing, engineering, procurement and environmental work is ongoing.  As part of the Company's ongoing planning of the project, it is anticipated that all three existing operations will remain in production. Plans to commence environmental rehabilitation, to retrain miners, and to enhance and modernize the existing operations upon the signing of the agreement are in place. 

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>RECENT ACQUISITION</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>ASACHA AND RODNIKOVOE</B>

<P>The Company recently undertook a careful step into a new geographical area when it announced the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Asacha and Rodnikovoe gold/silver deposits located in South Kamchatka, Russia through the acquisition of  50% of the outstanding shares of Trevozhnoye Zarevo ("TZ"), a Russian company. The Company is entitled to a majority representation on the board of TZ and has the contractual right to increase its interest to 100%, subject to compliance with Russian laws. The Asacha and Rodnikovoe deposits are located in the Southern Kamchatkan gold-silver belt, within 60 and 100 kilometres respectively, of the provincial capital of Petropavlovsk and are accessible by a primitive road. The mineralization style is the classic high-grade, bonanza epithermal-vein type, associated with recent volcanism of the circum Pacific region. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work has shown that a substantial amount of the identified reserves contain free gold and that recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes. Based on Russian reserve estimates, these deposits contain approximately 2.28 million ounces of gold and 12.9 million ounces of silver, or a total of 2.45 million ounces of gold equivalent at today's prices.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>Cash flow provided from operations in the second quarter of 1995 was US$5.2 million, down from US$14.9 million in the corresponding period in 1994.  This reduction is primarily due to changes in the Company's silver hedging position and additional working capital requirements primarily related to funding our joint venture partner's contributions to the New Britannia project.

<P>Investing activities for mining properties, plant and equipment increased significantly to US$18.8 million from US$4.8 million in the prior year largely due to the expansions at the Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill mines and the development of the New Britannia project.  During the quarter, the Company sold its 44% equity interest in CMA for net proceeds of US$8.9 million.  CMA holds a 71% interest in the Novo Astro mine which represented a 31% indirect investment for TVX Gold.  The sale provided for adjustments to the price to reflect the ceasing of production at Novo Astro in the quarter.  The Company retains its 19% direct interest in the Novo Astro mine. 

<P>Debt repayments during the second quarter were primarily related to the La Coipa project loan and were similar to debt repayments in the previous year.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>MANAGEMENT CHANGES</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>Recognizing the rapid growth of the Company both at existing operations and new international projects, the Company strengthened its operating group with the addition of two senior individuals.  On June 1st, Gary E. German was appointed a Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer responsible for overseeing all operating and development projects of the Company.  Also, Mr. Frank X. Koch has recently been appointed Project Director for the Kassandra project in Greece.  He had most recently been with Noranda Inc. as the Group's Vice President, Engineering.

<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>

<P>Net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 1995 were $5,590,000 ($0.03 per share), an increase from $3,315,000 ($0.02 per share) in the first quarter of 1994. Contributing to the increase in earnings in 1995 was an accounting gain of $7.5 million, which was recorded by the Company in January 1995, resulting from the settlement of the Brisas property lawsuit in Venezuela. As part of the settlement, TVX received 1.5 million shares of Gold Reserve Corporation, a corporation listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. During the quarter, the Company reduced its outstanding silver position based on its assessment of the silver market, which partially offset the Brisas gain.      

<P>Gold equivalent production was 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995 compared to 110,400 ounces (91,800 ounces of gold and 1,341,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1994.

<P>The realized price for gold in the first quarter of 1995 was $378 per ounce (1994 - $378) and for silver was $4.43 per ounce (1994 - $4.89).  Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 101,400 ounces was $375 per ounce in the period compared to $373 on 96,200 gold equivalent ounces sold in the same period of 1994.
 
<P>Cash costs on a gold equivalent basis in the first quarter of 1995 increased to $225 per ounce from $193 in the same period of 1994, principally due to decreased grade and tonnage. Higher operating costs at La Coipa, lower grades at Mineral Hill, and decreased mill throughput and lower grades at Casa Berardi were contributing factors to the overall increase in cash costs. The Brazilian operations results reflect an  increase in local costs due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.

<P>The Company anticipates that improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately $200 per ounce compared to $199 per ounce in 1994.

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the first quarter of 1995 was 45,700 ounces ( 28,800 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) which compares to 48,000 ounces (29,400 ounces of gold and 1,341,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1994 period. Cash cost on a gold equivalent ounce basis for the period increased to $188 from $163 the previous year. The increase in cash costs was primarily due to an increase in the consumption of zinc and cyanide during the quarter, which was required as a result of the changing nature of the ore. In addition, normal mill maintenance scheduled for later in 1995 was advanced to the first quarter.

<P>As well, La Coipa experienced a decline in milling throughput in the quarter, which has returned to target rates during the second quarter. The mine plan indicates cash costs of $170 per ounce for the year.    

<P><B>CRIXS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixs mine was 15,600 ounces in the first quarter of 1995 compared to 11,500 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is attributable to increased mill throughput. Cash costs for the period were $191 compared to $184 in the same period of 1994.  The increase is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.  As a result of planned modifications to the mill, the Crixs mine is expected to increase its annual throughput to 485,000 tonnes for 1995 compared to 453,000 tonnes milled in 1994. 

<P><B>BRASLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Braslia mine was 13,400 ounces in the first quarter compared to 9,300 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest in the Braslia mine on January 25, 1995, raising the Company's effective interest in the operation to 33%.  Cash costs for the period were $238 compared to $194 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at Braslia reflect the appreciation of the Brazilian currency  and the mining of lower grade ore. During the first quarter, the Braslia mine received, for an unprecedented sixth consecutive year, the five star award of excellence from the National Occupational Safety Association.

<P><B>NOVO ASTRO</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Novo Astro mine was 9,800 ounces in the first quarter compared to 12,400 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decline in production is the result of changing grades as the winding down of operations at Novo Astro commences. Plans are in place to facilitate an orderly shutdown, now scheduled for July, 1995. At $226 per ounce, cash costs were comparable to $225 per ounce recorded in the previous year.  
     
<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The Company's 100% owned Mineral Hill mine produced 8,800 ounces of gold in the first quarter compared to 12,900 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. This decrease in production was a result of milling lower grade ore.  Cash costs for the period were $370 compared to $269 in the previous year. In order to offset future declines in production and decrease cash costs, plans are in place to accelerate the exploration and development program in the lower levels of the mine. In view of the face that new stoping areas are at least two months away, production and grade are expected to remain at approximately current levels for the second quarter. The development of the Crevice tunnel is progressing satisfactorily and at March 31, 1995, 3/4 of a kilometre of the total planned length of approximately 4 kilometres of the tunnel was complete. 

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 9,500 ounces in the first quarter compared to 16,300 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decrease in production  reflects the shutdown of operations at a high grade heading following a fatality in January, 1995. In addition, ongoing mine development was delayed.  Cash costs for the period were $277 compared to $213 in the previous year. Although first quarter results were disappointing, efforts continue to maintain production while the deep development program continues.  The deep development program remains on budget and on schedule, and shaft access and sinking continue according to plan.

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>The Company's 50% owned New Britannia mine is scheduled to commence production in the third quarter of 1995. As the operator of the project, the Company has been successful in maintaining the construction and development of the project on budget and on schedule. The headframe has been erected and the foundation for the mill has been poured. It is expected that the mill will be in place by the end of the second quarter. Shaft sinking from the previous 600 metre level to the 1,000 metre level continues on schedule. Once operational, the mine is expected to produce 100,000 ounces of gold on annual basis.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>The Company remains confident that a positive production decision will be made in early 1996 at its 32% owned Musselwhite project. Drilling results at the project continue to exceed expectations and completion of the feasibility study is expected by year end.  Total proven and probable reserves are currently estimated to be 11 million tonnes averaging 9 grams of gold per tonne, at a cut-off grade of 4.5 grams per tonne, and containing 3.2 million (TVX share 1 million) ounces of gold.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>The Company's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project is anticipated to have one million ounces of reserves by the end of 1995. The Company increased its interest in the project to 100% during the first quarter of 1995.  An accelerated $3 million drilling program commenced in the first quarter. Initial results support the continued presence of sulfide systems with some veins being traced for over 200 metres in length. Drifting continues at a rate of 8 metres per day.   The 1995 program call for 500 metres of expansion on the existing 1,500 metres of development.

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>The Company has an $8 million exploration program in place for 1995 at its 92% owned Pachicutza project in Ecuador. The exploration consists of 20,000 metres of drilling and about 3,000 metres of underground drifting.  The completion of an 18 kilometre road has facilitated  access to 60 kilometres of trails and allowed for the erection of seven temporary exploration camps, and a sample preparation facility. As of the end of the first quarter, 15 square kilometres of the concession were geologically mapped, 8 kilometres of trenching completed, and over 8,000 metres of core drilling sampled. Initial indicated resource calculations are anticipated by mid-1995.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>NEW PROJECT</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>The Company was named the winning bidder for the Kassandra Mines in the latter part of the first quarter. The company proposes to purchase the Kassandra Mines assets for approximately $47 million. The purchase price will be payable as $19 million on closing with five equal installments, plus interest, on the anniversary dates of the closing. It is anticipated that the purchase will close in the second quarter of 1995. Company personnel continue to gear their efforts to allow for an orderly succession of operations. Plans are in place to commence  environmental rehabilitation, the employment and retraining of  miners, and the enhancement and modernization of the existing operations, upon the closing. The construction of an autoclave plant will be tendered to experienced engineering firms on a turn key basis. Upon completion of the autoclave plant and the subsequent start of commercial production, the anticipated annual production of the Kassandra Mines is estimated at 350,000 gold equivalent ounces for the initial three years of full production.  Thereafter gold equivalent production for the 20 year life of the project will be approximately 200,000 ounces per annum.   

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Cash flow from operations increased to $2.2 million in the first quarter of 1995, from $1.5 million in the comparable 1994 period, as a result of the increase in earnings described above.  Expenditures on mining properties, plant and equipment were $35.1 million in 1995 (1994 - $4.2 million) as the Company's development and expansion plans progress.  Major expenditures in 1995 include the acquisition of an additional 10% interest in the Braslia mine for $14 million, construction of the New Britannia mine for $3.1 million and development and expansion of the Mineral Hill mine ($2.1 million) and the Casa Berardi mine ($2.8 million).  The Company's net cash position remained strong at $81 million at the end of the first quarter (1994 - $144 million).<BR>

	<P>TVX is the kind of long-term growth and secure investment folks should consider, especially in light of a pricy overall stock market, the defensive qualities of gold mining stocks, and the long-term price demand/supply balance favoring eventual higher gold prices. Ditto on the user-friendly website!

	<P>Great site! I know that you will still use canadian corporate news for releases 
but, I wish that you would also consider "Canadian News Wire" I will use your site when I have time but it is really convenient to scan the news wire during a busy day. Would you also send me information on your percent stake in the " Mussel White Project"

</PRE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Net Earnings</FONT></B>

<P>Net earnings in 1995 totaled $9.4 million, a decrease of 59% over the $22.8 million realized in 1994, which was a 45% increase over the $15.7 million recorded in 1993. Net earnings per share were $0.06, which compares with $0.14 in 1994 and $0.12 in 1993. 
	
<P>The significant decrease in 1995 earnings from 1994 is principally related to lower foreign exchange gains due to the stabilization of the Brazilian currency, higher exploration spending and higher operating costs encountered at the Casa Berardi and Braslia mines. These reductions in earnings were partially offset by the gains realized on the settlement of the Brisas property dispute and lower income taxes.
	
<P>The increase in net earnings in 1994 over 1993 is attributed to higher interest income due to the issuance of $146.5 million common shares in January 1994, higher foreign exchange gains realized in Brazil and lower interest expense due to reduction in the La Coipa project financing. These improvements were offset by lower operating margins at the Novo Astro and La Coipa mines and a three fold increase in exploration spending.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Reserves</FONT></B>

<P>The Companys share of proven and probable ore reserves, a key component of future production growth potential, at December 31, 1995 increased by 69% to 13.7 million gold equivalent ounces compared to 8.1 million ounces at December 31, 1994. This increase is due to acquisitions undertaken during 1995, particularly the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. Through the development of these projects, the Company anticipates attaining one million ounces of annual gold production by the turn of the century.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/ppreserves.gif" WIDTH=195 HEIGHT=80 ALT="Proven & Probable Reserves (Ozs millions)">

<P>Key activities which occurred during 1995 are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>on March 3, 1995, the Company was named the successful bidder for the Kassandra Mines Complex in Greece. On December 21, 1995, the contract was signed and the Company acquired the assets for approximately $46 million with the initial payment of $19 million and the remainder payable over a 5 year period, plus interest. The Company has a commitment to complete the construction of a gold plant within two years from the receipt of all necessary licences and maintenance of certain staffing levels for a period of three years. Refer to note 13(c) in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Companys commitments.

<P><LI>in January 1995, the Company acquired an additional 10.3% interest in the Braslia mine for $14 million, bringing the Companys effective ownership to 33%. This acquisition represents an additional 16,000 ounces of annual gold production  to the Company.

<P><LI>the Company completed and put into production the New Britannia mine for a total capital cost of  $38 million. Underground production for the main mine should reach capacity in the second quarter of 1996, as the operation is currently mining a satellite ore zone.

<P><LI>the Company acquired a 50% interest in two undeveloped gold properties in the Kamchatka peninsula of Eastern Russia. These properties contain approximately 2 million ounces of gold. The Company has the option to acquire, pending the issuance of certain licences, an additional 50% interest in these properties.
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Mine Operations</FONT></B>

<P>A description of the Companys operations is contained on pages 18 to 43 of this report. The description contains details on financial information, unit costs, operating statistics, reserves and operating performance.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Revenue</FONT></B>

<P>Revenue from 413,100 ounces of gold equivalent sold during the year was $156.9 million, consistent with the $157.2 million from sales of 422,900 ounces reported in 1994 which was 4% lower than the $163.4 million from sales of 440,300 ounces in 1993.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/revenue.gif" WIDTH=202 HEIGHT=80 ALT="Revenue ($US millions)">

<P>Realized revenue on an equivalent ounce basis was $380 in 1995 and $371 in 1994 and 1993, compared to COMEX averages of $384, $384 and $360 respectively.

<P>The consistent revenues between 1995 and 1994 were the combined result of lower ounces sold, due to reduced sales from Casa Berardi and Novo Astro mines, which was offset by the increased ownership in Braslia and higher realized prices due to the reduced impact of hedging transactions. The decrease between 1994 and 1993 was the result of an increase in dor inventories.

<P>The Companys realization per ounce sold differs from the COMEX average primarily as a result of hedging programs. Hedging programs, which are primarily entered into to minimize the downside risk of metal price fluctuations, reduced revenues by $1.7 million in 1995 and $4.2 million in 1994 and contributed revenues of $2.7 million in 1993. Brazilian price premiums did not contribute to higher revenues in 1995 or 1994, but contributed $2.2 million in 1993.

<P>In 1995, gold equivalent realizations per gold equivalent ounce were $4 below the COMEX average due to the positive impact of gold hedging offsetting silver hedging losses at the La Coipa mine. Please refer to notes 7 and 9 in the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the Companys gold and silver hedging positions as at December 31, 1995. 

<P>During 1994, gold equivalent realizations per gold equivalent ounce were $13 below the COMEX average and were primarily due to silver hedging conducted by one of the Companys joint venture partners.

<P>The Company has a hedging policy which allows management to hedge up to a maximum of 60% of the next five years of production. The purpose of hedging a portion of the Companys production is to ensure its revenue stream. The Company uses forward sales, spot deferred sales, the sale of call options and the purchase of put options to hedge production from time to time. The Company constantly reviews its hedging position, and changes in the price of gold and silver, interest rates and contangos could cause the Company to change its position on hedging. 

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Mine Operating Costs</FONT></B>

<P><B>Cost of sales</B><BR>
For purposes of financial reporting, the Company defines cost of sales as operating costs, marketing, refining and changes in inventory levels, together with administration expenses at the joint venture level directly attributable to mining activities. The Companys cash costs in both total dollars and per equivalent ounce measures, are dependent on the amount of production contributed by each mine 
during the year.

<P>In 1995, cash costs totaled $90.7 million compared to $84.3 million in 1994 and $75.6 million in 1993. On a gold equivalent ounce sold basis, cash costs were $219 in 1995, up from $199 in 1994 and $172 in 1993.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/cashcost.gif" WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=82 ALT="Cash cost per ounce ($US/Oz)">

<P>The La Coipa mine, which accounts for 38% of the Companys cost of sales in 1995, decreased to $168 per gold equivalent ounce sold in 1995 compared to $171 in 1994, due to higher production volume.

<P>The Crixs and Braslia mines cash costs increased to $177 and $235 per gold equivalent ounce sold in 1995 compared to $170 and $196 respectively in 1994. The impact of the strengthening of the Brazilian currency has resulted in increased local operating costs when converted into U.S. dollar terms, while efficiencies at Crixs helped to reduce its overall impact.

<P>The Casa Berardi mine cash costs increased to $449 per gold equivalent ounce sold from $227 in 1994. Higher unit operating costs were the result of increased operating development, lower grades and tonnage and a writedown in the circuit inventory. Total production for the property dropped by 39% in 1995, but production returned to normal levels in the fourth quarter of 1995 and the Company anticipates a significant reduction in unit costs in 1996.

<P>The Mineral Hill mine cash costs increased to  $359 per gold equivalent ounce sold from $321 in 1994. The mine results will continue to be impacted by limited ore headings until the Crevice Mountain project comes on stream in mid 1997. An additional ore zone (Ski Slope) has been identified and will supplement 1996 gold production. As a result, cash costs should be reduced marginally in 1996.

<P>The Novo Astro mine, which ceased production in mid-1995, had cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold of $183 in 1995, compared to $238 in 1994. 

<P>The Company anticipates a reduction in its overall unit cash costs in 1996, primarily as a result of increased gold production at the Casa Berardi mine as tonnage resumes to expected levels, also due to efficiencies to be realized at Braslia with the use of larger equipment  and increases in overall mill throughput at Braslia  and Crixs.

<P>The increase in cash costs to $199 in 1994 from $172 in 1993, was principally the result of mining lower grades at La Coipa in 1994 whereas in 1993, the operation mined higher grade material in order to generate sufficient cash flow to meet a $75 million project debt repayment. Other contributing factors were tailings dam repairs at the Crixs mine and the mining of lower grades at Casa Berardi, Mineral Hill and Braslia.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Depletion and Depreciation</FONT></B>

<P>The Companys depletion and depreciation expenses, in both total dollars and per gold equivalent ounce measures, are dependent on the amount of production, capital costs and gold reserve base for each mine. All mines are different and therefore the depletion and depreciation expense is a composite amount.

<P>Depletion and depreciation expenses decreased to $37.6 million in 1995 from $41.6 million in 1994 and $45.9 million in 1993. On a per gold ounce equivalent basis they were $91 in 1995, $98 in 1994 and $104 in 1993.

<P>The decrease in depletion and depreciation expenses by 10% in 1995 compared to 1994 was primarily due to the completion of mining at Novo Astro, which had a relatively high depletion charge, and reduced charges at Casa Berardi, due to lower production levels.

<P>The decrease in depletion and depreciation by 9% in 1994 compared with 1993 was primarily due to lower gold equivalent sales at the La Coipa mine, which has a relatively high depletion and depreciation charge.

<P>The Company anticipates depletion and depreciation rates in 1996 of $90 per ounce, despite the fact that gold reserves have increased substantially. This is due to the fact that the increases in reserves are primarily related to new projects which will not be in production in 1996.

Corporate administration increased to $10.1 million in 1995 compared to $7.5 million in 1994 and  $6.6 million in 1993 which represents, on a per gold equivalent ounce basis, $24, $18 and $15 respectively. The increase in 1995 is the result of the Companys increasing international focus, management of near term expansion in gold production and the costs associated with the closure of an office and severance 
of employees.

<P>The increase in 1994 from 1993 was principally the result of the addition of personnel due to the growth in the Companys operations as well as costs related to the acquiring of a listing of the Companys shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

<P>The Company anticipates corporate administration costs of $9 million in 1996.

<P><B>Interest Expense</B><BR>
Interest expense was $7.2 million in 1995 compared to $7.4 million in 1994 and $13.9 million in 1993. Interest expense remained consistent in 1995 with 1994 as increases in debt financing in the latter part of the year were offset by scheduled debt repayments. The 1994 decrease over 1993 was due to significant debt repayments at the La Coipa, Novo Astro and Crixs mines.

<P>Interest expense is expected to increase in 1996 due to the issuance of the $150 million Unsecured Notes offering in January, 1996. The project financing at La Coipa is expected to be repaid in full in 1996.

<P><B>Exploration and Business Development</B><BR>
The Companys strategy is to grow through the expansion of reserves and production at existing mines and through the acquisition, exploration  and development of new properties. The Company participates in minimal grass roots exploration preferring to focus on advanced stage projects. Exploration spending, exclusive of property acquisition costs, amounted to $19.0 million in 1995 compared to $15.6 million and $5.1 million in 1994 and 1993.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/expbusdev.gif" WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=89 ALT="Exploration and Business Development ($US millions)">

<P>Exploration and business development continue to increase as the Company maintains its aggressive growth strategy, with expenditures increasing by 21% over 1994, as compared to a three-fold increase between 1994 and 1993. The most significant expenditures made in 1995 were for the Pachicutza project in Ecuador, expansion of reserves around the Mineral Hill mine in Montana, and various properties in Brazil and Peru. The Company completed its commitment for the technology of treatment of refractory ores in 1995 and decided not to proceed further. A description of the Companys exploration and development projects is contained on pages 44 to 58 of this report.

<P>The increase in expenditures in 1994 versus 1993 relates primarily to expenditures at the Pachicutza project, Mineral Hill and Crixs mines and refractory ore research.

<P>The Companys policy is to expense exploration and development expenditures until it has been established that a mineral property has development potential. When this has been established, further costs prior to the commencement of mining are capitalized. All property acquisition costs are capitalized and expensed only when properties are abandoned. During 1995, the Company determined that three projects had development potential; the Pachicutza property in Ecuador, the Asacha property in eastern Russia and the Ski Slope deposit at Mineral Hill. In 1994, five projects met this criterion; New Britannia, Musselwhite, the Casa Berardi deep development program, the Crevice Mountain project at Mineral Hill and the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic.

<P>The Company will continue its aggressive exploration program in 1996, with costs expected to be approximately $10 million.

<P><B>Translation and Foreign Exchange</B><BR>
The impact of foreign exchange returned to normal levels in 1995 as compared to 1994. In 1994, the Company realized significant favourable foreign exchange gains as a result of dramatic changes to the Brazilian monetary system. The Company does not anticipate significant fluctuations in foreign exchange during 1996. 

<P><B>Interest Income</B><BR>
The Companys policy is to invest its surplus cash in liquid, short-term investments. In 1995, the Companys interest income was $15.8 million versus $18.8 million in 1994 and $2.3 million in 1993. Interest income remained high in 1995, despite decreasing cash balances, due to higher returns received on short-term Brazilian investments. The increase in 1994 compared to 1993, was due to higher cash balances as a result of the equity offering in January 1994.

<P>The Company anticipates interest income to rise in 1996 due to the $150 million Unsecured Note issuance, which occurred in January 1996.

<P><B>Other Income/Loss</B><BR>
Other income increased to $2.8 million from a loss of  $0.4 million in 1994 and a gain of $1.7 million in 1993. This increase is principally related to the $7.5 million gain on the settlement of the Brisas property dispute in Venezuela, which has been offset by charges related to asset disposals and a writedown for marketable securities of $2.1 million.  

<P>In the first quarter of 1996, the Company has disposed of all of its shares in Gold Reserve received as a result of the Brisas property settlement and other publicly traded companies, which resulted in an additional after-tax profit of approximately $6 million.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Income and Mining Taxes</FONT></B>

<P>Effective tax rates on earnings before income and mining taxes were 0% in 1995, 26% in 1994 and 29% in 1993. The effective tax rate is a composite rate resulting from the various tax regimes in which the Company operates. 

<P>The significant drop in the effective tax rate in 1995 from 1994 and 1993, is primarily related to lower rates in the Companys foreign jurisdictions and due to non taxable gains realized in foreign subsidiaries.

<P>In Brazil, effective January 1, 1996, combined corporate and social tax rates were reduced to 33% from 53%. Also, the effects of inflation are no longer recognized for tax purposes. These impacts will reduce the Companys future tax expenses.

<P>The Company expects its long-term effective tax rate to average 30%.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Cash Flow and Liquidity</FONT></B>

<P><B>Cash Flow from Operating Activities</B><BR>
Cash provided from operating activities totaled $40.7 million in 1995, $56.6 million in 1994 and $52.9 million in 1993. The decrease in the 1995 cash flow from 1994 is attributed to higher cash operating costs, higher exploration spending and reductions in realized foreign exchange gains. Working capital of the Company was $43.5 million at December 31, 1995, compared to $31.0 million and $19.2 million in 1994 and 1993.

<P>The increase in working capital in 1995 is primarily attributed to minority investments in publicly traded companies which have been predominately sold subsequent to the year end. Receipt of the $4.5 million in escrow funds on the 1994 settlement of the Brisas property is expected to be received in the second quarter of 1996.

<P>The increase between 1994 and 1993 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable related to cash expenditures made on the Brisas property dispute in Venezuela, advances made on behalf of the Companys joint venture partner for the development of the New Britannia mine and increases in inventory.

<P><B>Investing Activities</B><BR>
Investments in mining property, plant and equipment were $126.5 million in 1995 compared to $51.7 million in 1994 and $14.2 million in 1993. The continued increase in investments in 1995 and 1994 was primarily due to acquisition of producing and development properties and the continued growth of current operations.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/minecapital.gif" WIDTH=201 HEIGHT=79 ALT="Mine Capital ($US millions)">

<P>The following significant investments were made in 1995:

<P><B>Existing Operations</B>
<UL>
<LI>Braslia, Brazil  acquisition of an additional 10.3% interest in the Braslia mine for $14.0 million. Also, 
$4 million was spent as a result of a decision in the second half of the year to replace the mining contractor and perform mining in-house, with larger, more efficient 85 tonne trucks. This should result in a 45% reduction in mining costs.
<P><LI>New Britannia, Canada  completion of the development and production start-up in the fourth quarter of the New Britannia mine with 1995 capital costs of $12.5 million to the Company.
<P><LI>Casa Berardi, Canada  continued spending on the construction of a shaft and deep development program, with 1995 capital costs of $15.0 million to the Company.
<P><LI>La Coipa, Chile  spending related to the stripping of the existing Ladera-Farellon pit as well as the adjacent Coipa Norte pit. The Companys share of total costs were $6.5 million in 1995.
<P><LI>Mineral Hill, United States  continued spending on the Crevice Mountain tunnel and development of the newly discovered Ski Slope zone, with spending of $8.7 million in 1995.
<P><LI>Kassandra Mines, Greece  feasibility study, metallurgical tests and acquisition costs of 
$55.2 million. Of this amount, $27.2 million is payable to the vendor in five equal installments of 
$5.5 million over the next five years, plus interest.
<P><LI>the purchase and dismantling of two mills, for a total expenditure of $12.8 million. One of these mills will be used for the Pachicutza property in Ecuador.
</UL>

<P><B>Development Projects</B>
<UL>
<LI>Kamchatka, Russia  acquisition costs of exploration properties in Eastern Russia for a total expenditure of $5.3 million in 1995.
<P><LI>Kasperske Hory, Czech Republic  costs related to the expansion of underground reserves of $5.4 million.
<P><LI>Musselwhite, Canada  exploration and feasibility study costs of $4.6 million which resulted in a positive production decision in early 1996.
</UL>

<P>Spending on other assets increased to $20.6 million, principally as a result of the valuation of the shares received on the Brisas property dispute and the acquisition of minority equity positions in publicly traded companies.

<P>Also during 1995, the Company sold its 31% indirect interest in the Novo Astro mine in northern Brazil, for net proceeds of $9.9 million, which approximated its residual value.

<P>The increase in capital expenditures to $51.7 million in 1994 from $14.2 million in 1993 was primarily due to the acquisition of 90.5% of the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic, spending on the Casa Berardi deep development project, initial development of the New Britannia gold mine and acquisition of the Chimberos silver deposit located near the La Coipa mine.

<P>Expenditures in 1996 are estimated to be $35 million for existing operations and $160 million for development projects. Actual 1996 expenditures will be impacted the most by the progress of the Kassandra and Musselwhite projects.

<P><B>Financing Activities</B><BR>
Net long-term debt repayments were $14.5 million in 1995, $26.3 million in 1994 and $38.7 million in 1993. 

<P>The principal debt repayments relate to the project financing for the La Coipa mine in 1995, 1994 and 1993 of $31.2 million (including an unscheduled prepayment of $12.5 million in December 1995), $18.8 million and $37.5 million respectively. This loan is expected to be fully paid in 1996. An additional 
$8.5 million was repaid on the Companys silver loan.

<P>Additional debt financing of $13.8 million was received in 1995 from the completion of the New Britannia mine financing. This recourse debt financing can become non-recourse in 1996, once certain commercial completion tests are reached. Additionally, export financing loans of $15.4 million were received in Brazil by both operating mines, which carry favourable local interest rates. These loans, while short-term in nature, are expected to be utilized as a form of revolving credit facility.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Liquidity</FONT></B>

<P>The Companys net cash position for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $13.9 million, $122.2 million and $2.5 million respectively. Net cash consists of cash and cash equivalents less bank indebtedness. The Company considers cash equivalents to include financial instruments with maturities of less than ninety days. In January, 1996, the Company issued US$150 million of 7.5% Unsecured Notes which are due January, 2001, to strengthen its cash position.

<P>On January 6, 1994, the Company issued 23 million common shares of Cdn$8.75 per share, resulting in net proceeds of Cdn$193.3 million.

<P>The total current and long-term debt balance of the Company at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $92.0 million, $80.6 million and $106.8 million respectively. In 1996, improved current operations cash flows, sales of investments held in publicly traded companies and financing from the Unsecured Notes issue should provide sufficient cashflow to meet the capital requirements of the Company. Further commitments on the Kassandra Mines assets will require additional funding in 1997, and it is anticipated this will be provided through project financing.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Environmental</FONT></B>

<P>The Companys environmental programs are designed to minimize the environmental impact of its operations and should significantly reduce future restoration costs.

<P>Environmental costs are accrued over the life of each mine, once a reasonable estimate of the closure costs can be determined. The Company charged $0.8 million in 1995 and 1994, to cost of sales related to post closure accruals and environmental costs. Additionally,  $2.7 million and $1.1 million were spent in 1995 and 1994 on environmental capital projects, with the increase in 1995 related to the construction of the 
New Britannia tailings area and expansion of the existing Casa Berardi tailings area.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Risks</FONT></B>

<P>The Company operates in the precious metals mining industry and is inherently exposed to operational, geographical and financial risks.

<P>Operational hazards which could interrupt or otherwise seriously impair future production include supply obstacles, physical asset damage or destruction, labour interruptions and stability, unexpected ground conditions and orebody structures. To reduce these hazards, the Company carefully plans and designs its mines, trains employees in safety and production methods and maintains adequate supply inventories and insurance.

<P>Geographic risks arise from political, legal, social, structural, and economic conditions. The Company has recently further diversified its investment base, thus reducing its dependance on any one sector. As well, there is a growing liberalization of mining laws globally, which will increase access to mining properties throughout the world. The Company obtains political risk insurance to further reduce country risk as required. Local management and advisors are employed where possible to monitor and assess economic, political and legal developments which could affect the Company and to allow a prompt response to any perceived threat. For instance, two lawsuits were launched against the Company in late 1995, with regards to the Companys acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets and its Russian properties. These claims are detailed in notes 13 a) and 13 b) of the financial statements. The Company firmly believes that these claims are unfounded and will aggressively defend against these matters.  

<P>Commodity pricing, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and income taxes are some of the financial threats to which the Company is exposed. Because the world markets for precious metals can be volatile, the Company hedges its precious metals production from time to time. The Company estimates that a $10 per ounce change in the price of gold in 1996 will affect net earnings by approximately $3 million. As the world foreign exchange markets can fluctuate, the Company hedges its foreign exchange exposure when deemed appropriate. Interest rate risks arise from unexpected changes in inflation combined with the level of debt financing utilized. To reduce this risk, the Company maintains an appropriate mix of debt and equity in order to allow access to both the debt and equity markets as required. When debt financing is required, the Company prefers to utilize non-recourse project financing, with a rapid repayment schedule, to further reduce commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.

			<P><B>The accompanying consolidated financial statements of TVX Gold Inc. and all the information in this annual report are the responsibility of management and have been approved by the Board of Directors.</B>

			<P>The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada. When alternative accounting methods exist, management has chosen those it deems most appropriate in the circumstances. Financial statements are not precise since they include certain amounts based on estimates and judgments. Management has determined such amounts on a reasonable basis in order to ensure that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects. Management has prepared the financial information presented elsewhere in the annual report and has ensured that it is consistent with that in the financial statements.

<P>TVX Gold Inc. maintains systems of internal accounting and administrative controls in order to provide, on a reasonable basis, assurance that the financial information is relevant, reliable and accurate and that the Companys assets are appropriately accounted for and adequately safeguarded.

<P>The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the financial statements. The Board carries out this responsibility principally through its Audit Committee.

<P>The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board, and all of its members are outside directors. The Committee meets at least three times a year with management, as well as the external auditors, to discuss internal controls over the financial reporting process, auditing matters and financial reporting issues, to satisfy itself that each party is properly discharging its responsibilities, and to review the annual report, the financial statements and the external auditors report. The Committee reports its findings to the Board for consideration when approving the financial statements for issuance to the shareholders. The Committee also considers, for review by the Board and approval by the shareholders, the engagement or reappointment of the external auditors.

<P>Financial statements have been audited by Price Waterhouse, the external auditors, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards on behalf of the shareholders. 
Price Waterhouse has full and free access to the Audit Committee.

		<A NAME= "Note1"></A><P><B>1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B><BR>
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in Canada which, in the Company's case, conform in all material respects with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, except as disclosed in note 16.
<P>The significant accounting policies followed by the Company and its incorporated and unincorporated
joint ventures are summarized as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>(a) Basis of consolidation</B><BR>
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Investments in incorporated and unincorporated joint ventures are accounted for by the proportionate
consolidation method as substantially all of the Company's business is conducted through joint
ventures. 

<P><B>(b) Translation of foreign currencies</B><BR>
The accounts of the Canadian operations and operations in foreign countries have been translated into
United States dollars using the temporal method because the Company considers the U.S. dollar to be
the principal currency of its operations. Under this method, monetary assets and liabilities have been
translated at the end of year exchange rates. Non-monetary assets, which primarily comprise
inventories and mining property, plant and equipment, have been translated using historic rates of
exchange. Revenues and expenses have been translated at the average rates of exchange during the
years, except for depletion and depreciation, which have been translated at the same rates as the related
assets.
<P>Foreign exchange gains and losses on current monetary assets and liabilities are included in the
determination of earnings. Gains and losses related to long-term debt are deferred and amortized over
the remaining term of the debt.

<P><B>(c) Inventories</B><BR>
Gold and silver bullion inventories are stated at market. Dor, work-in-process and ore stockpiles are
stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Materials and supplies inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or replacement value.

<P><B>(d) Mining property, plant and equipment</B><BR>
Mining property, plant and equipment is shown at cost including costs associated with acquisition and
further development of mining properties. Depletable assets are amortized over the life of the mine on
a unit-of-production basis. The estimated mine lives range from 6 to 20 years with the average being
17 years. Depreciable assets are also amortized over the life of the mine on a unit-of-production basis
except where the useful life of a depreciable asset is less than the life of the mine, in which case
depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis.

<P><B>(e) Exploration and business development</B><BR>
Exploration expenditures, excluding property acquisition costs, are charged to earnings as incurred. 
When it has been established that a mining property has development potential, further exploration
costs incurred prior to the start of mining operations, are recorded as deferred development costs and
amortized as development costs in accordance with the policies described above.

<P><B>(f) Reclamation costs</B><BR>
Expenditures relating to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged against
earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefit. 
These ongoing programs are designed to minimize the environmental impact of the Company's mining
operations and should significantly reduce future removal and site restoration costs that 
may otherwise be incurred upon cessation of mining activities. Estimated future reclamation costs,
including site restoration, where reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over the
estimated life of the mine.

<P><B>(g) Income and mining taxes</B><BR>
Deferred income and mining taxes are provided as a result of timing differences that arise in the
recognition of revenue and expenses in different years for accounting than for income and mining tax
reporting purposes. Taxes have been provided on undistributed earnings of non-Canadian operations
based upon the level of expected remittance of these earnings.

<P><B>(h) Financing costs</B><BR>
Debt issue costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt. Financing costs, including
interest and debt issue costs, are capitalized when they arise from indebtedness incurred to finance
development activities on properties that are not in full production and are amortized to earnings when
mining operations commence. 
 
<P><B>(i) Commitments to deliver gold and silver</B><BR>
Commitments to deliver gold and silver arise from gold and silver loans, fixed forward sales, spot
deferred sales and option contracts.
<P>Contracted prices on forward sales, spot deferred sales and options related to future production are
recognized in revenue as the related gold and silver is delivered.
<P>Gold and silver loans which hedge the Company's share of revenues from future production are
marked to the spot price at the balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses are deferred and are
reflected in earnings when the hedged production is delivered.

<P><B>(j) Cash and cash equivalents</B><BR> 
Cash and cash equivalents include those short-term money market instruments which, on acquisition,
generally have a term to maturity of three months or less.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME= "Note2"></A><P><B>2. Accounts Receivable</B><BR>
As a result of inflows of overburden material and caving of fault material in 1992, the Company has
recorded $4,966,000 as insurance claims receivable (December 31, 1994 - $4,920,000), representing
its share of costs incurred as a result of the incidents, excluding any business interruption costs, and net
of an interim payment of $1,238,000 received in 1993. The Company has filed insurance claims,
which include business interruption costs. As described in Note 15 (c), this claim has been settled.

  (1994 - 3,480,500) ounces of silver. This loan is repayable in three equal semi-annual installments
  from February 28, 1996 to February 28, 1997. Interest is at a rate of 2.5%. 
  The Company has pledged its residual interest in the La Coipa mine as collateral for this loan. The

  1995. The loan is secured by the assets of the joint venture and a first charge on the ownership
  interests of the joint venture participants in the New Britannia mine. The Company has guaranteed

  equal to the one year Greek State bond rate.

  <P><LI>The balance of the La Coipa project financing is repayable on June 30, 1996. Interest is at  a

<P>At December 31, 1995, the Company has open purchase contracts for 2.96 million ounces of silver at an average price of $5.93 per ounce (December 31, 1994  10 million ounces at $5.93 per ounce) 
2 million of which is to offset silver forwards and calls sold and puts purchased by the operator of the La Coipa mine. As at December 31, 1995 the Companys share of total silver forwards sold and in the money calls sold and puts purchased at the La Coipa mine was 2.4 million ounces at a weighted average price of $5.33 per ounce of silver (December 31, 1994  6,625,000 ounces at $5.07 per ounce). At December 31, 1995, as a result of these transactions, the Company has realized and unrealized losses amounting to $0.31 per ounce (December 31, 1994  $0.23 per ounce realized revenue), which will be charged to income when the balance of the 10 million ounces is delivered by La Coipa.

<P>To close these transactions as at December 31, 1995 would generate a gain of approximately 
$4.2 million. The counter parties to these contracts are international banks, none of which holds 
greater than 36% of the aggregate hedged position.

<LI><B>Kassandra Litigation</B><BR>							
	A claim was filed against the Company on November 15, 1995, and subsequently amended, relating to the Companys interest in the Kassandra mining assets in Greece. The plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duties and misuse of confidential information and seek, among other things: 	
	(i) a declaration that the Company holds the Kassandra orebodies in trust for the plaintiffs; or \
	(ii) acknowledgement that the Company holds a 12% carried interest in Kassandra in trust for the plaintiffs and a further 12% right to purchase in Kassandra; and (iii) damages in the amount of $500 million (Cdn.); and punitive damages in the amount of $1 million (Cdn.).

	<P>The Company is in the process of filing its statement of defence and while the outcome is not presently determinable, the Company firmly believes that the claims made by the plaintiffs are unfounded. The Company will aggressively defend this matter.

<P><LI><B>Kamchatka Litigation</B><BR>
	A Complaint Seeking Damages and Demand for Jury Trial with Injunctive Relief Sought was filed in the United States District Court against the Company on October 19, 1995 relating to their mining interests in Kamchatka, Russia. The plaintiffs allege that the Company breached the terms of a confidentiality agreement and claim, among other things: (i) judgment against the Company for breach of contract; (ii) a mandatory injunction to cease and desist from using the plaintiffs information and to stop all exploration, negotiation or purchasing of mining rights in Kamchatka; and (iii) the deposit in court of all sums collected by the Company as a result of mining and exploration of the subject sites.

	<P>The Company has filed an Answer, Affirmative Defences and Counterclaim on February 2, 1996 and while the outcome is not presently determinable, the Company firmly believes the claims made by the plaintiffs are unfounded. The Company will aggressively defend this matter.

<P><LI><B>Kassandra Mines Commitments</B><BR>
	Pursuant to the acquisition of the Kassandra Mine assets, signed on December 21, 1995, the Company is obligated to fulfil the following; <I>Purchase Price Mortgage:</I> To provide the vendor with a mortgage of approximately $36.0 million as security for unpaid purchase price amounts plus interest. The payment terms of the acquisition require 5 equal installments, on December 21 of each year, for approximately $5.5 million, plus applicable interest; <I>Gold Plant Guarantee:</I> The Company is obligated to construct a gold plant within two years from receiving all applicable licences, which may be extended by a further eight months under certain circumstances. The Company has provided a letter of guarantee of approximately $11.0 million against this commitment; <I>Employment Guarantee:</I> The Company is obligated to maintain 550 employees and a further 50 employees once the gold plant is completed, for a minimum period of three years. The Greek government is obligated to provide an allowance of 50% of the cost to employ 50 of these employees for a six month period and an additional 50 employees for a three year period. Additionally, employment must be offered by the contractor to 150 former employees of Kassandra for a period of 18 months, during the construction of the gold plant.

<P><LI><B>Kasperske Hory Commitment</B><BR> 
	Pursuant to an agreement dated August 8, 1994, as amended, the Company is obligated to issue to each of Royalstar Resources Ltd. (Royalstar) and Paramount Ventures and Finance Inc. (Paramount), 400,000 common shares of the Company if, within two years of the agreement date, the Company concludes that the Kasperske Hory property can be brought into commercial production. If the above two year period expires without the Company issuing the shares or the Company notifies the companies that the Kasperske Hory property does not contain an orebody which the Company wishes to bring into commercial production, Royalstar and Paramount have the right to repurchase their respective shares held by the Company at their original cost to the Company, plus an amount equal to 50% of the total cost incurred by the Company. As described in note 15 (b), the commitment to Royalstar has been settled.

On January 25, 1995, the Company purchased an additional 10.3% in the Braslia mine for $14.0 million from a company in which the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer held an 80% ownership interest. The purchase price was based on the future discounted cash flows of the operation. An equivalent offer was made simultaneously to another third party interest in the mine, which was rejected.

<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>On January 12, 1996, the Company issued $150.0 million of 7.51% Unsecured Notes due January 17, 2001. Commissions on the Notes totalled 0.9% or $1.4 million.

<P><LI>On February 20, 1996, the Company and Royalstar finalized an agreement whereby, in consideration for a payment of $1.5 million, Royalstar waived all its rights, as detailed in note 13 (d).

<P><LI>During the first quarter of 1996, the insurance claim for the Casa Berardi inflows was finalized for a total of $10.3 million, less an original advance of $2.0 million. The Companys 60% share of this settlement approximates the book value of the accounts receivable. Funds are expected to be received by the second quarter of 1996.

<P><LI>During the first quarter of 1996, the Company sold its equity position in Gold Reserve Corp., 1,500,000 common shares and 500,000 share purchase warrants, for total proceeds of approximately $14.0 million. As a result, the Company will realize an after tax gain of approximately $5.9 million.

<A NAME= "Note16"></A><P><B>16. Differences Between Canadian and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</B><BR>

	The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada (Canadian GAAP). In the Companys case United States generally accepted accounting principles, (U.S. GAAP), differ materially from Canadian GAAP in the accounting for income taxes.

	<P>The Company adopted SFAS 109 in 1993 for purposes of U.S. GAAP. SFAS 109 requires that the deferred taxes be provided for differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability, and the amounts reported in an entitys financial statements.

	<P>As a result of SFAS 109, both mining property, plant and equipment and deferred income taxes in the balance sheet would be increased by $29,725,000 at December 31, 1995, (December 31, 1994  $21,565,000). In the statement of earnings, depreciation and depletion would be increased by $1,256,000, (1994  $1,633,000; 1993  $961,000), and income and mining taxes decreased by the same amount. This difference does not impact overall net earnings.

	<P>As well, SFAS 109 requires that the annual adjustment of deferred tax balances to reflect current tax rates. Under Canadian GAAP, deferred tax balances are maintained at the tax rate in effect in which the year they were first reported. The principal mines in which the Company has interests, commenced operations in recent years therefore deferred taxes have been provided for at rates which have not changed significantly to date. As a result, deferred taxes under SFAS 109 are not materially different from deferred taxes reported in the Companys financial statements.

<h3>Histrico e Objetivos</h3>
<p><DD>O GEPEA foi constitudo em 1992, por um grupo de professores e alunos de ps-graduao do Departamento de Engenharia de Energia e Automao Eltricas (PEA) da Escola Politcnica da USP, envolvidos em pesquisa nas reas de energia e meio ambiente. 
<BR><DD>O intuito do GEPEA  desenvolver e incentivar o uso de tcnicas para a aplicao da energia eltrica de forma consistente com os conceitos de desenvolvimento sustentado.
<BR><DD>O grupo prioriza o desenvolvimento de pesquisas sobre o uso eficiente da energia eltrica, a gerao descentralizada usando fontes renovveis de energia eltrica, a eletrificao rural, a co-gerao e os aspectos institucionais e scio-ambientais relacionados com a energia eltrica, enfim o planejamento integrado de recursos.
<BR><DD>Neste contexto, o grupo apresenta carter multidisciplinar, devendo atuar no cenrio global das diversas formas de energia e suas relaes scio-econmicas e ambientais.

Definitely. Research is a valuable management
 tool. To manage water properly, we rely on 
a scientifically sound knowledge base. The
 Federal Water Policy states that "scientific

Neste contexto, um conhecimento apropriado do Estado da Arte de reas especficas da energia eltrica  de grande importncia para que se possa perseguir o equilbrio desejado usando as melhores tcnicas disponveis. A nfase nos aspectos multidisciplinares de projetos de eletricidade  tambm fundamental, para que se possa entender o processo como um todo, conviver com outras razes e criar as condies de sustentabilidade.<p>
Uma avaliao aberta da energia eltrica neste contesto mais amplo, desde a gerao at os usos finais - passando por temas como eficincia energtica, conservao de energia, qualidade da energia, automao e digitalizao - e a integrao dos mesmos ao meio ambiente,  fundamental para um possicionamento correto em relao aos desafios presentes e futuros, do desenvolvimento humano.<p>
Com a preocupao de criar um frum anual para discusso e acompanhamento destes assuntos, o GEPEA idealizou este encontro, que nesta primeira verso, constar de cursos de interesse, ministrados por professores com vasta experincia em suas reas. E est contando com o interesse e colaborao de professores de outras instituies de renome na rea, visando formar uma rede para troca de experincias e informaes, em um contexto aberto e democrtico de parcerias, extremamente necessrio no mundo atual, quanto mais no Brasil, com sua grande rea e heterogeneidade e diversidade. Assim, esto cooperando com o evento, professores da UNB: Universidade Nacional de Braslia, EFEI: Escola Federal de Engenharia de Itajub, UNICAMP: Universsidade de Campinas, IEE: Instituto de Eletrotcnica e Energia - USP, UFU: Universidade Federal de Uberlndia, DME: Departamento Municipal de Eletricidade - Poos de Caldas (MG), SEIVA - Consultoria e Projetos Ambientais e ECOLUZ Consusltores Associados ,criando uma semente que, espera-se, ir frutificar ao longo do tempo.<p>
<P>
Sua presena em Poos de Caldas ser de maior importncia para fortalecimento deste frum e formao de um grupo multidisciplinar de profissionais e estudantes preocupados e atuante nos sistemas energia, energia eltrica, meio ambiente e desenvolvimento sustentvel.<p><p>

Solar energy is so fundamental to the creation and sustenance of
life that there simply would be no life without the daily flows of
the sun to Earth. Without solar energy the Earth's temperature
would drop precipitously, becoming so cold and dark that the
                         conditions that nourish life and humanity would be
                         absent.

It has been estimated that 1,000 times more energy reaches the
earth's surface from the sun every single year than could be
produced by burning all the fossil fuels mined and extracted
during that same year. The U.S. receives more energy in the form of
                         sunlight in less than 40 minutes than it does from all the
                         fossil fuels it burns in a year.

Over the centuries, human ingenuity has devised many different
technologies for directly harnessing the sun's prodigious daily
stream of photons. Today, solar collectors can gather solar
thermal energy in almost any climate to provide a reliable,
                  cost-effective source of energy for many applications
                  including hot water for homes, residential heating, and hot
                  water for industries such as laundry and food processing.

Over 1.3 million homes in the U.S., for example, use solar panels
to collect the sun's direct and diffuse rays for home and water
heating. One-third of the buildings in Israel use solar water
heating, and all new homes are required to have solar water heating
                     systems. In the city of Tokyo, Japan, alone, there are nearly
                     1.5 million buildings with solar water heaters.

Solar water heating is one of the simplest ways to use the sun's
rays to save energy and money. Americans spend over $13 billion
per year for home water heating. The amount of energy used for
this task might best be understood by a simple analogy. A
                    medium-sized automobile driven 12,000 miles during the
                    year, at an average efficiency of 22 miles per gallon, will
                    use about 11.1 equivalent barrels of oil. Meanwhile, an
                    electric water heater supplying 80 gallons of hot water per
                    day (for an average family of four) will use 11.4 equivalent
                    barrels of oil each year. Solar hot water systems should be
able to provide 60 to 80 percent of this hot water service, saving money
and preventing pollution in the process.

In some of the sunniest locations, like the deserts of the U.S.
southwest, the direct sunlight reaches peak intensities of 1000
watts per square meter -- 30% more than average intensities.
These very sunny locations can be used by solar thermal electric
                           technologies to concentrate the sun's rays onto a small
                           area to permit the buildup of high-temperature heat,
                           which in turn can be converted into electricity in a
                           conventional heat engine.

Photovoltaic solar cell systems (PVs), which generate electricity
from sunlight, are one of the most exciting technologies ever
invented. They are quiet, give off no pollution, don't require
much land and water to operate, and can be used to generate both
                           electricity and fuels. PVs can be used to directly power
                           appliances and equipment. In the future, they can be
                           used for producing transport fuels like non-polluting
                           hydrogen, through a process known as electrolysis.

Many energy experts firmly believe that PVs could provide
much or most of humanity's energy needs within the century.
Historically, new energy sources and technologies have taken 50
to 100 years to become significant contributors, as oil did in
                               increasingly replacing wood, whale oil and coal more
                               than 100 years ago.

How much land area would it take to provide all of America's
electricity (2.9 trillion kWh in 1993) with PV power? Let's
assume 12% efficient solar cells, spaced so that half the land is
unused, in an average site in the U.S., like Missouri, where a square
                          meter of land would produce about 108 kWh of
                          electricity each year. This would require a land area of
                          26,000 square kilometers (10,000 square miles). For
                          comparison, 26,000 km^2 would be slightly larger than
                          the 25,000 km^2 of reservoir dams already being used
by Hydro Qubec in eastern Canada. The big difference, however, is
that the PVs would generate 1000 percent more electricity than
provided by these hydrodams.

From another perspective, 26,000 km^2 is the equivalent of
three-fourths of the Mojave desert in California. This is not to
suggest that the Mojave should be covered with PV panels, but
to illustrate how small a land area PV panels would occupy to provide
                                all U.S. power.

The biggest challenge now facing PVs is to bring down their
cost. Already, the cost of PVs have dropped an impressive
20-fold (2000%) since the 1970s. To deliver electricity from PV
systems currently costs about $6 to $8 per watt (W). A drop to $3/W
                              would expand the market 1000 percent or more, and
                              a drop to $1/W would make PV systems competitive
                              against most other energy sources. It is entirely
                              feasible that PV power could be a major source of the
                              world's electricity within the next 25 years.

There are more than 90 million residential buildings in the U.S.
and that number is expected to rise to 130 million by 2030.
There is also 60 billion square feet of commercial building space in the
U.S., which includes offices, educational institutions, retail and
                           wholesale businesses, restaurants and warehouses.
                           These buildings, and the hundreds of millions of
                           appliances and equipment devices in them, directly and

The gas and electric bills for U.S. buildings exceed $180 billion
per year. All the residential buildings, and a large percentage
of the commercial buildings, could take advantage of various passive
solar and energy efficiency improvements, which this building has
                             done. The opportunity exists to save half or more of
                             the yearly energy expense for buildings, and in so
                             doing, greatly reduce environmental pollution,
                             increase comfort, create a more attractive living
                             space, and increase the resale value of buildings.

Passive solar is a body of design strategies that focus on making
the site and building itself act as an energy-saving system. The
passive solar "features" of a building are its walls, roof, windows,
floors and foundation. They are used for controlling convection,
                       conduction and radiation so as to heat, cool, ventilate and
                       light the building as desired during the course of the day
                       and year. Landscaping is considered an extended part of
                       the building, where properly placed trees, bushes and
                       vines block unwanted solar radiation and/or cold winter
winds. A passive building often looks very much like its more
conventional next door neighbor, but it performs much better.
Well-crafted passive solar homes are less drafty, more comfortable,
and provide higher quality natural light.

Natural design strategies are simple, mainstream building
techniques that include: good envelope performance (well
insulated walls, foundation, roof, floors); correct orientation to the sun
(so that the longest sides face north and south); proper placement and
                   sizing of glazings (e.g., minimize the amount of north-facing
                   glass in cold climates, use a relatively large amount of
                   south-facing glass with shading devices, and adequately
                   shade and/or insulate glass on the east and west sides);
                   addition of thermal mass in the building envelope (such as
                   concrete, adobe, brick, water walls, for absorbing heat
during the day and slowly releasing it at night); and, incorporate one
or more passive solar systems (such as a direct gain system, thermal
storage wall or sunspace.

The amount of energy savings by using passive solar features,
the cost of achieving these savings, and the financial return on
the investment through reduced utility bills will vary by location. This
chart, prepared for the Passive Solar Heating and Cooling
                            Collaborative in California, shows the cumulative
                            reductions in utility bills from these measures. The
                            heating bill declines by three-fourths and the cooling
bill is entirely eliminated. The $1340 in annual utility savings provides
a nearly 40% return on the $3556 initial investment, which is superior
to most returns on stocks and bonds.

Passive solar buildings focus on providing space comfort
(heating and cooling) and high quality daylighting. Making the
building as energy efficient as possible is a key component of passive
solar construction. Many super-insulated buildings are able to greatly
reduce the need for mechanical heating or air conditioners.
Low-energy consuming appliances also add to savings and pollution
prevention.

Wind power is one of the most ancient energy resources
harnessed by humans that is also proving to be among the most
cost-effective ways of delivering electricity services in many parts
of the U.S. and in other countries around the world.

The U.S. wind industry believes wind power could provide
one-fifth of America's electricity over the next several decades at
prices competitive with less environmentally friendly energy
options. To achieve this goal will take a combination of ongoing
                   scientific and technological advancements in the design and
                   operation of wind turbines and supportive public policies
                   that allow wind turbines to compete on a level playing field
                   with fossil and nuclear resources. Already, wind is
                   providing several percent of some states' electricity services,
                   like in California. 
<DD>North America is very well endowed with wind resources. Twelve
states in the Great Plains contain about 90 percent of the nation's
usable wind resource. In order of greatest potential they are:
North Dakota, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska,
                                 Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado,and New
                                 Mexico. North Dakota alone has enough energy in
                                 its windy areas to supply one-third of the nation's
                                 current electricity, although it is unlikely that it will
                                 all be developed to produce wind power.

Even after imposing severe constraints on where wind turbines
can be sited (for example, avoiding urban areas, environmentally
sensitive lands and national parks) there is still sufficient wind
potential in the continental U.S. to produce more than 4.4 trillion kWh
of electricity each year. This is roughly 40% more than the 2.9 trillion
kWh of electricity consumed in the U.S. in 1993.
<DD>How much wind actually gets harnessed depends on a number of
factors. These include the price of alternative options, and the
speed with which institutions like states, utilities, and regulatory
bodies encourage the development of market incentives for the sale of
                                   wind generated power among states and regions.
                                   California, for example, is not ranked among the
                                   top 12 states with substantial wind resources, yet
                                   its vigorous support for wind power has resulted
in most of the world's wind power now located in California.

In addition to a dozen states with enormous wind resources,
several dozen other states have pockets of modest wind resources
that also offer economic opportunities for wind generation either
by individual homes and businesses, or by utilities and independent
                               power producers for distribution through the electric
                               grid. 
<DD>During the past 20 years, outstanding progress has been made in
the technology used to convert wind energy to electrical energy.
More than 16,000 wind turbines are operating in California,
which produced 3 billion kWh of electricity in 1994. This is enough
                  power to satisfy the residential needs of a city the size of San
                  Francisco (1 million people) or the total energy needs of a
                  city of 300,000 people (Buffalo, NY). In Europe, Denmark is
                  a world leader in wind power; the country has integrated
                  3,500 turbines into the utility grid.

Electricity from wind turbines has
dropped 20-fold over the past two decades, from $1 per kWh to 5
cents/kWh. It is expected to drop to 4 cents/kWh by the end of the
decade. A turbine's operating life has also improved, from lasting just
                               1 to 5 years in the mid-1970s to operating 20 years
                               today; by the turn of the century a 30 year lifespan
                               for turbines is expected. 
<DD>More than a dozen utilities and several independent power
producers have already announced plans to develop new wind
power plants before 2000. New wind facilities are planned for
Alaska, California, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana
                    New York, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and
                    Wyoming. Wind installations are also planned for several
                    locations in Canada, including Alberta and Quebec, as well
                    as in a number of remote villages throughout Mexico. 
<DD>Small wind turbine systems are often the most inexpensive source
of power for remote sites. Wind electric water pumping systems
are simple and rugged. Other common applications include
telecommunications and rural residences electrification. Remote power
                               systems using U.S. small wind turbines have been
                               installed in more than 70 countries around the world.
<DD>Remote wind power systems often incorporate additional
generating systems such as diesel generators and photovoltaic
solar arrays. These "hybrid" systems provide improved reliability
of power supply and operational flexibility. Only when the power from
                         the wind turbine is not sufficient to operate the load,
                         does the alternate power source come on-line. Hybrid
                         systems hold great promise for the billions of people
                         worldwide now living in villages remote from utility
                         grids.
<DD>Most modern wind turbines are used to produce electrical power
on site at homes, farms and businesses which are already served
by a utility grid. Because the average wind turbine generates
electricity less than 100 percent of the time, it may be important to be
                         connected to the electric utility grid in areas where winds
                         are seasonal or where energy storage systems are not
                         cost-effective. Usually, the electricity generated by the
                         wind turbine directly powers the home or business.
                         When wind-generated power is available, the user buys
less electricity from the utility. If the turbine generates more power
than the site is using, the utility buys the excess electricity, further
reducing the utility bill of the wind power producer.

Wind turbine systems are most promising as sources of
centralized electric power. Wind farms currently in existence in
the U.S. are rarely owned by public utility companies. Instead,
they are mainly owned by private businesses or individuals. The
                                   electricity produced by each of the power plants,
                                   which range in size from a few hundred kilowatts
                                   to tens of thousands, is then sold to the local
                                   electric utility.
<DD>In order to determine the best locations to site wind-power plants,
engineers undertake what is referred to as wind prospecting.
Wind-measuring instruments known as anenometers are set up
with recorders to take readings of wind speeds over a period of time (at
              least four months).
<DD>Wind power plants offer flexibility and modularity, allowing
utilities to install generating capacity as it is needed, with very
short lead times (in months or a few years, compared to 5 to 10
years for a large power plant). Wind power can also be used to support
                            new or growing electricity demand at the site of the
                            customer, preventing the need to upgrade transmission
                            and distribution lines.

The vision is staggering: a society powered almost entirely by hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe. In
this vision, renewable resources such as wind and solar energy are used to extract hydrogen from water. When the
hydrogen is used as an energy source, it generates no emissions other than water, which is recycled to make more
hydrogen. Making this vision a reality in the 21st century is the goal of researchers at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory.

<FONT SIZE=6>Hydrogen and Its Uses</FONT><BR>
Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless gas that accounts for 75 percent of the universe's mass. Hydrogen is found on Earth
only in combination with other elements such as oxygen, carbon and nitrogen. To use hydrogen, it must be separated
from these other elements.

<DD>Today, hydrogen is used primarily in ammonia manufacturing, petroleum refining and synthesis of methanol. It's also
used in NASA's space program as fuel for the space shuttles, and in fuel cells that provide heat, electricity and
drinking water for astronauts. Fuel cells are devices that directly convert hydrogen into electricity. In the future,
hydrogen could be used to fuel vehicles and aircraft, and provide power for our homes and offices.

<FONT SIZE=5>
As part of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Hydrogen Program, NREL conducts research on advanced
technologies to produce, store and safely use hydrogen made from renewable resources. The goal is to help industry
develop technologies to produce, store, transport and use hydrogen in quantities large enough, and at costs cheap
enough, to compete with traditional energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas.

<DD>NREL researchers are exploring using renewable resources such as sunlight, biomass and biological organisms to
produce hydrogen economically.

<DD>Photoconversion production-Researchers use either biological organisms (bacteria or algae) or semiconductors to
absorb sunlight, split water and produce hydrogen. Through their normal metabolic function, some biological
organisms naturally produce hydrogen; semiconductors produce hydrogen by generating an electric current that splits
water.

<DD>Thermochemical production-This approach uses heat to produce hydrogen from biomass and solid waste. An
NREL-developed pyrolysis technology uses heat to liquefy biomass. Steam is then used to make hydrogen from the
resulting bio-oil in a process known as steam reforming.

<FONT SIZE=6>Storage Research</FONT><BR>
Hydrogen is currently stored as a compressed gas or a cryogenic liquid in physical storage systems. NREL is
developing a solid-state storage system that is safer than physical storage systems, and could potentially store more
hydrogen per unit volume. Solid-state systems chemically or physically bind hydrogen to a solid material.

<DD>NREL's solid-state storage system uses microscopic carbon tubes to adsorb hydrogen. The technology can store high
volumes of hydrogen at higher temperatures than other technologies, and at near ambient pressure levels. The
hydrogen attaches to the surface of the carbon and is released by changing temperature and pressure levels.

<FONT SIZE=6>Hydrogen Sensors</FONT><BR>
Since hydrogen can neither be seen nor smelled, as an added safety precaution for hydrogen-fueled vehicles, NREL
researchers are developing a hydrogen leak detector. To detect hydrogen, a very thin sensor that reacts to hydrogen by
changing colors is applied to the end of a fiber optic cable. The sensors can be placed throughout the vehicle to relay
information on leak detection to a central control panel.

<FONT SIZE=6>Industry Interaction</FONT><BR>
Through working groups, NREL scientists interact with researchers from other national laboratories and industry to
exchange technical information and receive industry input on the direction of NREL's research program. These
working groups help NREL understand industry's needs, and help industry understand the technologies NREL is
developing.

<FONT SIZE=6>Benefits of Hydrogen</FONT><BR>
Hydrogen made from renewable energy resources is a virtually inexhaustible, environmentally benign energy source
that could meet most of our future energy needs. It's more versatile and has more uses than electricity. These uses
include providing energy for businesses, factories, electric utilities, homes, vehicles and airplanes. Hydrogen is also a
domestically produced energy source that could help reduce our reliance on foreign oil.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point2.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>
<FONT SIZE=6>Challenges</FONT><BR>
Researchers must overcome several obstacles if hydrogen is to become a major energy resource. Hydrogen is
currently more expensive than traditional energy sources; the production efficiency (the amount of energy or
feedstock used to produce hydrogen) must improve; and an infrastructure to efficiently transport and distribute
hydrogen must be developed. NREL's research is directed towards resolving these issues.



<DD>The first widespread use of hydrogen as an energy source is likely to be in the transportation sector, where it will help
reduce pollution. Internal combustion engines can be fueled with pure hydrogen, or hydrogen blended with natural
gas. Vehicles can also be powered with hydrogen fuel cells, which are three times more efficient than a
gasoline-powered engine. Fuel cells can also supply heat and electricity for homes and buildings.

<DD>The overall goal of DOE's Hydrogen Program is to replace 2 to 4 quads of conventional energy with hydrogen by the
year 2010, and replace 10 quads per year by 2030. A quad is the amount of energy consumed by 1 million
households.

WASHINGTON, DC - Unlike many other programs under scrutiny by the new Republican-run Congress, hydrogen
ener- gy research funding for once is actually ahead of the game - and ahead of what even some hydrogen supporters
had hoped for: The House-Senate conference, whose task it is to reconcile differing House and Senate versions of the
same bill, decided in late October to allocate $14.5 million for fiscal year 1996 to DoE's hydrogen energy program.
continued... 
<DD>     This was almost twice the budget estimate of $7.33 million, according to a budget chart published in the
     Oct. 26 issue of the "Congressional Record," and much closer to the $15 million voted earlier by the House
     and a far cry from the $9 million voted by the Senate. One veteran Capitol Hill watcher predicted then, the
     total probably wouldn't exceed $12 million (H&FCL, Sept. 95). (The chart did not list the current '95
     budget for the various categories).

<FONT SIZE=6>Newcomer Rep. Frank Riggs (R-CA) Plays Role </FONT><BR><BR>

     According to several sources, a pivotal member of the Conference was Rep. Frank Riggs (R-CA), a
     newcomer to this session but who had previously served two terms in Congress. Riggs, a member of the
     House Appropriations energy and water subcommittee from Northern California, had visited the Schatz
     Energy Research Center at Humboldt State University in Arcata earlier and had come away impressed with
     the work there on hydrogen and fuel cells. It was apparently Riggs who convinced the other conferees of the
     worth of adding a few million dollars to the hydrogen appropriation.

   <DD>  This surprise development - aided no doubt by the very smallness of the program in a place where anything
     below a million dollar tends to drop below the horizon - was in contrast to big-ticket programs such as
     "solar and renewable energy" which slid from the $326.4 million request to $187.2 million. Strongest hit
     was solar building technology research which came in at less than half of the budget request, from $4.7
     million to $2 million. Photovoltaics dropped from 88.1 to 65 million.

<FONT SIZE=6>Fuel Cells Do Well, But House Rejects Entire Interior Bill </FONT><BR>

     In general, fuel cells programs are not controversial, and they have avoided the sharp cutbacks that have
     been inflicted elsewhere. Earlier last month, the House-Senate Conference for the Interior appropriation
     voted $22 million as a compromise for the House vote of $19.4 million and the Senate's $23 million for
     transportation fuel cells, plus $38 million for fuel cell power generation programs. The compromise took
     out harsh House language which would have eliminated a direct-hydrogen fuel cell program, affecting Ford
     and Chrysler. Conferees agreed to the Senate version which did not contain those provisions. The overriding
     problem now is that the House subsequently rejected the entire Interior appropriation over mineral rights
     fees, and no resolution is in sight.

<DD>     The Defense appropriation includes $12 million for the second year of the "buy down" cost sharing program
     for fuel cell procurement, plus another $7 million for molten carbonate research. Again, the fuel cell
     portions were resolved in confer- ence but the House rejected the entire Defense bill over a dispute on
     federal financing of abortions for military personnel and dependents.

    <DD> The Transportation appropriation which has been approved in Conference, includes $5 million for fuel cell
     bus develop- ment. The entire bill has been approved in the House and is pending in the Senate, but
     transportation spending in general is on hold temporarily because of a dispute over a separate federal
     highway bill.

 <DD>    Fuel cell technology is not controversial in Congress, and some observers believe that with the basic
     numbers and issues resolved, the fuel cell language will eventually make it into law. Still resolved must be
     the even bigger threat looming over the '96 budget and the very operation of the government - Presi- dent
     Clinton's threatened veto. Both Congress and President Clinton seem eager to avoid legislative gridlock,
     however. If no budget agreement can be reached, the government's agencies may operate once again under a
     "continuing resolu- tion" in fiscal year '96, in which case the hydrogen program would be cut back to the
     current year's level of $10 million. Transportation fuel cells would be reduced to $18 million.

The international energy efficiency community suffers from a lack of systematic sharing of experience and best practices among
energy efficiency practitioners, and of clear information about how best to apply sound energy efficiency principles. There is a
need to share knowledge about successes or failures of energy efficiency policies, investment opportunities, and alternative
financing approaches. WEEA was created in 1993 to fill this void by facilitating networking and information exchange to
strengthen the capacities of governmental and private institutions with expertise in energy efficiency and renewable energy. As
of June 1995 WEEA was working with over one hundred institutions worldwide.

WEEA is committed to developing systems, both electronic and conventional, to assist practitioners in the field solve problems
encountered in implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. 

<DD>WEEA begins from the assumption that the most critical component of a network is the body of participating institutions. To
this end, WEEA is engaged in a continuous effort to catalogue and profile institutions interested in energy efficiency worldwide.
The third edition of the International Directory of Energy Efficiency Institutions is currently being revised and expanded to cover
the more than one-thousand institutions worldwide with whom WEEA has made contact. 

<DD>Electronic systems can, however, enhance the effectiveness and facilitate collaboration among an established network. WEEA
takes advantage of electronic conferencing and electronic access to reports and other information to serve the needs of this
community.

<FONT SIZE=6>WEEA has outlined the following steps to assist energy efficiency practitioners: </FONT><BR>

<DD><LI>     maintain a database of on-going sustainable energy projects worldwide to provide a realistic idea of the size of the
     market for energy efficiency; 
  <DD><LI>   improve access to existing reports and databases critical to practitioners and financiers in these fields; 
 <DD><LI>    establish electronic links among energy efficiency institutions and experts to facilitate problem solving; 
  <DD><LI>   organize WEEA working groups to discuss optimum approaches to problem solving using databases, reports and
     networking. 

<DD>The electronic portion of the WEEA information system is designed around a site on the Internet, or more specifically, the
World Wide Web. The system has been designed recognizing limitations in access to the Internet and limitations in bandwidth
in developing countries. The information will be mirrored on a gopher and FTP site, and plans are underway to produce
CD-ROMs for distribution to those without Internet access. The system is designed for an inexperienced user of electronic
resources and allows quick access to needed information. 

<DD>A portion of the information on this server is maintained in-house, but the majority of the information accessible has been
achieved through identifying existing electronic information resources and facilitating access to these sites. The Internet Energy
and Environment Sampler is WEEA's catalogue of available information resources. A print version and an electronic version
are available. 

<DD>As more institutions take advantage of the growing effectiveness of the Internet, the system will continue to grow to serve an
ever larger community. For more information on this system, please contact the World Energy Efficiency Association.

 What are CIESIN's U.S. population data resources?
<DD>     CIESIN has a range of U.S. Population data resources. CIESIN maintains an anonymous FTP archive of census
     related products that includes enhanced county to county migration files; standard extracts of 225 variables from
     the '90 Summary Tape File (STF) 3A for the various census geographies from blockgroup and up; and '92 digital
     TIGER boundary files for the various census geographies from block and up. Links to the STF extracts and
     TIGER files can be found on the U.S. Demography home page .

<DD>     CIESIN also has a cross-tabulation engine, Ulysses, that provides interactive access to the '70, '80 and '90
     decennial census Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). The engine uses a simple menuing query building
     system, and the data dictionary is on-line. Access to Ulysses is by public login: telnet infoserver.ciesin.org, login:
     ulysses.

<DD>     CIESIN can also provide custom rectangularized extracts from the 1% and 5% '80 and '90 PUMS, and the
     '68-'92 March Current Population Surveys (CPS). Submit your request to CIESIN User Services.

<DD>     In addition, CIESIN has processed U.S. population and housing densities onto a one kilometer grid using a
     proportional allocation algorithm to facilitate the integration of these data with remotely sensed data. See the
     Population, Land Use and Emissions Project home page.

 What are integrated assessment models of climate change, and how can I learn more about integrated
assessment modeling?
   <DD>  Integrated assessment models are tools for the joint assessment of:
<DD><LI>the social and economic factors that drive
     greenhouse gas emissions; 
<DD><LI>the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the global biosphere and climate; and
<DD><LI>in turn, the effects of changes in the biosphere and climate on economies and societies. You can explore a
     detailed description of integrated assessment modeling; a detailed description of selected integrated assessment
     models (IAMS)

 I need to know which countries are party to a number of international environmental agreements. How can
I find out which countries are party to which agreements? 
<DD>     The Environmental Treaties and Resource Indicators project allows you to search a relational database of
     environmental treaties, agreements and conventions, and find out which countries are party to which agreements,
     and when they became party to the agreements. There are treaty summaries, full text of treaties, and treaty status
     files for more than 120 international environmental agreements in the areas of global climate change,
     stratospheric ozone depletion, transboundary air pollution, land use/land cover change and desertification,
     conservation of biological diversity, deforestation, oceans and their living resources, trade and the environment,
     and population. By mid 1996, you will be able to relate a country's treaty status to any of a number of economic
     and natural resource indicators.

ao crescente perigo da falta de fornecimento de energia eltrica, o que desperta para
uma conscientizao forada. 
<DD>Devido  acelerada evoluo da demanda de energia, necessria para a manuteno do
ritmo do crescimento econmico e melhoria da qualidade de vida da populao,  necessrio
adotar adequadamente uma estratgia de planejamento do setor eltrico que engloba
trs polticas:
<DD><LI>Usar eficazmente os recursos energticos.
<DD><LI>investir substancialmente na obteno de recursos adicionais de energia.
<DD><LI>Saber mesclar as duas alternativas anteriores.

As experincias realizadas e os resultados obtidos em pases que adotaram o caminho da
conservao so animadores e indicam a viabilidade de se economizar energia, tanto
atravs de seu uso racional, como atravs do desenvolvimento da tecnologia.
<DD>A tendncia de conservao de energia surge como varivel importante na 
equao do atendimento aos requisitos do mercado eltrico. Porquanto, sua adoo pode:
<DD><LI>promover alternativas para a otimizao das disponibilidades, adiando investimentos
indesejveis numa conjuntura de dificuldades financeiras
<DD> <LI>contingenciar perodos hidrolgicos desfavorveis
<DD><LI> aumentar a confiabilidade dos sistemas existentes
<DD><LI>eliminar disperdcios
<DD> <LI>priorizar o uso de recursos energticos.
<DD> Adequando-se  toda complexidade do sistema eltrico,a conservao de energia
deve ser analisada tanto pelo ponto de vista do mercado, como tambm pelo ponto
de vista do subsistema de produo de energia. Neste caso, devem ser agregados a 
esses estudos o conhecimento dos fatores que determinam limitaes ou redues
aos equipamentos geradores e reservatrios, de forma a se obter uma prorrogao
da vida til dessas instalaes e reduo das paradas motivadas por fatores externos

<FONT SIZE=5> Water covers almost 70 percent of the surface of the globe and is the
Earth's most abundant resource. About 97 percent of the water is in the
oceans and is too salty for drinking, growing crops, or most other human
uses. Almost all of the freshwater is held in the ice caps of Antarctica
and Greenland or in deep underground aquifers where, for most practical
purposes, it is inaccessible for human use. Only about 0.3 percent of the
earth's freshwater, less than 100,000 cubic kilometers or 81 trillion
acre-feet (the unit of water needed to cover one acre to a depth of one
foot, which is about 326,000 gallons), is found in rivers and lakes. These
surface waters together with accessible groundwater resources comprise the
usable supply.
<DD>Water is also one of the Earth's most renewable resources. Globally, the
total quantity of water is essentially constant and unaffected by human
activities. Driven by energy from the Sun, water constantly circulates from
the seas, lakes, and streams (through evaporation) or the plants (through
transpiration) to the atmosphere and back to earth (through precipitation).
The evaporative process removes salts and other impurities that may be
picked up either naturally or as a result of human use, making it possible
to use and reuse water virtually indefinitely.

Despite the apparent global and national abundance and the renewability of
the resource, water adequacy has emerged as one of the nation's primary
resource issues. For many of the developing countries of the world the
problem is a critical one. In the USA, concerns about the availability
of freshwater to meet the demands of a growing and increasingly affluent
population while sustaining a healthy natural environment are based on
several factors: 
<DD><LI> uncertainties as to the availability of supplies
stemming from the vicissitudes of the hydrologic cycle and the threat that
a greenhouse warming might alter the cycle; 
<DD><LI> the high costs of
developing additional surface-water supplies; 
<DD><LI> the vulnerability of the
resource and the problems of restoring and protecting valued surface and
groundwater resources; 
<DD><LI> the importance of reliable supplies of
high-quality water for human and environmental health and economic
development; 
<DD><LI>the shortcomings of our institutions for allocating
scarce supplies in response to changing supply and demand conditions.

<BR CLEAR=all>
<P>



<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>
<DD>UNCERTAINTY OF SUPPLY

<DD>Timing, location, and reliability are important dimensions of the potential
value of supplies. Because of the spatial and temporal variations in the
distribution of water, national and long-term annual averages of
precipitation and runoff are poor indicators, for practical purposes, of
available supplies and potential problems. Precipitation generally declines
as one moves from east to west in the United States . Average
annual precipitation ranges from less than 1 inch in some desert areas in
the Southwest to more than 60 inches in parts of the Southeast.

<DD>Underlying these regional averages are large seasonal and annual variations
that can result in droughts and floods. In the absence of flow regulation
and storage, the ratio of the maximum to minimum streamflow within a year
may exceed 500 to 1. Natural climatic variability results in interannual
fluctuations. The ratio of very high annual flows (amounts exceeded in five
percent of the years) to very low (exceeded in 95 percent of the years) is
2.9 for the conterminous United States; the ratio for the nation's arid and
semiarid regions is significantly higher. But almost any region lacking
adequate storage is likely to encounter both periods when supplies are
relatively plentiful or even excessive as well as periods of shortages.

<DD>Water resource issues tend to be local or regional in nature: abundant
supplies in one area are of no help to water-deficit areas unless there are
facilities to transport supplies among regions. Water flows naturally
within hydrologic basins and can be moved between basins where transfer
facilities have been constructed. But water is too expensive relative to
its marginal value to transport long distances out of these existing
channels in response to climate- induced changes in supply or demand. Thus,
large seasonal, annual, interannual, and regional variations in
precipitation and runoff pose major challenges for planners and
down-to-earth risks for water users and occupants of the flood plains.

<DD>Human efforts to alter the hydrologic cycle date back to ancient times.
Primitive societies tried to bring rain through prayer, rain dances, human
and animal sacrifices, and other rituals. Cloud seeding (dropping silver
iodide crystals or dry ice into selected clouds to stimulate ice crystal
formation and induce precipitation) represents today a more recent and more
scientific, but still uncertain, attempt to influence rainfall. Although it
is questionable whether any of these intentional efforts have succeeded in
significantly modifying the rainfall, human activities are inadvertently
altering the climate. Changes in land use and land cover can affect
atmospheric circulation and the movement of moisture locally. Evaporation
from neighboring states, which depends on land use, can be the source of as
much as one-third of the precipitation of inland areas. The anthropogenic
increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases is expected to increase the average global surface
temperature. Such a change would also affect precipitation patterns,
evapotranspiration rates, the timing and magnitude of runoff, and the
frequency and intensity of storms as well as the demand for water. But the
magnitude and even the nature of these impacts on the supply and demand for
water in specific regions are largely unknown.

<FONT SIZE=5>
<DD>VULNERABILITY OF THE RESOURCE

<DD>Aquifers, which contain much of the country's usable water, are classified
as confined or unconfined. Confined aquifers are overlain by impermeable
materials and receive little or no recharge. The natural movement of water
into and out of these aquifers is so slow that they can be treated as a
stock resource that can be depleted through pumping. Unconfined aquifers,
on the other hand, are more active and integral parts of the hydrologic
cycle: continually recharged by the percolation of precipitation, snow
melt, or water from overlying streams, canals, and reservoirs. Discharges
from unconfined aquifers are the source of about 30 percent of the nation's
streamflow. Recharge and discharge rates vary with seasonal and annual
changes in precipitation and runoff as well as with pumping. In the long
term and under natural conditions, water lost through discharge is balanced
by ongoing recharge.

<DD>Pumping disrupts the equilibrium between recharge and discharge;
groundwater levels decline when water is initially withdrawn. If the rate
of pumping is not excessive, a new equilibrium is established (at a lowered
water table) in which pumping is balanced by changes in the natural rates
of discharge and recharge. Depletion can continue for decades, as it has in
the portions of the Ogallala aquifer that lie under the southern High
Plains and in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Eventually, however, if
natural flows do not adjust first, higher costs due to increased pumping
lifts and lower well yields act to reduce the rate of pumping. Higher
pumping costs have already resulted in several million acres being taken
out of irrigation in the High Plains. The San Joaquin Valley likely would
have had a similar experience were it not for the federal Central Valley
Project that provides the region with millions of acre-feet of water
annually from the Sacramento and Trinity basins in northern California. In
1980, groundwater, which provides about half of our drinking water and is
the source of nearly one-fourth of all freshwater withdrawals, was being
depleted from six western and midwestern river basins at a rate of 20.4
million acre-feet per year. In 1983 groundwater levels declined under more
than 14 million irrigated acres in eleven states in amounts ranging from 6
inches to over five feet.

<DD>Pumping from aquifers near a coastline reduces the natural discharge of
freshwater toward the sea, causing saline water to shift inland and toward
the surface. Saltwater will continue to intrude into the aquifer under
these conditions as long as pumping exceeds the flow of freshwater to the
sea. Saltwater intrusion threatens important drinking water supplies in a
number of coastal areas including Long Island; Cape Cod; seven New Jersey
counties; and the Florida cities of Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville.

<DD>Water quality is an important dimension of water supply.<FONT SIZE=6> Water is rarely
pure.</FONT> All ground and surface water contains minerals dissolved from soil
and rock, and precipitation may contain impurities picked up in the
atmosphere. The natural concentrations of contaminants in the nation's
rivers, lakes, and aquifers are generally acceptable for most human uses.
Anthropogenic factors, however, contribute a wide variety of substances
that have reduced and in some cases destroyed the utility of specific water
supplies. Despite the major progress that has been made in recent decades
in reducing municipal and industrial point sources of pollution, about
one-third of the assessed rivers, lakes, and estuaries in 1990 were judged
to be capable of only partially supporting their designated uses.

<DD>Only a small fraction of the nation's groundwater resources is known to be
contaminated such that they fail to meet drinking water standards.
Communities that rely on groundwater for drinking are subject to federal
monitoring requirements. In most other areas, however, groundwater
monitoring is infrequent or nonexistent. Effective monitoring is expensive,
and there are millions of potential sources of groundwater contamination.
For example, roughly 20 million on-site domestic waste disposal systems in
the country contain nitrates, phosphates, pathogens, inorganic
contaminants, or other toxins that could leak into neighboring groundwater
supplies. There are 1.5 million underground tanks that store hazardous
substances or petroleum products: many of them are not protected from
corrosion, and a good many have been in service beyond their expected 15 to
20 year lifetime. Other potential sources of groundwater contamination
include landfills, abandoned waste sites, oil and gas brine pits, and the
chemicals applied to most of the 325 to 375 million acres typically planted
to crops each year.

<DD>IMPORTANCE OF THE RESOURCE

<DD>Water uses are separated into instream uses and those that involve
withdrawing the resource from a surface or groundwater source. The former
include the production of hydropower, recreation, and the provision of fish
and wildlife habitat. Water is withdrawn for a variety of purposes ranging
from drinking, the removal of wastes from homes and factories, irrigation
of crops and golf courses, and snow making. Withdrawal uses are rarely
fully consumptive; on average more than 70 percent of the water withdrawn
is eventually returned to a stream or groundwater source where it can be
used again. However, when water is withdrawn and subsequently returned, it
affects, often adversely, the quality, location, or timing of the water
available for other withdrawal or instream uses.

<DD>Freshwater withdrawals for all purposes averaged more than 1,300 gallons
per person, per day in 1990 ; consumptive use averaged about 380
gallons. Per capita withdrawals peaked in 1975, and total withdrawals
peaked in 1980. The recent decline in offstream water use is due in part to
efforts to restore some of the instream values that were sacrificed in
providing for the ten-fold increase in withdrawals between 1900 and 1980.

<DD>Irrigation and thermoelectric cooling accounted for 80 percent of all
withdrawals in 1990. In the seventeen western states, irrigation alone
accounted for five of every six gallons of water consumptively used. About
100 gallons per person per day was for domestic uses such as drinking,
bathing, washing clothes and dishes, toilets, and food preparation as well
as outdoor uses such as watering lawns and gardens and washing cars.
Drinking and cooking represent only a small fraction of domestic water use,
but in the absence of dual supply systems, all domestic supplies must meet
drinking water standards.

<DD>The importance of freshwater to society is not easily measured and is
commonly overlooked when it is readily available. But, as Benjamin Franklin
suggested, we know the value of water when the well runs dry. A striking
illustration of the importance of water is provided by the plight of the
many millions of people around the world who lack ready access to clean
water. The differences between developed and developing countries are many,
but few have greater impact on human welfare than the availability of safe
drinking water and adequate sanitation. In contrast to the situation in the
United States where these basic services are taken for granted by virtually
everyone, 1.3 billion people in the developing world (almost 1/4 of all who
live on the Earth) lack access to safe drinking water supplies and 1.8
billion are without decent sanitation facilities. Water- related diseases
and illnesses exact devastating impacts on mortality and morbidity;
prospects for economic development are also decreased by the diminished
health of the labor force and the countless hours spent transporting water
for drinking and other domestic uses from distant and often contaminated
sources.

<DD>We do not need to look abroad for examples of the costs associated with
inadequate water supplies. Microorganisms in municipal drinking water
supplies have led to several outbreaks of water- borne disease in the
United States. Crytosporidium in Milwaukee's water supply resulted in some
400,000 serious illnesses and 50 deaths in the spring of 1993. Just before
Christmas 1983, contaminated drinking water in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania
caused an outbreak of giardiasis -- a common diarrheal disease -- that left
6,000 people ill and forced 75,000 others to obtain more expensive
alternative sources of drinking water. Recent droughts in the western and
southeastern regions of the United States have resulted in sizable economic
and environmental losses. Even in the absence of drought, tens of millions
of dollars worth of potential hydropower production was sacrificed in the
Colorado, Columbia, Missouri, and Sacramento river basins when water was
allocated for the preservation of fish and wildlife.

<FONT SIZE=5>
<DD>CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE

<DD>There is justifiable cause for concern over the adequacy of our water
supplies. We have limited control over the resource, most opportunities for
increasing supplies are financially and environmentally costly, and current
uses are depleting or contaminating some valued supplies. While demands for
the many services provided by water are growing, institutions have been
slow to adapt to the challenges of growing scarcity, supply vulnerability,
and rising instream values.

<DD>On the other hand, there is reason for optimism as to the long-term
adequacy of water supplies. Although the costs of freshwater are likely to
rise in the future, we are in a position today to influence the magnitude
and even the nature of those costs. Critical determinants of future water
costs will be the efficiency with which existing supplies are managed, how
supplies are allocated among competing uses, and the effectiveness and
costs of efforts to protect aquatic environments and drinking water
quality.

<DD>As the competition for water increases, all users within a hydrologic unit
or watershed become increasingly interdependent; each water use can affect
the quantity or quality available to all the others. Moreover, ground and
surface water supplies are often naturally connected such that what is done
to one affects the other. Today the interdependencies among water users and
the interchangeability of supplies are all too often ignored in management
decisions because natural hydrologic regions are split into multiple
political and administrative units; water supply facilities are under
separate ownership; and ground and surface waters are subject to quite
different laws. Integrated management of existing supplies and
infrastructure, ideally at the river basin level  but also within
smaller watersheds, is a cost-effective means of increasing reliable water
supplies and resolving water conflicts in many regions.

<DD>With demand growing faster than supply in many areas, we need to provide
appropriate incentives to conserve and protect the resource, and
opportunities to allocate supplies efficiently among competing uses. When
water is under priced and its allocation is restricted by law and
tradition, the inevitable results are inefficient water use, lost
development opportunities, interruptions in service, and higher costs for
new water users. On the other hand, when the real costs are borne by users
of the resource and there are opportunities to transfer water voluntarily
among alternative uses, then the resource is used more efficiently, there
are increased incentives to develop and adopt water-conserving
technologies, the highest-value uses are assured of an adequate supply, and
society derives greater net benefits from its scarce supplies. Efficient,
voluntary water transfers must include provisions to incorporate
third-party effects into trade decisions (since parties other than the
buyer and seller are likely to be impacted by a water transfer), without
imposing high transactions costs. The nature and magnitude of future water
costs will depend importantly on our success in developing such market
institutions.

<DD>The provision of instream benefits such as fish and wildlife habitat,
water-based recreation, and the amenities of natural waterways pose special
problems because they are not marketed. Moreover, while the adoption of
water-conserving technologies can slow or even reverse the growth in demand
for domestic, industrial, and agricultural water, technology is not likely
to offer suitable substitutes for instream uses such as fish and wildlife
habitat, water- based recreation, and the amenities of natural waterways.
Another challenge for improving water management and allocation decisions
is to develop procedures that expeditiously strike an appropriate balance
among environmental, social, and developmental values. In some instances,
environmental values continue to be slighted by institutions rooted in a
bygone era when water left in a stream was assumed to have no value. In
other cases, environmental values are introduced preemptively through
legislation such as the Endangered Species Act or through long and costly
judicial or administrative proceedings. The public interest is likely to be
better served if instream uses are considered within a basin-wide context
rather than on a project by project basis.

<DD>The United States has made impressive gains over the last two decades in
restoring and protecting its water resources. But resistance is growing to
the enormous investments that continue to be made in treating industrial
and municipal wastes because of high costs and diminishing returns. More
cost-effective approaches to water-quality goals are needed. These might
include effluent fees that provide incentives to develop and adopt
least-cost technologies, and tradable permits to pollute that establish an
allowable quantity of pollution in a watershed and provide incentives to
meet this level at the lowest cost. Non-point-source pollutants such as
runoff from farms, urban areas, and construction sites and seepage from
landfills and septic systems are now the principal sources of pollutants
reaching the nation's waters. Since these pollutants lack specific points
of discharge where they can be collected and treated, watershed management
with particular emphasis on the use of riparian (riverside) lands must be
employed to achieve significant further improvements in the quality of the
nation's waters.

<DD>Concerns regarding the safety of drinking water are still growing in spite
of the billions of dollars that are spent annually monitoring and treating
supplies. Legislative reforms are needed that would:
<DD><LI> allow local
communities to target their resources to the most pressing problems; 
<DD><LI>provide the Environmental Protection Agency more flexibility to focus on
the contaminants that pose the greatest health risks; 
<DD><LI> give greater emphasis to protecting drinking water supplies from contamination in the
first place.

<DD>In summary, with improved basin-wide management of supplies, institutions
that enable water to be transferred efficiently and expeditiously among
uses in response to changing supply and demand conditions, and
cost-effective approaches to protecting aquatic ecosystems and drinking
water supplies, reliable supplies of freshwater will be available at
readily affordable prices for the foreseeable future.

According to a 1988 federal survey, there are enough undeveloped
river sites to nearly double hydro capacity, including nearly 5,000
potential small-scale sites which could produce an additional
22,000 MW. However, a federal inter-laboratory review found economic,
                                 environmental and regulatory constraints that
                                 are likely to limit new hydro development (large
                                 and small) to only 8,000 MW by 2030. Removal
                                 of some constraints could increase this figure to
                                 16,000 MW.

Hydropower systems are loosely classified by power output
capabilities. Small-scale hydropower is broadly defined as any
system generating under 30,000 kiloWatts (kW). It is sometimes
divided into three categories: small, mini, and micro. Small hydropower
                       systems operate much like large-scale systems, but with
                       a smaller output capacity between 1,500 kW and 30,000
                       kW, which can be enough power to meet the electricity
                       of a small town.

Mini-hydropower systems generate between 100 kW and 1,500 kW.
Micro-hydro systems generate up to 100 kW. A private residence
may require between 7 and 10 kW during peak load (when many
devices are being used simultaneously).

Head (or fall) and water flow are the two key variables which
determine the hydro system most suitable for a site. The head
refers to the height of the falling water from the headwater (above
the drop) to the tailwater (below the drop). Head is usually measured in
                      meters or feet. This falling action exerts pressure which
                      converts the kinetic energy in the water into useful
                      mechanical energy by rotating a turbine shaft.

Two-thirds of all hydropower installations are "run of the river"
sites which depend entirely on the water source's constant flow to
meet peak power needs. Dams or diversion structures are typically
required for larger installations. Dams serve two hydro purposes (in
                              addition to non-hydro purposes like flood control,
                              irrigation or recreation). They store water when
                              only a small amount of energy is required. When
                              there is not enough water to produce electricity
                              during peak hours, stored water supplied by dams
                              provides extra power. Dams also can be used to
increase head in sites which do not meet head requirements.

A river or stream is channeled through turbines connected to
electric generators to produce power. The power produced by the
hydropower system is the product of three parameters: 
<DD><LI> the
difference in elevation between the intake and the outlet; 
<DD><LI> the volume of
                              the flow of water; 
<DD><LI> the efficiency of the
                              turbine/generator equipment. The interactive
                              exercise lets you explore varying these parameters,
which change the output of electricity (to try the exercise click the

For an estimate of the power available in a given stream or river,
the following formula may be used: 
<DD><FONT SIZE=6> P = 10 x Q x H x efficiency</FONT>
<DD>Power = 10 x flow x fall x
efficiency where "power" is measured in kilowatts, "flow" in cubic
                                meters per second, and "fall" in meters.
                                Efficiency includes that of the turbines and the
generators. Friction losses in the system are usually factored into the
equation by decreasing the "fall" variable by an appropriate amount.

particularly to salmon which periodically come to spawn in the
upper reaches of rivers. One solution has been creating fish ladders and

Small-scale hydropower provided 1,055 trillion Joules of energy in
Hawaii in 1992, about one-third of one percent of the state's total
energy consumption. There are 20 hydropower plants located on
the Islands of Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. Seven small-scale plants, ranging
                        in size from 500 kilowatts (kW) to 3,700 kW are located
                        on Kauai, operated by four different sugar companies.
                        In 1992 these hydropower plants supplied 11 percent of
                        Kauai's electricity needs. Four hydropower plants are
                        operated on Maui by two sugar companies. These plants
                        furnished approximately 2 percent of Maui's electrical

operation on Wailuku Stream in 1993. It generates about 34
million kWh of electricity annually, enough to power 11,000 homes
and replace 83,000 barrels of imported oil. A diversion channel was dug to

site selection and basic layout are among the first which must be
considered if operational and maintenance problems encountered
during the life of a project are to be minimized. Such problems contribute
                                    to recurring costs of a project and could
                                    discourage future developments. The
                                    topography must be suitable for hydropower
                                    generation.

Hydro projects with dams can provide better control of electricity
flow throughout the year, like satisfying peak electrical demands
even during periods of low stream or river flow. This improved
performance needs to be evaluated against the dam's additional expense of
                       construction and maintenance.

Although non-polluting, hydropower presents environmental
concerns which must be investigated before a system is installed.
Hydropower systems can obstruct fish migration paths, creating
problems with fish populations. Often during spawning season, schools of
                          fish swim through a site and are killed by the rotating
                          turbine. For example, in the northwest U.S., large
                          portions of the salmon population have been
                          decimated by the combined impact of hydropower
                          facilities, agriculture, fishing and industrial activities
                          on the flow and quality of the water. There are,
                          however, ways to divert the fish away from the
turbine.

A hydropower system may possess other features which offer much
more than just electricity or mechanical energy. Hydropower sites
often offer means for irrigation, fire control, drinking water, and
                        recreational fishing and boating. Total costs of all
                        services provided by the water in some sites may be less
                        than the cost of purchasing each service separately.

Two-thirds of the precipitation is quickly evaporated and transpired back
to the atmosphere; the remaining one-third flows into the nation's lakes,
rivers, groundwater reservoirs, and eventually to the ocean .
These flows provide a potential renewable supply of 1,400 bgd, which is
nearly fifteen times current daily consumptive use -- the quantity of water
withdrawn from but not returned to a usable water source. Moreover, much
larger quantities of freshwater are stored in the nation's surface and
groundwater reservoirs. Reservoirs behind dams can store about 280,000
billion gallons (about 860 million acre- feet), even larger quantities are
stored in lakes, and water stored in aquifers (subterranean bodies of
unconsolidated materials such as sand, gravel, and soil that are saturated
with water and sufficiently permeable to produce water in useful
quantities) within 2,500 feet of the earth's surface is at least 100 times
the reservoir capacity. These stocks are equivalent to more than fifty
years renewable supply.

The United States has invested large sums of private and public money to
adapt to the vicissitudes of the hydrologic cycle. A vast infrastructure of
dams, reservoirs, canals, pumps, and levees has been constructed over the
years to collect, control, and contain surplus flows and to distribute
water on demand during low as well as high flow periods. As a result, most
water users take for granted that virtually unlimited quantities of
freshwater will be available at the turn of a tap. Moreover, the nation's
water use patterns have come to reflect a disregard for the limits of
natural hydrological conditions; the highest levels of use and the lowest
prices are often found in the more arid areas of the country. But, as
droughts and floods frequently remind us, water often is not where we want
it, when we want it.

More than 75,000 dams and reservoirs with a storage capacity of about 860
million acre-feet help convert the United States' naturally varying water
resources into more reliable and controlled supplies. Even though currently
developed storage represents only about 70 percent of the potential
reservoir capacity, dam construction has slowed to a trickle in recent
years. Moreover, future increases in assured water supplies for municipal,
industrial, and irrigation use through the addition of surface reservoir
capacity are likely to be modest for several reasons.
</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=all>
<P>



<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>
First, sedimentation is reducing existing reservoir capacity each year by
about 1.5 million acre-feet (maf). Second, sizable investments are required
to rehabilitate, maintain, and in some cases, remove dams. A 1992 national
dam inventory classified almost a third of all dams in the United States as
hazardous: more than 10,000 dams as having a high hazard potential and
another 13,500 with a significant hazard potential. The consequences of a
dam failure can be catastrophic. In 1972, 125 people died and more than
3,000 were left homeless when Beaver Creek Dam in West Virginia failed. In
1977, 14 were killed and more than $1 billion in damages resulted from the
failure of Teton Dam in Idaho, and 39 were killed when Kelly Barnes Dam in
Georgia failed.

<DD>Third, the best sites for storing water are the first to be developed
within a river basin. Consequently, subsequent increases in storage
generally require an ever larger investment. A study of decadal changes in
reservoir storage capacity per unit volume of dam for the 100 largest dams
in the United States suggests that sharply diminishing returns are already
the case: the average reservoir capacity produced per cubic yard of dam
declined 35-fold between the 1920s and 1960s.

<DD>Fourth, there are diminishing returns in the "safe yield" produced by
successive increases in reservoir capacity within a river basin. At some
point the increase in evaporation losses due to increased reservoir surface
area can more than offset any gains in safe yield associated with
additional surface storage. A study of U.S. river basins suggests that safe
yield reaches a maximum when the ratio of storage to average annual
renewable supply is in the range of 1.6 to 4.6. By this criterion the point
of negative returns may have already been reached in three major basins --
the Lower Colorado, the Upper Colorado, and the Rio Grande, where the
ratios of storage to average renewable supply are now within this range.

<DD>The fifth, and perhaps most important, reason for the inevitability of
rising water costs is that the remaining opportunities for adding storage
are now far more restricted by environmental concerns: the environmental
costs of storing and diverting water increase as the number of free-flowing
streams declines and as society attaches more value to water left in a
stream. To the extent that water projects control flooding and capture
water that otherwise would be lost to human use as a result of evaporation
or runoff to the oceans or other unusable sinks, such facilities increase
usable freshwater supplies. However, as water development expands and the
resource becomes increasingly scarce (that is, when using water for one use
adversely affects its availability for other uses), construction of another
dam and reservoir on a river may add little, if anything, to the overall
supply. Rather, the project may only provide a means of allocating supplies
among alternative uses, usually from instream uses such as fish and
wildlife habitat and recreation to withdrawal uses such as irrigation or
domestic supplies. Examples are found in basins where the flows are already
highly controlled and intensively used, such as the Colorado River Basin.
The value of the water that is taken from instream uses (such as
hydroelectric power generation and habitat for fish and wildlife) when more
water is withdrawn becomes an important factor in the economic costs (both
financial and environmental) of augmenting a region's effective supply of
water for domestic, industrial, or agricultural use.

Public resistance to the high financial and environmental costs associated
with the traditional means of augmenting water supplies has forced
suppliers to consider a number of alternative approaches to increasing
reliable supplies such as recycling wastewater, desalination, and more
exotic schemes.

<DD>INSTITUTIONAL SHORTCOMINGS

<DD>The opportunities as well as the incentives to use, abuse, conserve, or
protect water supplies are the result of many fragmented local, state, and
federal water institutions. These institutions determine how tradeoffs
among alternative water uses are made and whether high- quality water is
likely to be available for drinking, new development opportunities,
water-based recreation, or fish and wildlife habitat. Water adequacy would
be less of a concern were these institutions more effectively interlinked
and more capable of efficiently protecting the quality of drinking supplies
and valued aquatic ecosystems and of allocating scarce supplies to higher
value uses in response to changing supply and demand conditions.

<DD>High rates of water withdrawals are a legacy of past laws and policies that
historically favored offstream over instream uses. During the first
two-thirds of this century water policy was dominated by the view that it
is wasteful to leave resources unused that are capable of producing crops,
power, or other products. Water was free for the taking, and most users
enjoyed virtually unlimited supplies at low cost during all but the most
extreme droughts. But the environmental costs of ignoring the impacts on
instream flows were high; thousands of miles of once free-flowing streams
were lost and the quality of many streams and lakes deteriorated such that
they were unusable for most purposes. The engineering and diversion of the
nation's rivers contributed to the sharp decline in the nation's wetlands,
which store floodwater, control erosion, provide fish and wildlife habitat,
improve water quality, and furnish recreational opportunities.

<DD>During the last quarter century, the policy focus has shifted almost 180o
toward protecting remaining flows and recovering some of the environmental
and recreational benefits that were sacrificed in the drive to provide
homes, factories, and farms with inexpensive water. This shift is evident
in a number of legislative acts. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968
precludes development activities that might significantly alter an area's
natural amenities on thousands of miles of rivers and streams. The National
Environmental Policy Act of 1970 requires all federal agencies to give full
consideration to environmental effects in planning their programs. The
Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972 (commonly known as the
Clean Water Act) together with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 and
other legislation regulating the use and cleanup of toxic materials have
made water quality rather than water supply the driving force behind the
nation's water-related investments. The expenditure of more than $500
billion on water pollution control since 1972 has produced major
improvements in the quality of U.S. surface water resources in the face of
increasing population and economic pressures.

<DD>The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 has come to dominate water
management and investment decisions in the Pacific Northwest. Since 1982
the Northwest Power Planning Council has supervised the expenditure of more
than $1.7 billion for measures to rebuild salmon stocks. Despite these
costly efforts, three stocks of salmon that spawn in the Snake River are
listed as threatened or endangered, petitions have been filed for listing
several other stocks, and as many as eighty-five salmon stocks throughout
the Columbia River basin are so weakened that they could be granted
protection under the ESA.

<DD>The ESA could have a similar impact on water management in California where
the Delta smelt, whose prime habitat is the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
has been granted protection. Protecting the habitat of the smelt or other
Delta species that are under consideration for protection would limit the
ability to export water from the Delta to the millions of people in central
and southern California who depend on its supply for domestic, industrial,
and agricultural uses. The ESA has been invoked to alter water investment
and management decisions in other areas, including putting a hold on the
$590 million Animas-La Plata project in the Colorado River Basin.

<DD>The Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986 (ECPA), which requires the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to give power and non-power benefits
equal consideration in its licensing and relicensing decisions, has made
hydropower relicensing another battleground in the struggle over
alternative water uses. The United States has more than 2,300 hydroelectric
power plants with a total capacity of 73,500 megawatts; annual production
in 1993 of 265 billion kilowatt hours accounted for about 9% of U.S.
electrical power generation. Most of these plants operate under federal
licenses that were issued as many as fifty years ago, when fewer questions
were raised about the effects of hydropower on fish and wildlife habitat.
As the licenses expire, the utilities are faced with a complex, costly, and
time-consuming relicensing process under ECPA that is likely to require a
detailed environmental assessment of a plant's impacts on fish and wildlife
habitat, water quality, recreation, land use, local communities, and
cultural resources. If a new license is eventually granted, it is apt to be
encumbered with restrictions that diminish the value of the plant's power
output.

<DD><FONT SIZE=6>RECYCLING</FONT>

<DD>The technology now exists to upgrade wastewater to meet standards for
domestic use, and wastewater recycling is certain to become an increasingly
important source of new water in the coming decades in many areas. Although
public resistance is still a barrier to the use of reclaimed water for
drinking, recycling for other uses is more and more common. California, the
leading consumer of recycled water in the United States, uses about 325,000
acre-feet of recycled water annually for industrial cooling, groundwater
recharge, barriers against salt-water intrusion, and irrigating landscapes,
parks, golf courses, and certain crops.

<DD>The economics of recycling are driven in large part by the environmental
and health regulations that dictate how communities collect and treat waste
water. It costs about $430-$490 to recycle an acre-foot of water, which is
several times what most cities paid to develop existing supplies. About
three-fourths of the cost of recycling wastewater is incurred meeting
federal requirements that effluent discharged into waterways undergo
certain minimal treatment. The marginal costs of the additional
purification needed to make the water suitable for unrestricted
agricultural use and of storing and conveying the upgraded water to the
user are only about $125 per acre-foot, which is competitive with
alternative sources of new supplies in many areas.

<FONT SIZE=5>
<DD><FONT SIZE=6>DESALINATION</FONT>

<DD>Almost unlimited quantities of sea water are available to coastal areas,
and brackish waters containing salt levels too high for most uses are
available in many aquifers and inland seas. The cost of desalination
depends on the quantity of salts removed. It is less expensive if the
process starts with brackish water -- with salt concentrations well below
the 35,000 parts per million characteristic of sea water -- and if the
finished water is not treated to meet drinking water standards.
Technological advances have reduced desalting costs as much as 50 percent
during the last three decades, and future improvements may have the
potential of still further reductions. Still, desalination of sea water
today costs about $1,800 an acre-foot, and is energy-intensive, making it a
supply of last resort. Brackish water, on the other hand, might be upgraded
to drinking-water for less than half this cost.

<FONT SIZE=5>
<DD><FONT SIZE=6>Other potential sources of supply</FONT>

<DD>Weather modification through cloud seeding, though controversial, is still
seen by some as a promising, low-cost way to increase water supplies in
arid and semiarid areas. While the impact of seeding on precipitation
remains difficult to measure, winter orographic clouds (formed by
encounters with elevated features such as mountain ranges) have been seeded
in areas of the western United States for nearly half a century, increasing
seasonal precipitation in some areas, by some reports, by about 10 percent.
Recent research suggests that other seeding materials might condense
precipitation from clouds of higher temperatures and thus in other seasons.

<DD>Proponents argue that in areas with favorable conditions cloud seeding can
supplement water supplies for about $10 an acre-foot. But even if the
technology is improved and the economics are favorable, the potential
impact on water supplies is likely to be small and geographically limited.
Moreover, legal barriers may restrict its use. Towns receiving more snow
might object to higher snow- removal costs; downstream residents might
suffer increased spring flooding; and downwind communities might feel that
they are being deprived of precipitation that otherwise would have fallen
on them.

<DD>Vegetation management, such as removing phreatophytes (high-water-use
plants that thrive along streams, such as trees of the willow family) or
managing forests for increased water yields, could increase water supplies
in some areas. The financial costs of vegetation management may be
competitive with other supply augmentation alternatives, but environmental
concerns may limit its use: phreatophyte removal is likely to have adverse
effects on wildlife habitat, and managing forests for increased water
yields may conflict with commercial timber production and recreational
opportunities.

<DD>Growing water scarcity in the arid and semiarid West has fostered a number
of bold proposals to utilize the enormous quantities of water stored in
polar ice  or to divert northern rivers in the largely uninhabited
areas of Canada and Alaska. However, the technical, economic, legal, and
environmental obstacles to transporting and using icebergs to supplement
water supplies in an area such as southern California currently appear
insurmountable. The enormous financial and environmental costs of proposals
such as the North American Water and Power Alliance that would transport
110 million acre-feet of water annually (about eight times the average
annual flow of the Colorado River) from Alaska and northern Canada to the
western United States and northern Mexico have relegated them to the realm
of science fiction for the foreseeable future.

<DD>Ideally, in a system of hydroelectric plants, water should be allocated to
the units in time intervals that allow each unit to be operated at the most
efficient output (kW/cfs) for the prevailing head. The system's required
hydroelectric generation is produced from the cluster of units by
staggering the individual times of operation. This will maximize the
hydraulic energy that can be obtained from the available quantity of water.

<DD>To achieve this level of efficient operation the volumes of water must be
compatible with the unit characteristics. Management of water resources is
closely integrated with power scheduling. Reservoir inflow forecasts are
part of the optimization for generation scheduling and unit commitments.

<DD>Integrated optimization of water management and power scheduling provides
efficiency improvements comparable to machinery upgrades. These
improvements arise directly from the widespread use of easy to use, low
cost desktop computing, and inexpensive hydrologic monitoring and data
transmission facilities.

<FONT SIZE=6>Decision Support Systems</FONT>

<DD>Improvements in water and power management have been delayed by the
apparent complexity of the water and power systems. In practice this
difficulty now has been minimized by adept use of real-time data and
software that is tailored to serve the people making the operating
decisions. This type of computer system is a "decision support system". The
heart of a decision support system is the computer interface to data
management, forecasting, current system status, and optimization routines.

<DD>SCADA installations provide real-time displays of the operating status of
equipment. Decision support systems go one step further. They show the
hydrologic and load forecast of what will happen soon, with suggestions for
scheduling the hydroelectric facilities.

<DD>Decision support systems are made practical by access to powerful windows
based compilers that incorporate dynamic data exchange with SCADA software,
and object linking embedded among concurrently running programs. These
programming capabilities provide the power system operator with customized
software that incorporates the relational data base, graphics, and simple
mouse driven controls into the programs that develop the operating
recommendations.

<DD>The decision support system develops recommendations by optimization within
regulatory constraints, physical limitations of the facilities, and
environmental and economic objectives.

<DD>Decision support systems provide shift superintendents and power schedulers
with quickly responsive and easy to use automatic integrated optimization
of water control and generation. Trial and error is eliminated, and
consistency among operators, and efficient utilization of water, is
achieved.

<FONT SIZE=6>Hydrologic Forecasting</FONT>

<DD>Realistic forecasts utilize a conceptual hydrologic model to track soil
moisture, ground water discharge, and snow conditions on the watershed, and
propagation of flood waves through the river system. The model is driven by
weather and river data recorded at key locations and transmitted via land
line, radio, or satellite directly to the power operations decision support
system. In North America, these types of data are accessible from a
commercial satellite.

<DD>Hydrologic forecasts are embedded in the decision support system, and are
virtually automatic. Before passing the forecast on to the operations
analysis, the operator uses the decision support system to interpret the
forecast and to assess its reliability.

<FONT SIZE=6>Scheduling for Reregulation by Channel Routing</FONT>

<DD>For plants having minimal storage, the hourly schedule for the units at
upstream plants in a cascade must be timed so that at downstream plants the
units can be loaded efficiently. The decision support system's knowledge of
the hydrodynamic behaviour of the river between may be a key factor.

<DD>Scheduling to avoid spill requires integration of generating unit
characteristics and hydrology. Even small pools provide opportunity for
reregulation. In a cascade of dams, the optimal dispatch of individual
generating units should incorporate accurate routing and forecasts of local
inflow between pools. This is most important when peaking operations cause
hydraulic transients in the river channel.

<DD>Calibrated routing equations are tailored to practical needs. Optimization
automatically schedules the unit dispatch and/or spillway gate operations
to use the dynamic storage in channel networks and the limited storage in
small pools between the dams.

<DD>Operating decisions for systems of interconnected reservoirs will optimize
the timing of releases to match forecasted local inflow hydrographs, the
characteristics of the river channels, and the efficiency performance of
the generating units.

<FONT SIZE=6>Complexity Provides Flexibility</FONT>

<DD>Water scheduling is wasteful if it does not consider generating units
scheduling. The voluntary constraint from non-integrated management is most
important if there are only a few units in the powerhouse, or if the
operational storage is small in the downstream pools. In principle,
voluntary constraints become less important if a larger integrated system
of rivers, reservoirs, and generating units, can be dispatched together in
an optimal manner.

<FONT SIZE=6>Computer Programs for Hydroelectric System Operations</FONT>

<DD>Reservoirs are used to capture runoff and to regulate streamflow, based on
knowledge of hydrology and the probability of future runoff. Time scales
for hydrology range from hours to seasons, and sometimes over years.

<DD>The operation of electricity generation and transmission facilities
obviously places demands on the reservoirs. But traditionally, dispatching
and scheduling has been a job for electrical and mechanical engineers who
are trained to understand system stability concerns, requirements to
minimize VARS, and the operating characteristics of the machinery. Time
scales for equipment operations range from seconds to hours and days.

<DD>Older computer programs for hydroelectric operations tend to be organized
in a similar hierarchy. Forecasting and scheduling water has been one
computer program's job; scheduling and dispatching units is another
computer program's job. It is obvious that both jobs should be done
together in an integrated optimization. Many factors are included in
decision support systems - regulatory, economic, hydrological, and
equipment capabilities. Time scales range from current unit settings to
seasonal operating plans for reservoirs. Decision support systems have been
implemented on electrically connected river basins, cascades of dams, and
single power stations.

<DD>Decision support software considers flood operations and power dispatching.
It incorporates hydrologic forecasting, reservoir storage optimization
during floods, and to meet seasonal requirements, tide and backwater
forecasting, and channel routing. Hourly schedules include spillway gate
and generating unit operations.

<FONT SIZE=6>Planning for Upgrades and Capacity Expansion
</FONT>
<DD>Integrating water management with unit operations improves power system
planning. In the past, hydrologists and economists developed reservoir
system models with powerplants, not generating units - as if the plants
operate like a single generating unit. A second step, by engineering
specialists, then considered plans at the level of individual units. Now,
by incorporating individual units into the reservoir system models,
additional flexibility and reality, is gained in planning. Short term
benefits are derived from more realistic rate reviews; long term benefits
are realized in selecting optimal dates for scheduled maintenance, unit
upgrades, and capacity expansion. The resulting improved utilization of
existing facilities reduces the apparent benefit from plant upgrades,
substituting software for hardware.

Real-time satellite downlink systems for basin-wide hydrologic data no
longer are the prerogative of agencies of government. Affordable, easy to
use hardware and software installations are within reach of the smallest
hydro operators. Decision support systems now use these data to provide
power plant operators with timely hydrologic forecasts.

<DD<Decision support software is tailored to the specific needs of the shift
supervisor that uses it. Operating schedules are responsive to changing
circumstances and consistently provide viable water management decisions
that make the best possible use of the generating equipment and the
available water resources.

<DD>There is a close linkage between computer models for operations and for
planning. Decision support systems provide the capability for improved
dialogues between hydroelectric operators, and regulators,
environmentalists, and economists.

<DD>Decision support systems now in use are a revolutionary departure from the
labor intensive mainframe computer models of earlier times. They are point
and click desk top computer techniques that manage and display data,
operating status, and the results of sophisticated, comprehensive analyses.
Decision support systems emphasize ease of use and consistency in power
operations. They make possible the Optimal Integrated Scheduling of
Reservoirs and Generating Units.

As centers of population and human activities, cities consume natural resources from both near and distant sources.
They also generate waste that is disposed of both inside and outside the city. In the process, urban areas generate
environmental problems over a range of spatial scales: the household and workplace, the neighborhood, the city, the
wider region, and the globe .

Urban environmental problems also create a range of social impacts. They may impair human health, cause economic
and other welfare losses, or damage the ecosystems on which both urban and rural areas depend. Most urban
environmental problems entail all three of these impacts, either directly or indirectly. For example, urban air pollution
has a direct impact on human health, increasing the incidence of respiratory disease. Its impact on the economy is
mainly indirect, arising largely from productivity losses due to ill health .

<FONT SIZE=6>Determinants of Urban Environmental Problems</FONT><BR>

Environmental problems vary from city to city and region to region and are influenced by such variables as a city's size
and rate of growth, income, local geography, climate, and institutional capabilities. Especially where local governments
are weak or underfinanced, rapid economic or population growth can exacerbate th ese problems. Environmental
management tends to be more difficult in very large cities. For one, the financial resources needed to provide services
to tens of millions of people are daunting. Compounding the d ifficulty is the fact that the largest cities often are made
up of many local jurisdictions with overlapping responsibilities .

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point2.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>
<FONT SIZE=6>Income</FONT><BR>

One of the most important determinants of a city's environmental problems is its income level. As the wealth of a city
grows, many types of environmental degradation first increase and then eventually diminish. Other environmental
problems increase with wealth.

<DD>The income level at which a city undergoes these changes differs widely. Vastly different environmental conditions can
be found in cities of comparable wealth. Policies, as well as demography and geography, can make an enormous
difference.

<DD>In poor cities, and particularly their poor neighborhoods, the most threatening environmental problems are usually
those close to home . The dangers of exposure to environmental risks are high, especially for women and
children. Inadequate household water supplies are typically more crucial to people's well-being than polluted
waterways. There is often more exposure to air pollution in smoky kitchens than outdoors. Waste accumulating,
uncollected, in the neighborhood poses more serious problems than the waste at the city dumps. Human excreta is
frequently the most critical pollutant, and unsanitary conditions in the home and neighborhood are generally more of a
threat to health than industrial pollution.

<DD>These problems, so prevalent in cities in the developing world, stem from myriad causes, including the inability or
unwillingness of local governments to provide for basic needs of citizens--which in turn stems from a lack of
revenue-generating capacity. Another key factor is the poor's lack of access to suitable land for housing.

<DD>As income increases, urban households and cities as a whole consume far more resources, such as energy, water, and
building materials-- and generate far more of certain types of wastes. Yet the rich devote part of their wealth to
measures that protect them from environmental hazards. The problems close to home are the first to improve as wealth
increases, generally because they are the most threatening and require cooperation on only a relatively small scale.
However, while these improvements reduce personal exposure, they often simply shift the problem elsewhere.
Waterborne sewage systems, for example, reduce personal exposure to fecal material. However, if sewage is discharged
without treatment, it can lower the quality of a city's waterways and strain water supplies. Electricity is a clean fuel
where it is used, but electric power plants can be an important source of ambient air pollution.

<DD>Thus, even as household and neighborhood environmental problems recede from prominence for a growing number of
a city's population, citywide and regional problems, such as ambient air pollution, water pollution, and hazardous
waste generation, may increase. These problems tend to be severe in rapidly industrializing cities of the developing
world and in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe, where industrial activity often occurs without
adequate concern for its environmental implications.  Lack of investment in urban infrastructure, such as
increased road networks and sewage treatment plants, and weak environmental protection laws with lax enforcement,
exacerbate these problems.

<DD>In high-income cities, such as those in Europe and North America, many of the worst city-level problems have been
addressed. For instance, many cities in the developed world have improved the quality of their ambient air and water
over the past decades. A wealthy city can more easily afford the public finance and administration needed to regulate
the more perceptible forms of pollution.

<DD>But while the ambient environment of high-income cities may actually be more benign in terms of the health impacts of
pollution, these cities exert a far greater toll on the regional and global environment. The resources consumed and
greenhouse gases emitted to support even the cleanest cities in developed countries are, on a per capita basis, far greater
than those associated with the poorer cities of developing regions. Indeed, the largest per capita urban contributors to
global environmental problems are the wealthy, living preponderantly in the urban areas of the developed world.

<DD>Not confronted with the direct impacts of their activities on the global environment, wealthy cities and countries tend
to have fewer incentives to address them. In manufacturing, for example, relatively little progress has been made in
introducing "clean" production in the broadest sense of the term or in shifting from the linear material flows that
characterize most modern technologies to the closed cycles that many advocate . As with global warming, the
costs are often seen as too uncertain or too distant to compel action now.

<DD>In its broad outlines, the transition summarized above suggests an association among a city's wealth, its environment,
and the health of its citizens. Generally, the poor create environmental problems for themselves and their neighbors,
while the wealthy create problems for a wider public.

<FONT SIZE=6>Natural Features</FONT><BR>

The natural features of a city and its surroundings--its geography, topography, and climate--are also critical
determinants of the nature of its environmental problems. Climate, for instance, determines which disease vectors can
thrive. London has been spared from malaria not because of its wealth but because it is too cold for the mosquito
vector to survive. Mexico City and Los Angeles are especially plagued by air pollution not only from the number of
cars per capita--associated with income--but also because they are bounded by mountains that prevent dispersal of air
pollutants. Cities in cold regions often confront air pollution problems stemming from energy use for domestic
heating, especially where low-quality coal is used, as in northern China and Eastern Europe .

<DD>When natural features are combined with the level and type of economic activity, they can be used to predict which
types of problems are likely to be severe in different types of cities . For example, air pollution problems tend to
rise with temperature extremes. In cold areas, more fuel is used for heating; in warm, sunny areas, contributions to
ozone formation increase owing to the release of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, particularly from motor vehicle
fuel. Air pollution also rises with income level because, as is described above, levels of car use, industrial production,
and fuel consumption are higher in wealthier cities.

<FONT SIZE=6>The Brown Agenda</FONT><BR>

Although most of the world's population will soon be living in developing world cities, the environmental problems
most prominent in these cities have often been conspicuously absent from the global environmental agenda. Indeed,
over the past two decades the global agenda has shifted away from local and regional problems such as air pollution
and inadequate water supplies toward vast global concerns such as ozone depletion, climate change, and the loss of
biological diversity .

<DD>Aware of this disconnect between the "green" agenda and the problems confronting cities, a number of researchers,
international donor agencies, and nongovernmental organizations over the past few years have advocated a renewed
focus on the "brown" agenda--that is, the problems of pollution, poverty, and environmental hazards in cities 
. As one scholar noted, "The adverse effects of household airborne and water-carried wastes on child
mortality and female life expectancy are of no less global proportion than, say, the destruction of tropical forests, and in
immediate human terms, they may be the most urgent of all worldwide environmental problems" . This is not to
argue for less attention to global concerns, but for the recognition that urban and global concerns are intertwined and
must both be addressed. This section focuses on the "brown" problems so prominent in many of the world's cities.

<FONT SIZE=6>Water and Sanitation</FONT><BR>

One of the greatest threats to human health in the developing world is the lack of adequate water and sanitation
services. The International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade brought significant progress--the number of
urban residents with access to an adequate water supply increased by approximately 80 percent--but those gains were
overshadowed by rapid population growth. In 1994, at least 220 million people still lacked a source of potable water
near their homes .

<DD>These statistics probably underestimate the actual number of people inadequately served. Definitions of what
constitutes an adequate amount of safe drinking water and sanitation vary from country to country. Although many
governments classify the existence of a water tap within 100 meters of a house as "adequate," such a tap does not
guarantee that the individual household will be able to secure enough water for good health. Communities of 500
inhabitants or more are often served by one tap . Communal taps often function only a few hours each day, so
residents must wait in long lines to fill even one bucket. For example, in Lucknow, India, a city with almost 2 million
people, water is available only 10 hours each day . In smaller cities, the situation can be much worse. In Rajkot,
India, for example, a city with a population of 600,000, the piped water runs for only 20 minutes each day .
Households cannot obtain sufficient water for washing, laundry, and personal hygiene if it takes too long to fetch and if
the water has to be carried long distances.

<DD>Statistics on national coverage also hide inequalities within a city. Although 80 percent of high-income urban residents
in the developing world have a house-connected water supply, only 18 percent of low-income residents do . In
many cities in developing countries, per capita water availability in marginal settlements can be anywhere from 3 to 10
times less than in better- off neighborhoods . Those without access to a safe water supply must buy
water from vendors at costs of anywhere from 4 to 100 times higher than the cost of water from a piped city supply
. In Lima, Peru, a poor family pays more than 20 times what a middle-class family pays for water .

<DD>The proportion of the urban population covered by sanitation services is even smaller. More than 420 million urban
residents do not have access to even the simplest latrine . Many resort instead to open defecation on land or in
waterways. As with the statistics on adequate water, estimates of the number unserved are probably low because they
do not reflect the actual functioning or use of the facilities.

<DD>These figures also hide considerable inequalities among the rich and poor. In developing countries, 8 percent of urban
low-income dwellers have a house sewer connection, compared with 62 percent of urban high-income dwellers .
Low-income families often share latrines with 100 or more other community members, and long lines or overflowing
tanks deter residents from using them at all.

<DD>Poor sanitation poses health hazards through several routes-- including direct exposure to feces near homes,
contaminated drinking water, ingestion of fish from polluted waters, and ingestion of produce that has been fertilized
by wastewater. Inadequate access to water and sanitation facilities is the main cause for the intestinal diseases,
transmitted by feces, that are so prevalent in developing countries. Two of these diseases, diarrhea and intestinal worm
infections, account for an estimated 10 percent of the total burden of disease in developing countries .

<DD>An estimated 2 million fewer children would die from diarrheal diseases each year if all people had access to adequate
water and sanitation facilities, according to the World Bank . Diarrheal diseases alone killed more than 3 million
children in 1993 and cause some 1.8 billion episodes of illness annually .

<FONT SIZE=6>Wastewater Disposal</FONT><BR>

In the developing world, it is estimated that more than 90 percent of sewage is discharged directly into rivers, lakes, and
coastal waters without treatment of any kind . Of India's 3,119 towns and cities, only 8 have full wastewater
collection and treatment facilities; 209 have partial treatment facilities . Even in higher-income countries such as
Chile, where sanitation services are relatively well developed, domestic wastewater is still the main threat to water
quality. Santiago has only one small pilot wastewater treatment plant, which processes a mere 4 percent of the city's
wastewater; the rest is dumped into the rivers that run through the city .

<DD>Disposal of domestic wastewater remains a problem, although by no means as severe, in wealthier regions as well. In
member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), approximately one third
of the population is still not served by wastewater treatment plants . Many older U.S. cities have outmoded sewer
systems that collect wastewater and storm water together, so that when rainfall is heavy, untreated wastewater is
released through overflow drains .

<FONT SIZE=6>Indoor Air Pollution</FONT><BR>

Indoor air pollution from burning of low-quality fuels, such as charcoal or animal dung, has been largely considered a
rural problem. Yet many urban residents of the developing world rely on biomass fuels for cooking and heating. In
many smaller urban centers in Asia and Africa, between 50 and 90 percent of domestic energy supplies come from
these materials . Exposure tends to be highest for women and young children, who often spend many hours
indoors and cooking over open fires; indeed, they face greater exposure to pollutants from indoor than outdoor air
.

<DD>Data are scarce on the number of people affected by indoor air pollution, especially urban residents, but in 1992 the
World Bank identified indoor air pollution as one of the four most critical global environmental problems .
Indoor air pollution contributes to acute respiratory infections in young children and chronic lung diseases and cancer
in adults . Acute respiratory infections, principally pneumonia, are the chief killers of young children in
developing countries, accounting for an estimated 10 percent of the total burden of disease. Smoke contributes to acute
respiratory infections that cause an estimated 4 million deaths annually among infants and children .

<FONT SIZE=6>Urban Air Pollution</FONT><BR>

Worldwide, more than 1.1 billion people live in urban areas with unhealthful air , exposed to a cocktail of
pollutants released from industrial, energy, and vehicular sources. Air pollution is particularly severe in megacities
such as Beijing, Seoul, Mexico City, and Cairo, Egypt, each of which exceeds WHO guidelines for at least two of the
pollutants that WHO monitors . In Mexico City, suspended particulate matter from vehicles and others sources
contributes to 6,400 deaths each year, and 29 percent of all children have unhealthy blood lead levels . The World
Bank estimates that if particulate levels alone were reduced to WHO guidelines, between 300,000 and 700,000
premature deaths per year could be avoided globally . That is the equivalent of roughly 2 to 5 percent of all deaths
in urban areas that have excessive levels of particulates. In addition, chronic coughing in urban children under age 14
could be reduced by half, or about 50 million cases annually, reducing the chance that these children will face
permanent respiratory damage . Improving urban air quality should also reduce the incidence of chronic and
infectious respiratory diseases.

<DD>Urban air quality in the more developed countries has generally improved over the past two decades, largely from
advances in controlling emissions from stationary sources such as power plants. Rising motor vehicle use, in part
reflecting the increasingly sprawling form of many cities, now poses the greatest threat to air quality .
By contrast, urban air quality has generally deteriorated throughout the developing world and the formerly socialist
economies. The reasons are increasing power generation, rising industrial activity, and rising motor vehicle
use--especially of poorly maintained vehicles that use leaded fuel .

<DD>Air quality seems likely to worsen with rapid urban growth unless rigorous pollution control measures are put into
effect. In many cities in developing countries, motor vehicle use per capita is relatively low, so cars are still a minor
contributor to air pollution. Car ownership, however, is sparked by both increasing incomes and urbanization and is
expected to skyrocket. In 1990, the global vehicle fleet (excluding two- and three-wheel vehicles)totaled some 580
million, but this will grow to an estimated 816 million vehicles by 2010 . Most of this growth will occur in the
developing countries and in Central and Eastern Europe.

<DD>Lead is particularly hazardous to human health, and cars that still rely on leaded gasoline account for up to 95 percent
of airborne lead pollution in cities in developing countries . The World Bank projects that under an "unchanged
practices" scenario, lead emissions could increase fivefold from 1990 to 2030 . Even with efficiency reforms and
pollution abatement measures, lead emissions would not disappear until after 2010 .

<DD>For many cities in developing countries, such as Cairo and Bangkok, ambient lead levels of 1.5 micrograms per cubic
meter are common . In contrast, lead levels typically range from 0.2 to 0.8 micrograms per cubic
meter in most North American and European cities . Along roads with high traffic density, lead levels tend to be
especially high . Residents of the numerous informal settlements that are located next to major roads are thus
subject to high levels of exposure.

<DD>Urban air pollution not only impairs human health but also damages crops, vegetation, and man-made structures,
including historic monuments. These effects are more difficult to quantify. However, acid rain and transported air
pollutants from automobiles and heavy industry have contributed to the decline of forest tracts downwind of urban
areas . As is noted above, cities are also among the major contributors to regional and global atmospheric
pollution.

<FONT SIZE=6>Solid and Hazardous Wastes</FONT><BR>

Cities generate tremendous amounts of solid waste, and those amounts increase with income. In cities of the
developing world, an estimated 20 to 50 percent of the solid waste generated remains uncollected, even though up to
one half of local operational expenditures often goes toward waste collection . In Guatemala City, for
instance, just 65 percent of municipal waste is collected; the rest is disposed of in unofficial locations in the
metropolitan region . In low-income or squatter settlements, garbage collection is often nonexistent, either
because these settlements fall outside "official" service areas or because trucks are unable to maneuver along narrow,
unpaved streets. Uncollected domestic waste is the most common cause of blocked urban drainage channels in Asian
cities, increasing the risk of flooding and vectorborne diseases . In some cities, refuse is often mixed with human
excrement, which facilitates the spread of disease, especially among children and wastepickers.

<DD>In most OECD countries, 100 percent of the urban population is serviced by municipal waste collection .
However, with their higher consumption levels, they confront ever-increasing mounds of garbage. Since 1980, the
generation of municipal waste per capita has increased in all OECD countries except Germany . Despite
massive recycling and incineration proj-ects, Tokyo is unable to cope with the more than 22,000 metric tons of garbage
generated each day; as a result, officials are building islands of waste in Tokyo Bay, which threaten both the shipping
and the fishing industry .

<DD>Even if collected, municipal wastes remain a problem in many cities in developing countries. Municipal solid waste
sites often handle both domestic and industrial wastes, including hazardous wastes. Without proper disposal, toxic
chemicals can leach into water supplies. Few data exist on the composition of hazardous waste streams in developing
countries. The OECD has compiled rough estimates of the volumes of industrial and hazardous wastes generated
worldwide, yet no such data exist on their disposal . Effluents from chemical production, pulp and paper
factories, mining industries, and leather and tanning processes are playing an increasing role in environmental
pollution. If current trends are any indication, the volume of toxic heavy metals generated in countries such as China,
India, the Republic of Korea, and Turkey could reach levels comparable to those of France and the United Kingdom
within 15 years .

<DD>The lack of emissions standards or enforcement of regulations in many developing nations compounds pollution
problems. Illegal dumping and improper disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes are common. In addition, industrial
activity in the developing world tends to be concentrated in relatively few locations, often close to city centers .
Three quarters of all Thai factories dealing with hazardous chemicals are located within Bangkok's metropolitan area
and the neighboring provinces. This includes five of Thailand's seven lead smelting plants and more than 90 percent of
its chemical, dry-cell battery, paint, pharmaceutical, and textile manufacturing plants . The concentration of
people close to these industries increases the risks of exposure.

<DD>Exposures can be severe in the case of industrial accidents or dumping. Even so, they tend to be localized, in contrast to
the citywide problems of air and water pollution . The health effects of hazardous wastes remain controversial,
yet are generally believed to pose a far smaller threat than those associated with biological pathogens in the urban
environment . In the developed world, where the most egregious exposures to hazardous wastes have largely been
remedied, concern is mounting about exposures to even minute levels of toxic wastes .

Cities require vast quantities of resources to run--both for urban inhabitants and for the economic activities that are
clustered there. In contrast to rural communities, which are immediately dependent on the land that supports them,
urban communities are rarely confronted with the impacts of their resource consumption-- advanced transportation
networks allow resources to be tapped from distant hinterlands. Rich cities, in particular, draw on resources far from
their boundaries.

EXTRACTION AND DEPLETION OF NATURAL RESOURCES<BR>
The demand for supplies for cities is much greater and more complex than ever before. These supplies range from
such basics as water, fuel, sand, and wood, to minerals such as aluminum and steel, to advanced plastics and synthetic
materials. For instance, urban expansion creates demands for construction materials such as clays, sand, gravel, and
crushed rock to make concrete, cement, and road stone . In Aligarh City, India, approximately 1,000 cubic meters
of soil is brought into the city each day, altering natural drainage channels and increasing the level of flooding of large
areas in the region . In Jakarta, Indonesia, 1.2 million cubic meters of wood, mainly from the nearby rural islands
of Kalimantan and Sumatra, is imported to the metropolitan region each year . The process of resource extraction
can also have negative environmental impacts, altering natural habitats, increasing land degradation, and indirectly
leading to pollution, such as in mining discharges or saline intrusion into aquifers.
<DD>The range of inputs that sustain city life is enormous, and a discussion of all of these inputs is beyond the scope of
this report. However, a discussion of two resources--water and energy-- illustrates how the scale of urban demand can
deplete local resource stores.

<FONT SIZE=6> Energy Resources  </FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=6> Patterns of Energy Use  </FONT><BR>
Urbanization has a profound effect on the amount and type of energy consumed. Along with population growth,
economic development, and industrialization, urbanization is one of the principal forces driving the global increase in
energy demand . Although traditional rural societies rely heavily on human and animal energy and on nearby
wood for fuel, today's urban societies are characterized by their reliance on fossil fuels and electricity. These different
patterns of energy use lead to different environmental impacts.

<DD>In the developing world, per capita energy consumption remains low. For many urban dwellers, especially in smaller
cities in Africa and Asia, a large share of energy needs are still met by biomass fuels . As these countries
urbanize, however, demand for energy increases and traditional, bulky fuels such as wood or charcoal are replaced by
oil and electricity . Energy consumption tends to be greater in urban areas in the developing world as urban
households acquire more appliances, such as irons, televisions, and refrigerators. Urban dwellers are more likely
to travel to work via energy-intensive modes of transportation, and food and other materials consumed in urban areas
must be transported across greater distances . Urban manufacturing and industry are more energy intensive than
traditional farming . Building the urban infrastructure necessary to support the high population densities in cities
requires energy not typically expended in traditional rural settlements .

<DD>By contrast, per capita energy use in urban areas of the developed world tends to be lower than that in rural areas .
Part of the reason is that industries are no longer located strictly in cities, but much has to do with the
efficiencies of scale possible in cities. For example, attached housing and apartment buildings require less energy for
heating and cooling, and mass transit requires less energy than transport by personal car . Far greater amounts of
energy would be required to provide similar services to dispersed rural populations than to concentrated urban
populations.

<FONT SIZE=6> Impacts of Resource Extraction              </FONT><BR>
In the developing world, biomass fuels provide between 25 and 90 percent of domestic energy supplies, especially in
smaller urban centers . Although urban consumption of wood as fuel is neither the primary use for forest
products nor the major cause of forest loss globally, local impacts on nearby forests can be severe. Even in cities with
low levels of per capita consumption of biomass fuels--Bangkok, Thailand, and Manila, Philippines, for example--the
large number of people concentrated in a small area can place considerable total demand on forest resources .

<DD>The growth in demand for wood resources around cities has caused deforestation around some urban centers reaching
100 kilometers and more. In India between 1960 and 1986, the closed forest cover around 18 urban centers decreased
between one fifth and two thirds . In Africa, urban regions are now experiencing rapid rates of deforestation ,
as in the peri-urban region of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, and the subhumid wooded savannah around Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania . Deforestation also contributes to a variety of indirect environmental impacts, including soil
degradation, water siltation, and the loss of indigenous plant and animal species . However, since forests are a
renewable resource, proper management can help mitigate the impacts; indeed, in some cases the scarcity of fuelwood
has led to additional tree planting .

<DD>As a fuel source, charcoal is often preferred over wood because of its compact size. However, pressures on forests
can intensify when urban households switch from wood to charcoal because charcoal is produced at low conversion
efficiencies from wood . In Senegal, for example, charcoal production accounts for the clearing of between
18,000 and 33,000 hectares per year, or between 11 and 20 percent of total estimated annual deforestation . This
percentage of annual deforestation can be attributed primarily to urban resource demands, since in urban areas
charcoal accounts for 91 percent of wood-based fuels compared with 8 percent in the rural areas .

<DD>As cities increase their reliance on fossil fuels and electric power, pressure on surrounding forests decreases but new
problems emerge, often at considerable distances from the city itself. The environmental impacts of, for example, coal
mining and oil and gas drilling and transport can be severe . In Katowice, Poland, for example, local coal mines
are causing water and land degradation. In 1992, Katowice's coal mines discharged more than 4,800 metric tons of
salt into the Vistula River each day, leading to major declines in aquatic life . About 20,000 hectares of land
in the region are degraded (up from 9,500 hectares in 1975) by mining excavations, tunnels, land subsidence, waste
dumps, and flooded areas. Each year, 500 to 600 hectares of additional land is degraded; in 1988, only 74 hectares
was reclaimed .

<FONT SIZE=6>     Water Resources                   </FONT><BR>
Many countries, including those with enormous amounts of available water, face urban water supply problems .
Local water shortages are especially acute in the world's megacities, although they are also appearing in smaller urban
agglomerations such as Dakar, Senegal; Lima, Peru; La Rioja, Spain; and Lucknow, India.

<DD>The growing demand for water, along with poor water resource management and mounting pollution levels,
contributes to water supply problems in and around cities. Although municipal water use accounts for less than one
tenth of the world's overall water use , urbanization increases the per capita demand for water for domestic
purposes. Part of this growth in demand can be attributed to better access to water supplies in cities than in rural
areas. Industrial demand for water also rises. As the number of people in urban areas grows, so does the demand for
food and, hence, for irrigation in agricultural areas close to the city. These pressures can quickly result in demands for
water that surpass local water supplies.

<DD>Poor urban water management practices exacerbate local water shortages. Where water rights are not clearly defined,
users may claim supplies well in excess of their needs to deal with future uncertainties. Water is usually priced much
lower than the actual cost of securing, treating, and distributing it (in part because of government subsidies), leaving
little incentive for households and industries to conserve water. Inefficient water systems are another major source of
water loss. In many cities in the developing world, leaky pipes and illegal connections waste between 20 and 50
percent of public water supplies . In developed countries, aging infrastructure is
contributing to similar problems. In the United Kingdom, as much as 25 percent of all water used may be lost because
of leakage .

<DD>Water scarcity is closely linked to water quality. Freshwater lakes and rivers provide affordable and easily accessible
water, but uncontrolled discharges of domestic sewage and industrial effluents have left many urban rivers heavily
polluted and their water unsafe for use. Consequently, cities must search for water supplies well beyond their
boundaries .

<DD>Other cities rely on groundwater, but many of them are withdrawing water from aquifers faster than natural rates of
replenishment, leading to salinization and subsidence.  Saline intrusion is common in almost all coastal
cities, from Jacksonville, Florida, to Dakar, Senegal, to the Chinese cities of Dalian, Qingdao, Yantai, and Beihai 
. Land subsidence can cause structural damage to buildings and roads and can contribute to urban flooding.
For Bangkok, which overdraws water from its aquifer by a conservative estimate of 0.6 million to 0.8 million cubic
meters per day, the compacting of underlying soils has led to land subsidence ranging from 5 to more than 10
centimeters per year throughout the region . To alleviate this land subsidence, Bangkok would have to reduce its
groundwater extraction rate by at least one half--a formidable challenge because water demand is expected to grow
rapidly in the coming decades .

<DD>Water shortages and conflicts among urban, industrial, and agricultural users may become especially severe in parts
of India, China, and the Middle Eastern nations. Much of sub-Saharan Africa is likely to face similar pressures,
although data for the region are scarce. Already struggling with uneven distribution of water resources and local
water scarcity, the urban populations of these regions are expected to double in less than 25 years .

<DD>In India, total demand for water is projected to nearly double by 2025. Although agriculture will still claim the bulk
of water supplies, demand is growing fastest in the urban and industrial sectors and is projected to climb 135 percent
over the next 40 years . Already in Hyderabad, India, the need for irrigation water during low-flow years is in
direct conflict with the need for water within the city itself. Similar conflicts are emerging in China, where about 300
cities already experience water shortages .

The true impacts of urban activities on natural resources cannot be captured with a media-specific approach--in other
words, looking first at air pollution and then water. Natural resources are linked, so that the degradation of one
resource affects not only the resource itself but also a wider resource base in and around the urban area . In
Tetuoan, Morocco, for instance, peri-urban deforestation not only destroys local habitat but also increases soil
erosion, which in turn leads to heavy siltation in downslope water reservoirs; 50 percent of the Nakhla Reservoir has
already been lost. The construction of new dams to meet urban water demands has in turn reduced river flows,
affecting riverine habitats and wildlife and reducing the capacity of the rivers to process sewage wastes .

<FONT SIZE=6>  INTEGRATED APPROACHES TO PROTECT THE RESOURCE BASE             </FONT><BR>
As the Tetuoan example makes clear, strategies for environmental management need to consider the entire ecosystem
and the range of insults it experiences. Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is one such strategy. Its premise is
that a coastal ecosystem must be considered as a whole, even though it may be subject to an array of dissimilar threats
and under the control of many separate governments. ICZM is also a participatory planning process that seeks to
involve all the affected parties--from city residents, to industries, to the different levels of state and city
governments-- so that the problems at hand and the possible options for addressing them are widely understood and
the choices for action are broadly supported.

<DD>This approach relies on scientific assessments to help define the scope of impacts, the natural tolerances of
ecosystems to stress, and the benefits, costs, and trade-offs of control options. Even after a management choice is
made--perhaps to treat sewage to remove some but not all nutrients--scientific monitoring is used to evaluate the
impact of this action, which may then prompt further action in the next planning cycle. In this way, ICZM evolves as
environmental conditions and the attitudes of the stakeholders change.

<DD>The two profiles presented below provide a more comprehensive view of the variety of impacts that urban areas can
have on coastal ecosystems, from land conversion, to land-based pollution, to urban use effects. The Chesapeake Bay
profile illustrates how an integrated approach to environmental management has begun to pay off. The Hong Kong
profile dramatically illustrates the range and severity of pressures on urban coastal waters and the difficulty of
addressing them in the context of rapid industrial development.

<FONT SIZE=6>   Chesapeake Bay: Regional Mitigation Efforts Bearing Fruit           </FONT><BR>
The effort to reverse the decline of the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States, represents both the
promise and the difficulty of a regional approach to coastal zone management. In 1983, Maryland, Virginia,
Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia--all of which are part of the watershed of the Chesapeake Bay--entered
into a formal partnership with the federal government to restore the Bay, which has suffered serious degradation from
more than 300 years of heavy exploitation and pollution.

<DD>In the years since the Chesapeake Bay Agreement was signed, specific restoration goals have been wedded to a
comprehensive set of actions designed to improve water quality, restore aquatic habitats, regulate development,
restrict overexploitation of the Bay's resources, and develop a monitoring program to check the progress of these
efforts. This Chesapeake Bay Program has resulted in measurable improvements in the Bay's health. The health of the
Bay remains quite threatened, however, and aggressive action is required if the recovery is to continue .

<DD>The Chesapeake Bay is both extensive and ecologically complex. Stretching nearly 322 kilometers in length, with a
shoreline of some 11,263 kilometers , the Bay is fed by 48 major rivers that drain a combined watershed of
165,760 square kilometers. This gives rise to a range of physical environments and salinity regimes as fresh water and
saltwater mix, creating conditions that support more than 2,500 species of plants and animals. The traditional
productivity of the Bay has meant employment to thousands of crabbers, oystermen, and fishers, and has been one of
the main attractions for the Bay region's flourishing tourist industry .

<DD>The productivity of the Bay, however, has been badly compromised by overuse, pollution, and habitat conversion. The
very size of its watershed makes the Chesapeake vulnerable to human activities over a vast area. By far the most
serious threat to the health of the Chesapeake today is the tremendous influx of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus
from both urban and agricultural sources throughout its watershed. Whereas forest previously covered 95 percent of
the watershed, agriculture now accounts for about 30 percent of the land use and is the largest source of nutrient
pollution. Urban development, which covers about 10 percent of the watershed, is close behind as a source of nutrient
pollution and is growing quickly. The situation is worsened by suburban sprawl, which causes the loss of wetlands
and riparian forest cover, both of which, in their natural states, provide important nutrient buffers .

<DD>Damage to the Bay from nutrient pollution became evident in the 1960s and 1970s and provides a classic example of
progressive eutrophication. At first, extensive algal blooms appeared and the Bay's clarity declined. Eutrophication in
turn led to a serious decline in sea grasses and other submerged vegetation, whose loss affected the numerous species
that used the vegetation as habitat. Finally, a buildup of organic matter in the depths led to a progressive decrease in
dissolved oxygen levels in extensive reaches of the Bay, leaving anoxic dead zones along much of the bottom and
stressing many of the organisms in shallower areas .

<DD>In addition to nutrient enrichment, other pressures on the Bay include industrial effluents and urban runoff, which
have left toxic contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and chlorinated hydrocarbons in sediments.
Overharvesting of fish and shellfish resources has contributed to the demise of important species such as striped bass,
oysters, and shad and may currently be stressing the blue crab fishery--the last major commercial fishery in the Bay.
Waterfowl populations have also diminished substantially as shallow water habitats and wetlands have declined.

<DD>In the mid-1970s and 1980s, the U.S. government undertook an extensive research program to sort out the factors
contributing to the Bay's decline. The research revealed the central role of nutrient pollution, providing an essential
basis for developing a recovery plan. Later modeling studies indicated that nutrients would need to be cut some 40
percent from 1985 levels for the Bay to recover. In 1987, this 40 percent reduction goal was officially adopted as a
centerpiece of the Chesapeake Bay Program .

<DD>As it stands today, the Chesapeake Bay Program is the most ambitious attempt at integrated coastal zone management
in the United States. The program grew out of extensive discussion and negotiation among all interested
parties--including state and federal representatives, industries, local governments, environmental and sporting groups,
and private citizens--and now has wide public and private support .

<DD>Achieving that consensus was impressive, considering that more than 1,600 separate communities in three states and
the District of Columbia surround the Bay and its tributaries. A regional executive council coordinates the program,
receiving oversight and direction from a citizen's advisory committee, a scientific and technical advisory committee,
and a committee of local government representatives. State governments and the federal government have lent legal
and financial support as well as enforcement powers and monitoring capabilities .

<DD>Although goals for nutrient reduction and habitat restoration have been set for the Bay as a whole, more detailed
goals have also been developed for each of the 10 major tributaries. The actual actions taken to achieve these goals
vary widely depending on the location and the nature of the local threats. They include efforts to encourage better
methods of farming and timber harvesting throughout the Chesapeake watershed, management of fish and shellfish
harvests, stream revegetation and marshland restoration, regulation and monitoring of toxic releases from industry,
and mitigation of the effects of shoreline development through such means as vegetative buffer zones, setback
requirements, and other zoning restrictions .

<DD>The results to date have been impressive. Phosphorus levels declined 16 percent from 1985 to 1992 through the use
of a combination of bans on phosphorus-containing detergents, upgrades in municipal sewage treatment plants, and
soil erosion controls and nutrient management on agricultural land . Progress in controlling nitrogen levels has
come more slowly, but it is still significant, despite the increasing population in the watershed . These gains in
nutrient control have led to dramatic improvements in the abundance of submerged vegetation, which increased 75
percent from 1978 to 1993 . The striped bass population has rebounded, thanks in part to improved habitat and
strict limits on fishing .

<DD>Even so, a significant effort will be required to meet the goals of a 40 percent reduction in nutrients and a significant
improvement in habitat quality throughout the Bay--especially since the area's population is expected to grow nearly
20 percent over the next 25 years . So far, the Chesapeake Bay Program has proved to be a flexible mechanism
for improving the quality of the Chesapeake Bay, and area leaders are hopeful that the gradual improvement in the
Bay's condition will fire public enthusiasm for the difficult steps ahead .

<FONT SIZE=6>Hong Kong: A Study in Multiple Impacts</FONT><BR>
Pressures on Hong Kong waters are far greater than those on the Chesapeake, and reversing them promises to be even
more difficult. Hong Kong is the most densely populated urban center in the world. The Hong Kong conurbation
consists of several adjacent cities on the Kowloon Peninsula and nearby Hong Kong Island. It is home to 6.1 million
people and more than 200,000 large and small industries whose byproducts flow into two major and several smaller
marine embayments .

<DD>Located in the subtropical climes of the South China Sea, Hong Kong waters once boasted productive coral reefs and
mangrove stands and yielded abundant catches of fish and shellfish. However, extensive reclamation projects along
the Hong Kong shoreline, massive pollution of the harbor areas, and heavy fishing pressures both in nearby coastal
waters and in the more distant waters of the South China Sea have exacted a major toll .

<DD>Because much of the Hong Kong coast is rather steep, reclamation has played a major role in accommodating urban
growth. Filled land now accounts for more than 25 percent of the urban land area, and seawalls armor much of the
reclaimed shore. This has radically altered Hong Kong's shoreline ecology, eliminating most mangroves and reducing
the diversity of shoreline habitat .

<DD>Aside from the direct destruction of intertidal, seabed, and coral communities, extensive reclamation around both
Victoria and Tolo harbors--Hong Kong's two main harbors--has restricted tidal flushing in the harbor areas,
exacerbating the already severe pollution problems there . Construction of new airport and port facilities has
required some 500 million cubic meters of sand fill, most of which has been obtained by suction dredging from
inshore waters. Dredging has stirred up clouds of silt that settle on nearby sea grass beds and coral communities,
significantly reducing their original extent .

<DD>Raw sewage from some 3.6 million people flows into Victoria Harbor, giving rise to severe effects from nutrient
loading. Despite generally good water circulation in the harbor, water quality continues to decline. Fecal coliform
levels from sewage contamination, for instance, are extremely high, and shellfish contaminated with human pathogens
such as salmonellae, shigellas, and hepatitis viruses are common . In 1988, a hepatitis epidemic involving nearly
1,400 people was traced to the consumption of contaminated shellfish . Dissolved oxygen levels have steadily
declined in harbor waters, and some areas where water circulation is poor suffer from permanent or intermittent
anoxic conditions. In nearby Tolo Harbor, a smaller embayment with very restricted flow that receives the effluents of
1 million people, conditions are much worse and anoxic waters are much more extensive .

<DD>Further toxic insult to the harbor areas comes from industrial wastes--solvents, oils, acids, heavy metals, tannery
wastes, and other compounds--most of which have been, until recently, discharged through the sewer system.
Agricultural chemicals and animal wastes from nearby farms also find their way into the waters around Hong Kong.
Shipping traffic is heavy in Victoria Harbor, bringing with it associated hydrocarbon pollution. As a result, the coastal
waters are significantly contaminated with trace metals such as cadmium and organochlorines such as
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT).

<DD>Marine life in Victoria and Tolo harbors has reacted predictably. Severe pollution has resulted in long-term changes in
community structure, species abundance, and species diversity of the bottom- dwelling organisms, intertidal
organisms, coral communities, and fish. Toxic algal blooms, products of the persistent eutrophication also known as
red tides, are common in Tolo Harbor. In 1977, 2 such red tides occurred, but in the peak year of 1988, the number
rose to 38. The incidence has declined somewhat with improvements in wastewater treatment .

<DD>Hong Kong authorities are trying to mitigate these pollution problems in several ways. Already in place are a number
of laws that restrict effluent discharges from industry and ships and that regulate the dumping of dredge spoils and
sewage sludge at sea . Local authorities have constructed a chemical waste treatment plant, and efforts are being
made to collect and process animal wastes as well .

<DD>To address the largest threat to its aquatic environment--sewage-- Hong Kong has launched a three-phase project. The
first phase, now under way, involves reconstruction of urban sewer lines. The second phase will involve construction
of a large sewage treatment facility on a former island in Victoria Harbor. The final phase will be construction of a
marine outfall to transport treated wastes well beyond the harbor waters. Marine experts warn, however, that until the
marine outfall is built--which is not scheduled for another decade or so--excessive nutrient loading from sewage will
continue to degrade Hong Kong's urban waters .

<DD>To better meet the growing environmental challenges, the Hong Kong government is moving toward integrated
coastal zone management. The planning department has issued maps that broadly identify regions where development
should be concentrated and is now compiling a database on the physical and biological characteristics of the coastal
zone for use in future planning efforts .

<DD>At the same time, however, continued expansion of the Hong Kong urban zone threatens to degrade coastal areas to
the east of the urban core where environmental stresses have previously been light. In response, efforts are under way
to establish several marine parks and reserves to afford some protection to these eastern waters, where coral reefs and
other components of the marine community are still healthy .

<DD>To the west, Hong Kong lies adjacent to one of the most rapidly developing areas of China. Chinese authorities have
already commenced port construction, and proposals are in hand for construction of an automobile manufacturing
plant and other heavy industrial facilities in nearby coastal areas. These potential threats give weight to the argument
that regional coastal planning is urgently needed to avoid catastrophic declines in coastal ecosystems not just in Hong
Kong but along the entire southern coast of China .

Many of these same ideas about citizen participation and community mobilization are embodied in the broader
concept of "sustainable cities," which has garnered increasing attention over the past few years--especially but not
exclusively in the developed world. As yet, however, there is little agreement about what constitutes a "sustainable
city" or whether, in fact, such an entity is possible in the narrow sense of the word. A narrow focus on sustainable
cities, for instance, can lead to the idea that cities should only draw on natural resources from within the immediate
region, which seems increasingly at odds with the globalization of the world economy.

<FONT SIZE=6>CITIES AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT       </FONT><BR>
Some commentators have argued persuasively that a more useful framework is to focus instead on the role of cities in
sustainable development . Here, "sustainable development" is defined as meeting the needs of the present
without undermining the resource and ecological base for future generations. This definition is in keeping with that
used in Our Common Future, the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development (also known as
the Brundtland Commission) .

<FONT SIZE=5>
Cities are clearly central to meeting the goals of sustainable development. The majority of the world's population will
soon live in towns and cities. Worldwide, city-based producers and consumers already account for most of the
renewable and nonrenewable resource consumption and waste generation .

Many of the priority actions called for in this report have been focused on the first part of the equation: meeting the
current needs of the urban poor. As previous chapters have made clear, this involves not just providing physical
necessities such as food, fuel, and water but adequate livelihoods and other social, cultural, health, and political needs
as well.

<BR CLEAR=all>
<P>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point2.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>
In wealthier cities, the second part of the equation, sustainable development, assumes increasing importance, and the
priority actions center on reducing both excessive consumption of natural resources and the burden of wastes on the
global environment. Such initiatives include reducing fossil fuel consumption, for example, through energy
conservation and more efficient transportation systems, and reducing the amount of waste through pollution
prevention.

These longer-term ecological concerns are relevant to cities in the developing world as well, for as they grow and
prosper, their consumption of resources and generation of wastes will rise accordingly unless actions are taken now
to promote the efficient use of resources and the minimization of waste . The challenge for all cities is to seek
new management approaches that both provide for the needs of urban residents and protect the environmental
resources on which human life depends.

Affordable and environmentally clean energy sources are essential to the economic growth of developing and
industrialized countries alike. Reliance on current energy systems, primarily based on fossil fuels, contributes to a wide
range of environmental risks and damages. As a result, simple continuation of current trends in energy production and
consumption is unsustainable.

<FONT SIZE=6> Global climate change  </FONT><BR>
WRI's CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION research program identifies the steps needed to realize the transition
to an environmentally sustainable energy regime -- one in which energy services are provided without compromising
human and environmental health and welfare now or in the future.

Among the threats posed by heavy reliance on fossil fuels, global climate change is perhaps the most serious. Not only
is it hard to see and easy to ignore, but finding solutions poses daunting technical, economic, and political challenges.
WRI was one of the first organizations to make global climate change a primary focus of its research. Working with
scientists, economists, and engineers from many institutions, the interdisciplinary staff of the CLIMATE, ENERGY,
AND POLLUTION Program makes available to governments and non-governmental organizations around the world
the best, most reliable information and analyses of the risks and options associated with climate change.

<DD>Anticipating the major problems that will be encountered in reducing greenhouse gas emissions after the year 2000,
WRI's work focuses on long- term trends and their implications for today's policy choices. Our work on energy policy
is guided by two key realizations. The first is that efficiency improvements must be complemented by a shift to
renewable sources of energy. Renewables offer by far the best prospect of supplying energy in an environmentally
sustainable manner. The second is that under present conditions the needed energy transition is likely to be too slow to
minimize the risks from climate change. As a result, strong economic incentives, including environmentally honest
energy pricing, are needed.

<DD>Focusing on renewable options, on new transportation technologies (such as a "green car" designed to run on
renewable energy), and on economic incentives to hasten the energy transition, WRI puts considerable emphasis on
providing the "supply side" answers that must go hand-in-hand with demand reduction.

<FONT SIZE=6>U.S. Sustainability Project</FONT><BR>
Charting a global "Sustainable Development" path requires substantial changes not only in energy production and use,
but also in transportation, industry, agriculture, forestry, and other economic sectors. Yet, we lack a vision of what
sustainability would mean in the United States and how changes in key sectors of the economy may interact. WRI's
Program in CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION has launched an ambitious two-year effort to spotlight the
double-barreled question: "What would a sustainable U.S. look like and how can we speed the transition?" 

<DD>Working with other WRI programs, the Program in CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION is exploring the concept
of sustainability in the United States and investigating its application to several major economic sectors. Building on
in-house research and expertise in other WRI programs, the team will direct an effort to create a vision of a sustainable
America and an understanding of the steps needed to realize this vision. Workshops on sustainability in the United
States will tie in with four sectoral studies that delineate scenarios for a more sustainable future for these sectors and
show how they can be achieved.

<FONT SIZE=6>International Action on Greenhouse Gases</FONT><BR>
Building on its previous studies of energy taxes (and carbon taxes in particular), WRI is now exploring ways to help
ensure that international efforts to reduce greenhouse gases are as cost-effective as possible. In collaboration with the
Program in ECONOMICS AND POPULATION, WRI's CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION Program will
evaluate mechanisms to further the success of the Climate Change Convention, suggesting how to design effective
taxing mechanisms, adjust tax bases in industrialized countries, address the broader international trade implications of
an OECD-wide carbon tax, and design effective international emissions trading strategies and mechanisms for joint
implementation of the Climate Change Convention.

WRI also continues to build bridges between the community of climate scientists and policy-makers and other strategic
audiences. The program is examining the contribution of trace greenhouse gases -- the "fully fluorinated compounds,"
such as perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride (PFCs and SF6) -- and will continue to promote transatlantic
communication and discussion of carbon and energy tax harmonization.

<FONT SIZE=6>The Institutional and Financial Context for an Energy Transformation</FONT><BR>
Too little attention is being paid to the economic and financial incentives needed to induce the major developing
countries to limit the growth in their greenhouse gas emissions after the year 2000. WRI is launching new research on
this topic, based on the premise that a shift in global energy systems toward a more sustainable state will involve a
tremendous capital commitment and a host of institutions at the local, regional, national and international level.
Opportunities for change are created by the emergence of new financial schemes (such as Joint Implementation);
rethinking old institutions (GEF and the World Bank); and the availability of new funds under, for example, the
Climate Change Convention.

<FONT SIZE=6>Deploying Renewable Energy Sources</FONT><BR>
Renewable sources of energy -- such as solar, wind, and biomass -- hold out prospects for energy supplies that are more
secure and environmentally safer than fossil fuels and other alternatives. Building on a 1993 WRI study of policy
reform to promote renewable energy in the United States and a 1994 report on the renewable energy policies of
development assistance institutions, the CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION Program is now undertaking
research in several developing countries to identify policy reforms needed to enhance the role of renewable energy in a
global sustainable energy future. This research highlights the potential benefits of renewable energy use, the barriers
inhibiting such use in developing countries, and the policies needed to scale those barriers.

<FONT SIZE=6>ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF REDUCING EMISSIONS</FONT><BR>
If setting a price tag on the costs of cutting greenhouse gas emissions is difficult, determining the dollar value of the
benefits is even more problematic. The primary benefit of abatement is avoiding the damages associated with global
warming, which include coastal inundation from rising sea levels, disruption of rainfall and therefore water use
patterns, agricultural effects due to heat stress, and ecosystem damage such as loss of biodiversity and habitat
disruption. Other important potential benefits also come from cutting energy-related emissions, however, such as
cleaner air, reduced damage to crops and forests, and less environmental disruption from fossil fuel extraction. These
not only have an economic value but are widely accorded a higher and more urgent priority by many countries and
communities .

<DD>Pricing the damages from additional global warming involves many unknowns, since the actual extent and regional
distribution of the effects are uncertain. Also, although some effects such as property loss or crop damage are
relatively easy to quantify, quantification of damage to environmental amenities such as clean air, functioning
ecosystems, or biodiversity has always been troublesome for economists because these are intangibles not traded in
the market and their value to human welfare has not been quantified. The long-term and uncertain nature of climate
change also complicates the pricing of damages, since many of these damages occur in the future and standard
economic practice involves discounting these to some lesser, present-day value so that they are comparable to benefits
and costs today. The choice of the "discount rate"--the interest rate used to discount the damages--then becomes
crucial in estimating the monetary value of the effects from global warming that future generations will suffer 
.

<DD>Despite these difficulties, a number of studies have tried to price the damages expected from global warming. These
studies generally assume a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration from preindustrial levels,
leading to an average 2.5 degree C warming. Under these conditions, a very limited set of damages has been estimated
at 1 to 1.5 percent of GDP per year in developed countries and 2 to 9 percent of GDP per year in developing
countries, with island nations potentially suffering much higher damages .

<DD>Of course, carbon dioxide concentrations may not stop at a doubling, and warming may continue, in which case
additional damage will occur. In fact, they may rise geometrically as warming proceeds. For example, damages from a
10 degree C rise might reach 6 percent of GDP or more . There is also the risk of a climate catastrophe in which
the global climate regime changes quickly in unforeseen and deleterious ways. In this case, the damage could escalate
rapidly .

<DD>Other benefits--both local and regional--of emissions abatement, including air quality improvements, can be quite
high. For example, one study estimated that the value of air quality benefits in India from freezing emissions at 1990
levels would actually exceed the costs of the freeze. Likewise, studies in Europe and the United States indicate that
such non-climate-related benefits could offset 30 to 100 percent of abatement costs . At least some economists
who have studied the matter believe that taking into account both climate and other benefits of cutting carbon dioxide
and the need to avoid the risk of a climate disaster provide a plausible economic justification for making substantial
investments in emissions abatement.

central, progressivamente mais detalhados. Nos primeiros estudos, predominam os aspectos de planejamento, enquanto
que nos ltimos predominam os detalhes de engenharia de projeto. As etapas de projeto de uma UHE podem ser assim 
definidas:
<DD><LI>  Estudos de inventrio
<DD><LI>  Estudos de viabilidade econmica
<DD><LI>  Projeto bsico
<DD><LI>  Projeto executivo
<DD> Os estudos de inventrio visam  identificao de alternativas de diviso de quedas para o aproveitamento hidreltrico
de uma bacia, bem como a avaliao de seu potencial e custos associados.  importante lembrar que o processo de diviso de
quedas  uma tarefa de difcil execuo, pois cada aproveitamento determinado interfere direta ou indiretamente em outros
aproveitamentos: a avaliao de um aproveitamento implica a avaliao de todos os recursos disponveis na bacia.
<DD> Os estudos de viabilidade econmica so efetuados de forma isolada, ou seja, individualmente para cada aproveitamento.
 nessa etapa que se determina o nmero de unidades geradoras e o cronograma de motorizao da usina.
<DD> No projeto bsico, so realizados, de uma forma mais detalhada e profunda,  estudos topogrficos, geolgicos e geotcnicos.
Estudos hidrolgicos e metereolgicos so realizados tendo por base bancos de dados completos e consistentes.
<DD> O projeto executivo  constitudo por um grande trabalho de engenharia de projeto, pois o detalhamento de cada parte 
do projeto  efetuado  medida que a UHE  construda.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>  As pequenas centrais hidreltricas (PCH's) tm como principal caracterstica uma maior simplicidade na 
sua concepo. Devido a esse fato, as etapas de projeto e de implantao so mais simples. So 3 
as etapas de desenvolvimento do seu projeto:
<DD><LI>  Pr-dimensionamento
<DD><LI>  Dimensionamento
<DD><LI>  Projeto executivo
<DD> Durante os estudos de Pr-dimensionamento ocorre a identificao de locais barrveis, primeiramente 
atravs de mapas e levantamentos aerofotomtricos e, posteriormente atravs de visitas de campo. Atravs de visitas de 
campo pode-se, tambm, coletar dados sobre a flora e fauna locais de forma a se produzir um esboo do estudo da
interferncia nas condis ambientais locais. Nesta etapa  realizada a verificao, in loco, das vazes transpostas
para evitar variaes grandes em bacias prximas em funo da variao do tipo de terreno;  realizada, tambm,  uma avaliao
precisa do traado da eventual linha de transmisso local que, devido ao pequeno porte da obra de uma PCH, pode elevar
 sensivelmente o custo total da central.
<DD>   Os estudos de dimensionamento compreendem uma srie de procedimentos que visam ao dimensionamento
hidrulico das instalaes e a elaborao das especificaes bsicas dos equipamentos hidromecnicos e eltricos.
Deve-se, nesta etapa, levantar a topografia do stio em questo de forma detalhada, estudar a fundo as caractersticas
hidroenergticas e ambientais do aproveitamento, determinar o nmero timo de mquinas a ser instalado face s caractersticas
do mercado a ser atendido e calcular a expectativa de gerao de energia secundria, bem como sua energia firme.
<DD> O projeto executivo de uma PCH compreende levantamentos mercadolgicos, ambientais, geolgicos, geotcnicos, 
topogrficos e hidrolgicos detalhados.

<FONT SIZE=6>PCH's: Vantagens</FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5> Pode-se citar como vantagens das PCH's:
<DD><LI>  uma fonte de energia no poluente
<DD><LI>  uma fonte de energia eltrica que no consome combustvel, 
utilizando um recurso renovvel mantido pelo ciclo
hidrolgico
<DD><LI> Permitem uma melhor distribuio geogrfica dos investimentos
<DD><LI> Proporciona meios para o desenvolvimento scio-econmico regional
<DD><LI> So investimentos com curtos prazos de maturao, ou seja, 
so obras para serem implantadas no mximo em 24 meses
<DD><LI>  uma fonte de energia caracterizada por confiabilidade e flexibilidade de operao, incluindo rpida entrada no
sistema e rpida retirada do sistema. Dessa maneira, a PCH se torna uma parte importante de um sistema eltrico que possui
rpidas mudanas em termos de demanda, melhorando a eficincia e otimizando a economia do sistema.
<DD><LI> Propiciam mercado para pequenas empresas nacionais nas reas de projeto, fabricao e montagem de equipamentos

<DD> A parcela do mercado ocupada por estas pequenas empresas, por sua vez, proporciona um vasto campo para atuao de
entidades de pesquisa. Estes produtos e tecnologias apresentam um importante potencial de mercado externo na Amrica Latina
onde instituies como a OLADE e o BID vm incentivando o emprego de PCH's.

<DD><LI> O fluxo normal do rio  interrompido. A gua se torna estratificada, com a gua
mais quente na superfcie e a mais fria no fundo. Dessa maneira, a gua do fundo 
fica muito pouco oxigenada, matando muitas espcies de peixes.
<DD><LI>O problema crucial de uma PCH  a alterao da hidrologia do rio que, por sua

<FONT SIZE=5>A partir de meados da dcada de 80, o Estado Brasileiro se viu na iminncia de uma reduo drstica dos 
investimentos no setor eltrico. Apesar da responsabilidade de gerao de energia eltrica ser atribuda ao Estado, o mesmo
no se apresentava com capacidade de investimento suficiente para suprir a demanda de energia prevista para a segunda metade 
dos anos 90.
<DD> Assim, o DNAEE, atravs da portaria MME 025 (1988), iniciou o processo de atrao de capital privado para a 
gerao de energia eltrica, sobretudo atravs de PCH's. Entretanto, as condies exigidas e os longos perodos de 
amortizao dos investimentos se tornaram um empecilho  concretizao dos empreendimentos, de forma que, apesar
dos esforos do Governo Federal, aps 4 anos de existncia do decreto, NENHUM dos aproveitamentos licitados se 
concretizou.
<DD>A participao da iniciativa privada exige como contrapartida o retorno do capital investido a um risco calculado e 
aceitvel, o que, at o momento (1994), no tem sido percebido pelo setor pblico. Desta forma, fica o setor, mais uma vez,
  espera de uma crise generalizada para se obter uma nova soluo para os problemas que se acumulam.
<DD> importante salientar que a iniciativa privada trabalha em um regime de economia de mercado e que, portanto, os
custos do suprimento em uma poca de crise sero elevados e revestidos de um alto faturamento. Isto leva o setor
a uma posio de saque, o que no propicia o desenvolvimento adequado da economia nacional.

Vrias atitudes poderiam ser tomadas para se adotar uma poltica favorvel ao desenvolvimento de empreendimentos no setor
eltrico como, por exemplo, desenvolver estudos visando  reduo do perodo de concesso e, consequentemente, do perodo de depreciao
das instalaes dos equipamentos de modo a permitir uma melhoria no perfil econmico do empreendimento. Findo o perodo
de concesso, a usina retornaria ao Estado e seria novamente licitada, permitindo uma justa remunerao do capital com base nas 
regras de mercado.
<DD> Dessa forma, o setor estar aberto ao investidor privado, que poder participar do mercado sem colocar em risco
o papel social que vem sendo desenvolvido pelo estado nas ltimas dcadas.

A partir de 1988, o DNAEE lanou uma srie de concorrncias pblicas para o fornecimento de energia a regies eletricamente isoladas
. Foi a primeira tentativa recente para se abrir o setor de gerao de energia eltrica, destacando-se o importante papel das PCH's
para suprimento pblico. Entretanto as normas no se preocuparam com as garantias de financiamento do capital e nem com
o tempo de retorno deste. Com isto, a maior parte dos editais deixou de ser vista com seriedade: as concorrncias lanadas
se constituiram em fracasso pois, apesar de terem um razovel nmero de interessados, no surgiu nenhum empreendedor
com coragem para arriscar os seus bens e recursos em uma atividade considerada de alto risco e baixo retorno. Dessa maneira,
 mais conveniente se forar uma situao de desabastecimento, com as respectivas implicaes polticas, do que se arriscar
numa aventura onde no se tem controle do preo do produto e nem do custo dos recursos demandados para a implantao do
empreendimento.

<FONT SIZE=6> Concorrncias Pblicas     </FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>
Devido  gravidade da crise institucional e financeira que o Setor Eltrico Brasileiro atravessa e ao crescente consumo de 
energia eltrica, vislumbra-se a mdio prazo um cenrio de desabastecimento de energia eltrica no pas. As regies mais
desenvolvidas e eletricamente interligadas necessitam, obrigatoriamente, de grandes blocos de energia que, para serem
instalados, demandam grande quantidade de recursos que so, atualmente, de financiamento quase impossvel.
<DD>Se, por um lado existe um mercado sempre crescente, possibilitando a viabilizao dos investimentos necessrios
nos sistemas interligados, o mesmo no ocorre nos pequenos sistemas isolados do interior do Brasil. Nesses, as grandes
distncias das centrais geradoras e a baixa demanda inviabilizam qualquer esforo para promover a sua interligao e
 o seu conseqente abastecimento de forma convencional. Devido a esse fato, os mesmos so hoje operados como pequenos
sistemas isolados, com centrais termeltricas a leo diesel, que, alm do elevado custo operacional, ainda apresentam,
como inconveniente adicional, a avanada idade dos grupos, o que obriga, em certos casos,  "canibalizao" de algumas 
centrais.
<DD>A urgncia da situao levou o Governo Federal, atravs do Ministrio das Minas de Energia, a iniciar um processo
no sentido de atrair a participao da iniciativa privada para o setor de gerao e distribuio de energia eltrica. A utilizao
de capital privado, preferencialmente REGIONAL, adequado s exigncias e necessidades locais, em conjunto com o setor
pblico, sem se ater  mera privatizao do setor,  uma boa proposta para a grave crise que se esboa no cenrio nacional.
<DD> Em um quadro j no muito favorvel, foram iniciadas em 1988, as concorrncias para o suprimento de energia eltrica
de origem HIDRULICA para sistemas isolados. Para habilitar a participao nas concorrncias, o DNAEE cadastrou
empresas majoritariamente privadas que, aps a anlise de sua situao, foram consideradas aptas a participarem
de concorrncias pblicas. Cada edital de concorrncia devia ser acompanhado de uma estimativa de mercado e de um valor
limite no preo da energia a ser comprada pela concessionria local. Essas concorrncias contaram com o apoio das empresas
concessionrias de energia eltrica locais que, dentro de suas possibilidades, incentivaram e apoiaram os servios de 
investigao preliminar. A forma de avaliao das propostas tem se mostrado deficitria, ocasionando que o vencedor da
proposta no venha  a cumpr-la, acarretando um nus de difcil avaliao  sociedade.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>

Para avaliao das propostas apresentadas, o DNAEE utiliza os seguintes indicadores:
<DD><LI>Preo e quantidade da energia fornecida
<DD><LI>Prazo para incio da operao da central
<DD><LI>Regularidade do suprimento
<DD> A combinao desses indicadores permite o julgamento das propostas, vencendo aquela que apresentar o menor valor
anual de energia.
<DD>O preo da energia eltrica nas concorrncias pblicas abertas pelo DNAEE  calculado considerando-se que o mercado
de energia eltrica em disputa dever ser atendido preferencialmente, em quase toda sua totalidade, por energia de origem
hidrulica. No caso de ser oferecida apenas uma parcela de energia necessria, a complementao fica a cargo da concessionria
local, atravs de energia de origem trmica.

Em virtude da situao  em que se encontram as licitaes promovidas pelo DNAEE para a construo de PCH's pela iniciativa privada,
visando ao atendimento de sistemas eletricamente isolados, torna-se necessrio reavaliar os procedimentos e normas, uma vez
que estes no tem permitido a viabilizao das obras licitadas. Algumas propostas tem surgido:
 <DD><LI> a execuo dos estudos de pr dimensionamento, com a criao de bancos de dados hidrolgicos, geolgicos e 
topogrficos, e o dimensionamento das PCH's sejam efetuados pela concessionria local com a eventual assistncia do DNAEE
 e de eventuais consultoras e universidades, deixando-se para a empresa vencedora da licitao somente o projeto executivo da
 planta;
<DD><LI>as concessionrias devem ser devidamente ressarcidas, pelo vencedor da concorrncia, pelos custos envolvidos na
elaborao dos estudos  de pr dimensionamento e do dimensionamento. As concessionrias deveriam, ainda, utilizar esses
recursos para a execuo de um plano de fornecimento de energia eltrica atravs de PCH's isoladas que possuam, como
caracterstica PRINCIPAL o seu AUTO FINANCIAMENTO.
<DD>A aplicao desta sistemtica e a subseqente licitao das obras permitir ao DNAEE e  concessionria local
avaliar a melhor proposta com menor risco, uma vez que a qualidade tcnica dos projetos concorrentes ser teoricamente
a mesma.
<DD>A viabilizao da participao da iniciativa privada na construo de PCH's para suprimento pblico no pas passa tambm
pela criao de uma lei de garantias que permitam ao investidor avaliar a seriedade do programa, apesar da inconstncia

(para pequenos centros) e industrial (para reas isoladas), atravs da ampliao da oferta de energia eltrica, insumo bsico
para o desenvolvimento do pas. As PCE's podero, tambm, contribuir de forma efetiva para a reduo do consumo de derivados
de petrleo empregados na gerao eltrica, principalmente em localidades isoladas da regio Norte.
<DD>A ELETROBRS participou, entre 1981 e 1982, da elaborao do Manual de PCH's juntamente com o DNAEE.
<DD>Posteriormente, foi elaborada uma proposta de ao governamental em termos de um Programa Nacional de Pequenas
Centrais Hidreltricas, aprovado pelo ministrio de Minas de Energia em meados de 1984.
<DD>Mais recentemente, no incio de 1995, o grupo de trabalho criado pela Portaria DNAEE 776/94, concluiu que: "  
<B>inquestionavelmente oportuno</B> o lanamento de um novo Programa Nacional de PCH's".
<DD>O PNCE est sendo proposto com o objetivo de dinamizar a implantao de pequenos empreendimentos para a 
expanso da oferta de energia eltrica a mercados atendidos ou no por concessionrias, estimulando uma maior participao
de autoprodutores e produtores independentes, consequentemente propiciando um programa alternativo para a complementao
do plano de expanso da gerao. O programa prev, ainda, a possibilidade de concessionrias de servio pblico participarem de
investimentos em PCE's atravs de associaes de empresas em forma de consrcio ou isoladamente.
<DD>So objetivos  deste PNCE as centrais eltricas com potncia igual ou inferior a 10 MW: PCH's, Pequenas Centrais
Trmicas (incluindo consumidores industriais que geram vapor de processo), fontes no convencionais (elica, resduos
agroindustriais, sistemas hbridos).
<DD>A natureza bsica do programa  tratar os novos empreendimentos, envolvendo a construo de PCE's como oportunidades de 
negcios, para os quais devem ser estimulados, sobretudo, os produtores independentes e os autoprodutores.
<DD>A ELETROBRS atuar, numa primeira instncia, empenhando-se na identificao e viabilizao de negcios; isto
implica tanto na proviso de informaes que evidenciem, para a iniciativa privada, as condies do negcio em termos de
investimentos necessrios, rentabilidade, fontes de financiamento e mercado a ser atendido. 
<DD>A ELETROBRS criar e apoiar tecnicamente o programa, atuando junto a investidores, fabricantes de equipamentos, 
projetistas, construtores e operadores dessas instalaes e junto ao DNAEE, nos processos licitatrios para efeito de outorga

<FONT SIZE=6>Consumo de gua</FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5> Segundo dados do IBGE (1991), mais de 90% do volume de esgotos domsticos e 70% do volume 
de efluentes industriais so lanados sem tratamento nos rios. Em So Paulo, em muitos casos j no  possvel 
a utilizao de tcnicas convencionais de tratamento das guas dos rios para abastecimento.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5>   As indstrias de ao, papel e as usinas produtoras de lcool so os setores que mais utilizam
gua da Bacia dos rios Piracicaba e Capivari. Para obteno dos respectivos produtos, so necessrios os seguintes volumes de 
gua:
<DD><LI>Cada litro de lcool produzido necessita de  150 litros de gua ou mais 
<DD><LI>Cada quilo de papel produzido necessita de  at 500 litros de gua 
<DD><LI>Cada quilo de ao produzido necessita de 600 litros de gua.
<DD> A captao de guas pela indstria, nessa bacia,  de 14328 l/s (dados de 1992). Desse total, cerca de 11925 l/s retornam
aos rios sob forma de efluentes. A gua perdida no volta mais  bacia hidrogrfica de origem; ela foi incorporada ao produto industrial
ou simplesmente perdida no ar e no solo.

<FONT SIZE=5> Mas as perdas no so decorrentes somente do uso industrial: o uso no abastecimento pblico e na
agricultura tambm contribui para a reduo da vazo natural dos rios.  Alguns exemplos desses usos so
<DD><LI> irrigao
<DD><LI> reverso entre bacias hidrogrficas: este  o componente mais violento da reduo da vazo de um rio. Desta forma,
pela transferncia de um rio para outro, o primeiro ir ficar privado de gua e o segundo ir receber gua e dejetos que no
fazem parte do seu fluxo natural.

<FONT SIZE=6>Exportao de gua e Perdas</FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>
   O consumo total de gua nos municpios  das bacias dos rios Piracicaba e Capivari  cerca de 
14 000 l/s.
 H uma ntima relao entre as bacias do rio Piracicaba e Capivari e a bacia do rio Jundia e a bacia
do Alto Tiet, onde se situa a Regio Metropolitana de So Paulo. As bacias dos rios  Piracicaba e Capivari exportam
gua para as cidades de Jundia e grande So Paulo. Esta gua  exportada e no volta mais, nem na forma de esgoto.
Os seguintes volumes so  exportados:
<DD><LI>1,2 metros cbicos por segundo - Jundia
<DD><LI>33,0 metros cbicos por segundo - Grande So Paulo
<DD> Campinas utiliza 3 metros cbicos por segundo para abastecimento pblico, o que mostra que o volume exportado  
bastante significativo.
 O atendimento da Bacia (dados de 1993)
gira em torno de 13 000 000  pessoas.
<DD>Estima-se que 40% da gua captada nos rios no chega  residncias, ou no chegam a ser cobrados
pelos responsveis pelo servio (bacia dos rios Piracicaba e Capivari, 1993). Na Alemanha, o nvel  apenas de 10%. Nveis de
20% seriam aceitveis para a regio.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>
 Para organizar todo o sistema de fornecimento de gua, a soluo que tem sido apontada em
primeiro lugar  a de tirar os departamentos e servios de gua e esgoto da situao em que se encontram. A organizao do servio
pblico na regio se d em 4 tipos de formas jurdicas:
<DD><LI> Empresa do tipo sociedade annima, com capital predominante pblico e da prefeitura
<DD><LI> Secretaria ou departamento, rgo da administrao direta da prefeitura
<DD><LI> Departamento ou servio autnomo de gua e esgoto  na forma de autarquia descentralizada
<DD><LI> SABESP - sociedade annima de capital predominante do Governo do estado de So Paulo que, atravs de 
contratos e cocesso a longo prazo, atende aos municpios da regio.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=60 SRC="photo/point1.gif"></IMG>
<FONT SIZE=5>  Um dos critrios possveis para a cobrana  calcular os custos das obras necessrias para recuperar
o meio ambiente e ratear o total entre todos os usurios. A proposta  cobrar tarifa , no s pelo transporte da gua como
se faz hoje em alguns lugares, mas tambm pela poluio e pela escassez do produto.   </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5> Antes de regulamentar o uso no mbito estadual  preciso superar as dificuldades de ordem legal,
pois a Constituio atribui  Unio a competncia de legislar sobre as guas. O estado de So Paulo tem tem sua lei
(nmero 7.663/91) considerando a gua "bem pblico de valor econmico cuja utilizao deve ser cobrada".   </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5>  Os Consrcios de Bacias desempenham um papel fundamental na luta pela regulamentao
do uso da gua. So doze unidades no estado, a cada uma correspondendo uma Agncia de Bacias. s agncias
caber gerenciar os recursos arrecadados e as obras de despoluio dos cursos d'gua. Na elaborao do projeto 
que o governador est enviando para o poder Legislativo, pesaram muito os estudos iniciais do CONSRCIO DAS BACIAS 
DOS RIOS PIRACICABA E CAPIVARI, regio que abrange cidades do porte de Campinas e Jundia.  </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5>   Um dos fatores que dificulta ainda mais a organizao dos servios  o fato de cada municpio possuir
uma tarifa. A tarifa  fixada, na maioria dos casos, sem critrios e sem uma poltica definida. Em funo das tarifas inadequadas,
ou faltam recursos, ou estes ficam dependentes do oramento municipal. Sem independncia gerencial, os servios de gua e esgoto
fazem o mnimo necessrio para as cidades funcionarem. As tarifas so to dspares, que a SABESP chega a cobrar US$ 1,3
por cada 1000 l de gua tratada fornecida a uma residncia de padro mdio, enquanto que em Americana, a mesma tarifa  4
vezes menor.  </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=5> Em pases do primeiro mundo, como a Frana, j se cobra pela gua e pela poluio e se utiliza
os recursos arrecadados para obras de saneamento. A Frana aprendeu a gerenciar o uso da gua, criou um parlamento da 
gua de que participam representantes da comunidade, de instituies pblicas e privadas, e estabeleceu uma taxa a ser paga 
tambm pelas indstrias que retiram gua dos rios.   </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=6>Mercado de PCH's: Caractersticas de PCH's  </FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>
<DD><LI>Potncia de at 10 MW
<DD><LI>Reservatrio: geralmente inexistente ou de regularizao diria
<DD><LI>CUSTOS: especficos para cada aproveitamento (geralmente superiores a US$ 1500 por kW). No h economias
de escala sensveis
<DD><LI>Porte da obra: empreendimentos na faixa de  US$ 5 a 20 milhes <BR>
Finalidades do aproveitamento: <BR>
<DD><LI>1) servio pblico em locais isolados ou em locais com particulares problemas  de suprimento fornecimento de energia
<DD><LI>2) produo independente
<DD><LI>3) autoproduo
 fundamental notar que a UHE de pequeno porte (para no se impor nenhuma classificao) tem enorme mercado na 
produo independente de energia, em particular, usinas da ordem de 20 a 70 MW.  fundamental notar, tambm, que
essas usinas devem ser construdas e operadas na filosofia simplificada das PCH's.
<DD> Ento, o prprio conceito de PCH de at 10 MW deve ser revisto. Esse conceito nasceu de uma conjuntura poltica e
econmica da poca em que foi criado, sem parmetros  permanentes e, portanto,  extremamente oportuno rev-lo.
Naquela poca havia turbinas turbinas construdas no pas de at 5 MW. Devido  conjuntura econmico-poltica da 
poca, adotou-se ter, no mximo, 2 turbinas deste prote em cada aproveitamento.
<DD> Poder-se-ia formular um novo conceito de PCH's dentro da seguinte filosofia: PCH  uma usina construda e operada
por investidores privados, com critrios simples, na busca de maior flexibilidade e rentabilidade do que nas obras tradicionais
do setor. No h necessidade alguma de se manter uma classificao burocrtica da PCH, pois isso no traz vantagem alguma
hoje em dia (1996).

Existe tecnologia para diminuir as perdas no uso da gua e encontrar padres eficientes para o uso domstico
e industrial. Reciclagem de gua certamente aumentar a eficincia no uso da gua nas prximas dcadas em vrias reas.
Embora o preconceito da populao seja ainda uma barreira para o uso de gua reciclada para beber, a reciclagem
em outros usos est cada vez mais comum. A Califrnia, lder consumidor de gua reciclada nos EUA, usa cerca de 
 325 000 acre-feet de gua reciclada anualmente para refrigerao em indstrias, barreiras contra invaso de 
gua salgada e irrigao.

<DD>Num sistema de usinas hidreltricas, gua deve ser alocada
pelas unidades geradoras em intervalos de tempo que permitam cada unidade ser operada
com mximo rendimento para a respectiva queda (H). A  eletricidade requerida 
pelo sistema  gerada por um conjunto de unidades, de modo a ocorrer
revezamento entre os tempos de operao de cada unidade. Isto maximiza  a eficincia
do gerenciamento da energia hidrulica que pode ser obtida da quantidade de
gua disponvel.

You can email us by selecting the <I><B><A HREF="mailto:mdangus@psychtest.com">mdangus@psychtest.com</A></B></I> link on any of our pages.<P>
This site currently runs to about 1.5 megabytes. The <A HREF="catcont.htm">Resource Book</A> which is the largest part of the site, is a set of HTML files generated from the test database maintained by M.D. Angus & Associates Ltd. A printed copy of <EM>The Testing Materials Resource Book</EM> is available free of charge in Canada ($5.00 prepaid on Mastercard is currently required for international shipments). The printed  Resource Book will never be as current as this on line edition.<P><H4>How to use this site:</H4><P>
The easiest way to locate a specific test is to select the Catalog icon on this page. This link takes you to the Test Catalog contents file. From the contents file you can do a text search using your browser for the test name, or to use the contents file links to quickly locate the test by subject.<P>
If you want to participate in test development in progress, select the Research Department link on this page. You will be presented with descriptions of test item pools under development, and will be offered a chance to contribute an item by emailing it to us. 
<H4>About this site:</H4><P>
Development of this site was initiated in March of 1996. We came to believe that our role as providers of information to the general public and to our colleagues could be filled effectively using the internet. In addition, we believe that there are many other areas of our business that may be adapted to the internet in the near future. Your comments and assistance in this regard will be invaluable. Please let us know what you think of the site. Email us your ideas. A site like this will only work if it is a collaborative effort between us and the people who use the site.<P>
Some parts of the site are still very rough, and require polishing up. We would very much appreciate any comments about typographical or other errors like broken links which you find. To return to this start page from a child page you may select one of the <a HREF="index.html"> M.D. Angus&amp; Associates Ltd.</a> links which occur on every page in this web site.<P>

Some basic information about testing and a great deal of information about the specific job you wish to hire an employee to do is required. If you have this knowledge, then you may be the best person to develop your own testing program. We may be able to help, once you have identified some basic objectives for your program, by suggesting commonly used tests which will rank individuals based on the objectives you have identified. There is no charge for this type of consultation.<P>
If you do not feel comfortable with your knowledge of standardized assessment, or feel that you need some hand-holding until you are comfortable with assessment procedures, we may be able to consult with you for a fee or refer you to another consultant who will be able to assist you. We work closely with several very good independent professionals who have a full-time practice in program evaluation or in pre-employment evaluation.<P> <H2>What services do we offer?</H2><H3>A source of commercially published standardized tests</H3><P><P>We offer a one-stop source from which to purchase the testing materials of over one hundred different publishers. Our remuneration comes from the sale of tests. There is no charge for telephone/fax/email consultation about tests.<H3>Test consultation via phone/fax/email</H3><P>As with other technical publications (like computer software), often purchasers face many competing products that will do the same job. Some are better than others, some are adequate but much more expensive than competing products of roughly the same quality. A knowledgable test consultant can make the job, of deciding which tests to use, manageable.<P>We consult with professionals as to which tests may be appropriate for their use. Our test consultants are familiar with most of the titles which we list in our catalog. If you want to know about a current test which is in general use, it is likely that the test consultant will be able to help immediately from his/her own knowledge. In addition, test consultants have access to sources of reference information which may only be available to you if you were to go to a university library. <H3>Testing program development</H3><P>Businesses that want a professionally developed testing program, for pre-employment evaluation or for any other purpose, can obtain more in depth advice by hiring a consultant from our firm or by asking us for a referral to another qualified professional.<P>A test consultant can be expected to visit your site and devise an assessment system for program evaluation, employee evaluation, pre-employment selection, etc. Evaluation systems developed by our consultants will include...<UL><LI src=bullet.gif>a written report in the form of a program manual</LI><LI src=bullet.gif>training so that your personnel will be able to operate the program independently</LI><LI src=bullet.gif>security, in that a consultant who is knowledgable about your situation and your evaluation system will always be available to assist you should any questions arise. Moreover, knowledge of your selection procedure will not be lost to your firm when a key employee leaves -- because we will have your testing program on file.</LI></UL>Typically, fees for this type of consulting service are billed at an hourly rate of $125/hour or $900/day (Canadian dollars), plus expenses.<P>If, due to time constraints, we cannot help as immediately as you would like, we will refer you to another competent professional or to a professional association that may have an experienced member practicing in your region.<H3>What we do not offer.</H3><p>Certain (few) tests are <A HREF="WhatAreR.html">restricted</A>. We do not provide restricted tests to people who are not qualified to obtain them.<P>
With reference to designing a testing program and training people to use tests -- it is not possible to provide the same quality of service over the phone as a consultant can provide in person. If we feel that a consultant must visit your site and that you will need training about how tests work, what test objectives are, etc. -- we will quote a price for designing a program, and/or we will refer you to another appropriate source of assistance. For more information please see the articles <A HREF="WhatAreS.html">What Are Standardized Tests</A> and <A HREF="WhatAreR.html">What are Restricted Tests</A>.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle><P>Copyright &#169 1996,<A HREF="frontpge.htm"> M.D. Angus & Associates Ltd.</A><P><A HREF="mailto:mdangus@psychtest.com">mdangus@psychtest.com</A><P><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<TITLE>What Are Restricted Tests</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor=white><bgsound src="sound.mid" LOOP=infinite><CENTER><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle><H1>What Are Restricted Tests</H1><IMG SRC="bar1.gif" ALIGN=middle></CENTER><P>Restricted tests may not be purchased by an individual unless (s)he  possesses certain credentials. Tests are generally grouped into 3 restriction categories...<OL COMPACT><LI>Tests which anyone may purchase who has a knowledge of how tests may be used... known as <EM>level A, category 1, or level 1</EM> tests.<LI>Tests where some formal experience and knowledge of testing is required. The publisher requires that the test purchaser has a level of knowledge sufficient to use the test before allowing sale... known as<EM> level B, category 2, or level 2</EM> tests.<LI>Tests which are restricted for sale only to members of a professional association which certifies the individual is licensed to practice psychology or psychiatry... known as<EM> level C, category 3, or level 3</EM> tests. </OL><H1>What Does This mean?</H1><P>It means one can only buy tests which may be useful in conducting legitimate business. The restrictions listed above will not normally prevent anybody from obtaining any test which could be used effectively. <H2>Level 1 tests </H2><P>Users of level 1 tests should know as much about tests as is contained in this article, and must have a work related reason for obtaining the test. This may include teaching or research in the field of psychology at a college or university. Note: we do not sell tests directly to students -- only to instructors/supervisors who are expected to be responsible for the proper handling of the tests by their students.<H2>Level 2 tests </H2><P>Users of level 2 tests must meet the criteria for level 1 and must in addition meet the requirements of the publisher as regards elegibility for the specific test. The requirements are seldom much different from those for level 1.<H2>Level 3 tests </H2><P>Level 3 tests are restricted to use by professional psychologists, psychiatrists, or those with a similar suitable designation. Level 3 tests include those which are useful in the assessment of psychopathology. These tests often require careful interpretation. Frequently, useful results can only be obtained by people with training in the use of the specific test. If you are curious about this type of test, we suggest that much more can be learned about testing and about psychology from texts which are freely available in every library, and from courses taught in colleges and universities, than can be learned from a copies of tests.<H1>Why Restrict Tests</H1><P>If individuals are to be given tests for any reason, and if the test's validity relies on these individuals not having seen the test prior to administration, then it is evident that such tests must not be given out to general circulation. This is more important for <A HREF="WhatAreS.html">standardized tests</A> than it is of the final exam on which a teacher will base student grades. Since <A HREF="WhatAreS.html">standardized tests</A> can only be developed at great expense -- through specialized knowledge and extensive research -- it becomes much more important that knowledge of test content be safeguarded from the general public.<P>From the above one can see that test publishers find themselves in a somewhat paradoxical position. They make their money by selling copies of tests, however, they cannot generally distribute tests without destroying the utility of (and future sales of) their product. To ensure that a test will continue to be useful, publishers classify their standardized test products according to who may purchase them. Publishers expect that users will not destroy a test that is purchased by showing it to people unnecessarily. Test purchasers are expected to keep tests under lock and key, and to see that all copies of tests are destroyed when they are no longer required. This expectation is not to be confused with the legal <A HREF="WhatCopy.html">copyright</A> under which test purchasers must buy copies of tests from the publisher rather than reproduce them locally.<H2>Psychology and Restricted tests</H2><P>No group relies on the availability and validity of standardized tests more than professional psychologists. Early on, the American Psychological Association (APA) developed guidelines for the handling and use of testing materials. APA guidelines were set out to assist members in understanding the proper handling of tests. Other ethical guidelines protect the public and protect the reputation of the profession. These ethical principles indicated that members must limit themselves to areas of practice in which they held an acceptable level of experience and competence. Thus tests used by psychologists are doubly protected because the publishers will only sell to psychologists, and the psychologists are bound by regulations of their professional association not to engage in behavior that would destroy the validity of the tests.<P>Most provinces in Canada and U.S. States have Professional Psychologists Associations, and most of these associations  have produced their own version of the APA guidelines and have a body of regulations which govern ethical conduct. Most of these associations have some sort of a web page. Although we do not list each state organization on our <A HREF="WWLinks.html">Web Links page</A>
, from our links page you can jump to the APA or CPA page and from there you can find good lists of links to state or provicial psychological associations. All of these associations have staff or volunteers who would be glad to provide information about any aspect of the practice of psychology in your region.<CENTER><IMG SRC="bar1.gif" ALIGN=middle><P>Copyright &#169 1996,<A HREF="frontpge.htm"> M.D. Angus & Associates Ltd.</A><P><A HREF="mailto:mdangus@psychtest.com">mdangus@psychtest.com</A><P><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
