<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>The EOC Concept</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3><HR></H3><H2>The EOC Concept</H2><H3><HR></H3><BR><B><I>David L B Jupp</I></B><BR><BR>The formation of the Earth Observation Centre (EOC) is a very welcome development.It is a concept that, in various forms, has been proposed and suggestedoften in CSIRO over the last 15 years but has always eventually fallen onbarren ground. The Simpson Report provided a catalyst for an EOC to finallycome into being. However, the EOC would not have progressed to its presentpoint if there were not an underlying and widely accepted desire to seesomething of this form develop. I believe that the desire existed beforethe Report was commissioned and involves much more than the data collection,storage and communication focus of MDP-19. Not withstanding this desire,the EOC can still be difficult to maintain. This will occur unless thereis a continuing level of strong commitment and support from the Organisationand from the individuals on whose skill and proud accomplishments its futuresuccess rests. Equally, with such support and commitment it cannot fail.<BR><BR>Over those same 15 years there have developed strong centres of remote sensingexpertise in CSIRO. These have mostly had an applications focus and beenlocated in a range of different industry oriented Divisions. Decentralisationhas certainly lead to some of the difficulties listed in the Simpson Report.However, on the positive side, the period has seen remote sensing sciencein CSIRO develop soundly and productively in support of well defined applicationareas. These include atmospheric sciences, fisheries and oceans, water resources,mineral and geophysical exploration, soil survey, forestry and agriculturalapplications. The integration of the remote sensing scientists with appliedDivisions has been very fruitful in a way that their separation into a singledisciplinary Unit in the past may not have been. Australia has become verywell known for its application oriented combination of remote sensing scienceand real world applications.<BR><BR>There has also developed strong support for a science focussed EOC fromthese groups. This has occurred in no small way because, in the words ofthe Simpson Report, &quot;a given group's work attempts to cover instrumentationdevelopment, ground station operations, algorithm development, applicationsdevelopment, validation and product delivery. This task is too big for small,geographically isolated groups.&quot; The Simpson Report arose from a reviewof the Data Acquisition and Utilisation MDP-19. However, I believe the strongmove towards an EOC in CSIRO does not come from needs unique to the datagathering segments but from the wider truth of this statement. It appliesto the whole of the productive remote sensing and Earth Observing researchcommunity that has developed in CSIRO.<BR><BR>The time has come when the value of focussing the skills of groups of scientistson issues common to the remote sensing science underpinning the applicationsacross many Divisions has become too great to deny. Modern remote sensingresearch has advanced from descriptive earth 'observation' through an eraof data gathering and exploratory image processing to a point where thevalue of remote sensing data as measurements is paramount. Remotely sensedmeasurements can be collected in a range of data dimensions and at timeand space scales which cannot be accessed in any other way. This has enabledgeographical applications to proceed in terms of scientific models and processunderstanding. The physical link between the data and the parameters ofinterest to users is providing the returns that previous image processingand 'correlation' based approaches could only suggest as being possible.'Making the transition' from close-range data that the end user can understandand needs to the recorded counts in a remotely sensed data stream is today'schallenge for remote sensing.<BR><BR>This can be accomplished in a way that serves the needs of the establishedapplications areas in CSIRO and the wider Australian community. The meansis to thread together the internationally acclaimed skills of CSIRO researchersand provide them with the opportunity, support and facilities to jointlytackle common scientific themes and issues. The themes and issues tackledmust be those which underpin the applications being pursued in the individual,industry oriented Divisions and in the growing value added industry throughoutAustralia. <BR>This common base of interest includes issues relating to: <BLOCKQUOTE><UL><LI>sensor and instrument design and characteristics; <LI>base data processing; <LI>calibration and geometric/geographic modelling; <LI>integration with other data; <LI>atmospheric corrections; <LI>data management; <LI>the measurement models relating remotely sensed data and the targetsof applications; and <LI>the most effective computational algorithms; </UL></BLOCKQUOTE>I believe an effective network of remote sensing scientists can be developed.It will consist of a well supported core group of scientists drawn fromcurrent CSIRO staff plus a few complementary and supporting additional staff.The core group will develop a network with remote sensing scientists inapplications areas and work in projects with them to provide their areasof applications with the means to make much greater progress. This willoccur as their efforts will not be dissipated in attempts to cover all thetasks and resolve all the problems arising between instrument deploymentand product delivery. Such activity was identified as a common problem amongthe AVHRR data collectors in the Simpson Report.<BR><BR>The Simpson report also proposed a new focus for MDP-19 which was to develop'Level 1.5' products that could overcome the need for applications orientedgroups to solve the problems in the list above. However, I disagree withthe assumption made in the Report that &quot;science focus areas (Level2) naturally will emerge if the Level 1.5 work is done well.&quot; The workof the Centre must be focussed on the measurement models that enable theapplications. The Level 1.5 products are the raw material on which boththe Centre and the applications research areas can work.<BR><BR>The viewpoint of the core group and associated Divisional scientists - collectivelythe EOC - should also not be focussed on particular instruments nor theirspecialised data. Rather, the EOC should emphasise applications and themeasurement models that relate the targets to the appropriate range of availableraw data. For example, monitoring vegetation cover has applications at manyscales and finer scale data is usually needed to define cover/image relationships.If the working scale is 1:10,000 to 1:25,000 then airborne data and possiblySpot or TM data can meet the needs - but AVHRR cannot. On the other hand,at regional scale, the integration provided by AVHRR can match the scalingof the application's needs and the different platform and sensor becomesthe appropriate data. The central issue, however, is that underlying allthe choices are the radiative transfer in the coupled atmosphere and surfacelayer and its scaling behaviour.<BR><BR>The primary activity therefore must include flexible considerations of sensorcharacteristics and scale of platforms together with the way they createmeasurements of water covered areas, complex land surfaces and the atmosphere.The specific issues (including scale and areas of application) relatingto particular instruments can be gathered productively within the measurementthemes. The priorities and emphases of the groupings must be determinedby the needs of the applications. The areas of application must reflectthe interests of the Divisions and other clients in the Australian EarthObservation industry rather than the interests of the individual scientists.<BR><BR>Remote sensing and Earth Observation are not only about satellite data noronly about low resolution meteorological satellite data. The pressing needsfor environmental monitoring demand data with spatial scales from 1:5,000to 1:5,000,000 and time scales from daily to decadal. It would be a seriousomission to ignore the tactical monitoring and assessment issues createdby sudden or localised disturbances and natural disasters. They are as importantto respond to as the longer term environmental changes being monitored byspace observing systems. In addition, integrating the observations at anindividual site with satellite data without concern for the intermediatescales creates a disturbing gap in calibration methodology. This gap canonly be filled if there is a commitment to higher spatial, spectral andtemporal resolution earth observation in the centre. It is no accident thatthe advanced EOS instrument - MODIS - has high spectral resolution and multi-scaledata.<BR><BR>I believe that the EOC must also from the beginning address the issues involvedwith airborne (1:5,000 to 1:10,000 scale) data and the higher spatial andspectral resolution sensors they carry. This must be done within the sameintegrated framework of measurement models and algorithms it develops todeal with satellite data and the various sensors they carry. The scalabilityof processing and the interpretation algorithms is both practical and fundamentalto creating successful operational and packaged links between sensor andtarget on any platform. Developments in instruments able to be deployedon aircraft at the present time is similar to the development of PCs inthe early 80's. Very soon the range of options will be enormous and theopportunities they create for rapid tactical earth observation must notbe neglected. The greatest opportunity lies in the potential for them tobe calibrated and have sensitive, narrow and flexibly placed spectral bands.Their needs in this case are exactly for the science and algorithms theEOC has the capacity to provide. As an example of how measurement modelscan integrate with the data processing stream, I have attached a documentdescribing some of the airborne work that has been done at CSIRO Divisionof water Resources. This work is currently being developed in a controlledcombination of commercialisation and collaborative international research.<BR><BR>For the centre to be successful, there is a need to create strong threadsof collaboration and interaction among the excellent scientists currentlydispersed throughout CSIRO. Some should become fully part of the core EOCbut others should simply be encouraged and supported to make use of theEOC and participate in joint research. This would be ensured through makingsignificant (eg 3 or more month) visits to other laboratories and/or theEOC centres essential components of the collaboration. The EOC could consistof one primary core group in a single location plus more tempory 'satellite'groups which are developed in collaborating Divisions and centres for specificprojects and studies. Exchange and significant visits between the Australiangroups are alternatives to re-location. They may well provide the 'glue'the EOC needs in order to create open collaboration, trust and frequentcontact between the scientists that make up the strong base of skills infundamental remote sensing science. The budget of the EOC will need a veryvisible and solid allocation for this activity rather than either beingrestricted to the core group at the centre or dispersed in small allocations.The alternative provision of separate small 'grants' to geographically separatedgroups can only make the fragmentation and lack of critical mass at theseparate sites worse.<BR><BR>The EOC should also encourage joint projects with industry. Its clientsmust potentially be inside and outside CSIRO. In the early 1980's, the CanadianCCRS pursued a policy of collaboration with industry in fundamental sciencethat involved secondment of staff from industry to CCRS for extended periodsas part of the R&amp;D. This has created a strong science and research focusin the Canadian earth observation industry which has paid off considerably.Tasks that could be done by industry or that were desirable for industryto take on were always contracted out rather than done in-house - but withclose collaboration and staff exchange. You cannot assist industry by competingwith it. I believe this is the cooperative model the EOC should also adopt.In doing so, the Centre will also need to address the concerns of industryfor standards, economic evaluation of alternative data sources, informationthroughput and the cost-effectiveness of different levels of value adding.It is through industry contact that the Centre can contribute to these importantanalyses.<BR><BR>It is no accident that centres such as the EOC have emerged in recent yearsin other countries and are developing a strong network between their scientists.The issues that must be tackled to realise the opportunities of an EOC areinternational by nature. They can only be successfully resolved by veryclose and collaborative contact between researchers at similar centres indifferent countries. In particular, links must be made with the US, Canada,Europe, China, Japan and the ASEAN members. Without such strong internationalcollaboration the EOC may achieve less than is being achieved now by thedispersed but internationally active groups. The EOC needs to put specialemphasis on promoting and enabling contact, collaboration and joint publicationbetween Australian and other scientists working on remote sensing sciencethroughout the world. Bringing scientists to Australia and sending Australiansoverseas are fundamental activities once the internal contacts have beenestablished. Participation in international projects and forums will pay-offsignificantly in this area and must be encouraged. It should be emphasised,however, that this cannot be achieved only through participation in international<I>committees</I> but by international <I>collaboration</I>.<BR><BR>The EOC will succeed if it creates an environment in which the solutionto the 'Prisoner's Dilemma' is carefully encouraged to be cooperation ratherthan to take what is offered but give as little as possible. As a personwho has worked for many years to see remote sensing applied I believe theEOC can enhance the flow of applications if its focus is well directed.However, to succeed in the face of realities, I believe it will also needto have strong support from Executive level down and have a high degreeof independence, discretion and support. The Advisory Committee (for example)should not run the EOC but be like the Board of a Company with the ScienceProgram Leader as MD. The 'MD' also needs the capacity to make decisionsand make them stick. There may come times when the success or total failureof the EOC depends on the leverage that is provided to the EOC. Speakingsoftly but carrying a big stick was never more important. The next yearwill be an exciting one for all concerned with the venture but where itall ends will depend on the decisions made in the very near future.<BR><BR>Attachment: Integrated <B><A HREF="dis1a.htm">Airborne Sensing</A> </B>at<B></B>CSIRO Division of Water Resources <BR><HR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HR></BODY></HTML>

Graetz, A.J. Prata, J.S. Wallace, and I.J. Barton</I></B> <BR><BR><B>PREAMBLE</B> <BR><BR>The compilation of this document was both a pleasure and a challenge. <BR><BR>It was a pleasure because all the authors believe in the concept of theEarth Observation Centre and are committed to its implementation. It waschallenge to find and articulate the shared core of agreement. That wasnot easy: the debate has been spirited and detailed with independent inputsfrom many interested research staff. <BR><BR>Even so, the four authors of this document share its vision and mission,and are committed to their implementation. However, the separate groupsof research staff represented by each author differed in their support ofthe three areas of research activity defined below. Research areas 1 &amp;2, which will account for almost all activity (&gt;95%) was supported everywhere,whereas area 3 was only supported by Melbourne, Hobart and Canberra. <BR><BR>In this section of our report, we set out the argument that we developedsince being commissioned and which has shaped the research strategy proposedin the next section. <BR><BR>Two propositions underpin all. <BR><BR>The first is that CSIRO is a research organisation: its prime directiveis to undertake scientific research. Within CSIRO, components such as COSSAand CIRC, have different functions. Even though the concept of the EarthObservation Centre arose from a COSSA-initiated review, and COSSA has theresponsibility to create the Earth Observation Centre, the essential natureof the Earth Observation Centre will differ substantially from that of COSSA.The Earth Observation Centre will be part of main-stream CSIRO. <B>Thereforethe prime directive and ethos of the Earth Observation Centre must be theconduct of scientific research.</B> <BR><BR>This is an important point that was raised in the Implementation Document(COSSASteering Committee) and we reiterate it here. <BR><BR>The concerns that led to the concept of the Earth Observation Centre partlyarose from data issues; of these, some were related to research but mostwere not. A focus on data issues dominates the circulated vision and missiondiscussions in the 'Implementation Plan' and the draft 'Outline of StrategicPlan, etc.'. We do not accept this emphasis. We are convinced that an EarthObservation Centre within CSIRO must be based on relevant, high qualityresearch activities. <BR><BR>Therefore, this document proposes a wider view that embraces all data issuesand integrates them within a comprehensive research strategy. <BR><BR><B>This view is that in the current era of Earth observation activities,research and data are inextricably and synergistically linked. </B><BR><BR>It is obvious to us that a strategy of emphasising data at the expense ofresearch has no future in the CSIRO of today or tomorrow. Conversely, astrategy of research that ignores data management will continue the emasculatedconditions of these last few years that led to the formation of MDP # 19,and its subsequent review. <BR><BR>The second proposition is that the Earth Observation Centre should addressthe big issues: those characterised by broad spatial scales over long timeintervals to which Earth Observation data make a unique and underpinningcontribution. These are the issues that can really only be addressed withspace data. Moreover, we should address not only the current research questionsbut what is more important, consider those questions that are not presentlybeing asked. <BR><BR><B>The Earth Observation Centre should become a leading and singular researchinstitution. </B><BR><BR>Furthermore, we believe this can be achieved in a manner that is complementaryto activities within Divisions and without excluding any significant researchthemes. We illustrate this with a hypothetical research program in the Appendix.<BR><BR><B>On the basis of on these two propositions, the central thrust of thisdocument is to propose a bold but operationally sustainable integrationof research and data management, the Research Strategy, to underpin theEarth Observation Centre over the next five years, 1995-2000. </B><BR><BR>In addition, we also discuss several implementation issues that we believeare not usefully separated from the proposed Research Strategy. Like theStrategy, these implementation issues have been discussed amongst us andthe views of our colleagues that were canvassed and considered. <BR><BR>To illustrate and support our proposals made in the next section, we herecollect some the many facets of shaping the Earth Observation Centre thatwere considered. <BR><BR>The acceptability of the Earth Observation Centre within CSIRO managementand its attractiveness to research staff will be determined almost entirelyby the formulation and implementation of its Research Strategy. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, once accepted, the Earth Observation Centre ResearchStrategy must be widely and speedily communicated within CSIRO, and implementedin the Earth Observation Centre development. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Because COSSA and the Earth Observation Centre have very different rolesand responsibilities within CSIRO, the Earth Observation Centre must beindependent of COSSA in the pursuit of its role within the constraint ofits essential requirement to report to the Director of COSSA. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, it is essential that the research and developmentdirections of the Earth Observation Centre be set by the Leader and staffwith input from Divisions and an Advisory Committee (see later). </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Now that the Earth Observation Centre is a reality, albeit still a fledgling,its identity and support needs to be indelibly confirmed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, we recommend that MDP #19 be terminated as soon asis possible and that its remaining funding be transferred to the Leaderof the Earth Observation Centre for disposition, and that this financialindependence be continued; </BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>in addition, we believe it to be critical that the Earth ObservationCentre creates and communicates its own identity, and manages its own informationaccess independently of COSSA. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Two aspects of the creation of the Earth Observation Centre will enhanceremote sensing within CSIRO: by providing a disciplinary focus, and, moreinfluential, by the collocation of staff. However, if staff remain distributedacross Australia, then opportunities for productive interaction will remainlimited and thus the output of the Earth Observation Centre is unlikelyto be very different from the current output from the separate Divisions.<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, the collocation of staff is obviously the preferredoption wherever possible but it remains a practical problem that must befaced. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>The Earth Observation Centre research areas should not be traditional disciplineareas, for otherwise the overlap with Divisions will be too great and thenecessity of the Earth Observation Centre will be questioned. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore the Earth Observation Centre must include in its researchfocus, areas that do not rest comfortably within Divisions or cover areascommon to many Divisions. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>While it is important to set out the long term strategic goals of the researchand development, their creation will always risk the generation of unrealisticexpectations amongst some users. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, the Earth Observation Centre should set both longterm strategic goals as well as short term objectives arising from interactionswith the user communities; <BR><BR>the Earth Observation Centre objectives should be clear, open and achievablewith the resources available. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR><B>RESEARCH STRATEGY</B> <BR><BR>The research strategy that we outline below is simple, general, and hasthree components; vision, mission and activities. <BR><BR>No specific objectives are defined. <BR><BR>We see the essential role of the Earth Observation Centre as being synergisticand facilitating for research scientists already actively engaged in theirown research and responsive their own interests, capabilities and funding.The focus of the Earth Observation Centre will enhance this research activity,and through coordinated data management, benefit a larger and more diverseclientele than before. <BR><BR>The focus of the Earth Observation Centre is not to re-orient existing researchin the short term: rather, we want to do what we do far more effectively.<BR><BR><B>Vision Statement.</B> <BR><BR>We begin with a succinct statement of the essential nature and directionof the Earth Observation Centre: <BR><BR><B>'To ensure that Australia gains maximum benefit from the applicationof Earth Observation data.'</B> <BR><BR><B>Mission Statement</B> <BR><BR>Translating the Vision statement into a broad action plan, we write: <BR><BR><B>'The Earth Observation Centre will conduct multidisciplinary researchand development based on remotely sensed and other data for the benefitof the Australian and global communities'</B> <BR><BR>We see this benefit being realised from the innovative and efficient extractionof relevant information from Earth Observation data. These three adjectiveslink research, development and application; they describe the three componentsrequired for an end-to-end approach. <BR><BR><B>Research Activities</B> <BR><BR>The research objectives pursued within the Earth Observation Centre willbe diverse, reflecting the interests and collaboration of individual scientists.Therefore, as discussed above, it is difficult and counter-productive todefine and prioritise research objectives. It is far more useful to definethe three areas of research activity within which the spectrum of researcheffort could be managed. Continuing and potential cooperation and collaborationwith research staff from CSIRO Divisions and other organisations (DEST,DoPI&amp;E, DSTO) is implicit throughout. <BR><BR>While these activities are broadly defined below, they proscribe farm-leveldecision-support systems, that are increasingly being covered by other publicand private sector organisations. <BR><BR>The three areas of research activities follow. These activities are exemplifiedin the Appendix that also illustrates the nature and extent of the potentialinteractions between the EOC and CSIRO Divisions. <BR><BR><B>1. Earth Observation Science and Data Analysis</B>: To undertake theresearch necessary for the development of generic methods (measurement models)to relate satellite data recorded above the Earth's atmosphere to geophysicalvariables; these variables being required to address broader current andpotential research questions within the Earth Observation Centre, CSIROand the wider research community. <BR><BR>Measurement models include scene, sensor, atmosphere and image processingsub-models that in combination, determine the accuracy and precision ofthe derived geophysical variables. <BR><BR>Measurement models are required for the retrospective analysis of currentEarth Observation data archives, eg. AVHRR, as well as for the prospectivedatasets, eg. ADEOS, SPOT Vegetation Instrument, SeaWIFS and EOS. <BR><BR>While it has and will continue to be applications research that createsthe need for highest quality Earth Observation datasets, <B>it is the developmentand application of measurement models that remains the key to the productionof the value-added datasets required by the research community</B>. <BR><BR>As an illustration, an AVHRR Science Working Group has been established,originally within MDP #19 and now the EOC, to prescribe the processing ofa standard set of geophysical datasets to be generated by the EOC and madeavailable to CSIRO research staff: these datasets include sea surface temperature(SST), land surface temperature (LST), surface albedo (a VIS, a NIR, a SOLAR)and NDVI (a vegetation index). In addition, an analogous GMS PathfinderScience Working Group has been established in collaboration with the Universityof California, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Australian National University,and the University of Tasmania. <BR><BR><B>2. Calibration / Validation</B>: To undertake the required field andlaboratory research to support the development of measurement models evaluatingeither the accuracy of sensor performance (calibration) or of derived geophysicalvariables (validation). <BR><BR><B>Both measurement models</B>, when translated to algorithms, <B>and Calibration/ Validation activities</B> as a source of ancillary data and process understanding,<B>are fundamental to the generation and documentation of geophysical datasets for distribution by the CSIRO DAACs for subsequent application by thewider research community.</B> <BR><BR>Calibration / Validation research activities are critical to success inaddressing many contemporary scientific questions: it is not an unreasonableassertion that it is now the most critical issue in the application of spacedata. The importance of Calibration / Validation research is now widelyrecognised by organisations such as CEOS and EOS, and by individual spacecraftmissions that have sought, or are seeking CSIRO expertise in this researcharea; eg. the ATSR instrument on ERS-1/2, POLDER on ADEOS, and the VegetationInstrument on SPOT 4. <BR><BR>Calibration / Validation research activities will ensure the highest qualitydatasets are available to the Australian and global research communities.It is anticipated that within this research activity, there will be considerablecollaboration with Divisional research staff; see Appendix. <BR><BR><B>3. Sensors and Systems:</B> Australia has a growing aerospace industrythat has, in the past, found valuable research support for development programsfrom within CSIRO. These activities will continue to grow and CSIRO hasa vital role to play in supporting these programs. The research skills requiredfor the success of development programs in Earth Observation are currentlynot available from other Australian institutes. <BR><BR>It is important that there is a national focus for this area of researchand, for CSIRO, the activity is far better suited to the EOC than to individualDivisions. <BR><BR>The Earth Observation Centre can become this focus through secondment fromCSIRO or from industry, and <B>by managing the research component only</B>.<BR><BR>These three research activities represent a significant change in emphasisand allocation of tasks from the Earth Observation Centre concept proposedby COSSA in the draft Implementation Plan. <B>The emphasis has been placedon getting the research component right but not to the exclusion of datamanagement</B> that is implicit in all that is stated above. <BR><BR>Stated simply: <BR><BR>Co-ordinated scientific research and development is the only sustainablelocomotive for generating useful Earth Observation value-added products;<BR><BR>Strategic research and development first requires, and then generates EarthObservation datasets; <BR><BR>The two key elements are co-ordinated Research and Development, and DataManagement. <BR><BR>Both elements are critical and interactive, but for the Australian communityto benefit from Earth Observation Centre activities the nature and directionof Data Management activities must support and complement those of Researchand Development. <BR><BR>We envisage an interactive interdependence of Research and Development andData Management within the Earth Observation Centre, and this relationshipis simplified in the following diagram. <BR><BR><IMG SRC="diag.gif" ALIGN=bottom WIDTH="781" HEIGHT="847" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR>Data Management alone is a relatively simple problem to solve. It is farmore difficult to co-ordinate Research and Development with Data Managementso that end-to-end solutions are provided and the value-added datasets generatedand captured. Nonetheless, we see the solution to this problem as beingone of research-leadership rather that data-driven. <BR><BR><B>Leader</B> <BR><BR>Because the scope of Earth Observation Centre research activities is sobroad, it is unlikely that any one person can be an effective research leader.The maintenance of research standards can be assured with the review processwithin and without the Earth Observation Centre. However, the maintenanceand co-ordination of research effort and the interaction with clients, bothactual and potential, are by far the most important tasks to keep the EarthObservation Centre on track and viable. <BR><BR>Thus, we see the critical attributes of the Leader as being: <BR><BR>a distinguished background in Earth Observation science; <BR><BR>a capacity and willingness to manage the Earth Observation Centre research;<BR><BR>a capacity to find and interact with the beneficiaries of Earth ObservationCentre activities both within and without CSIRO; <BR><BR>a capacity and willingness to seek external funding. <BR><BR>We also believe the next critical step in the development of the Earth ObservationCentre is the appointment of the Leader. We urge that this be urgently addressedwith the leader being appointed for an initial period of 5 years, locatedin Canberra. <BR><BR><B>REFLECTION and GUIDANCE</B> <BR><BR>The Earth Observation Centre is a new concept within CSIRO and effectivelywithout peer within Australia; the organisations of ERIN (DEST), NRIC andAGSO, both (DoPI&amp;E), being considered in this assessment. The role models,or at least analogues of the Earth Observation Centre are thus mostly international.Therefore, attention must be given to providing mechanisms that will providean international reflection of our direction, activities and performancein a way that will support the best possible management of the Earth ObservationCentre resources; people, funds, and time. <BR><BR>Two mechanisms are suggested: the Earth Observation Centre Fellowships,and an Advisory Committee. <BR><BR><B>Earth Observation Centre Fellowships</B> <BR><BR>The Earth Observation Centre Fellowships have already started with the firstand current award being to Jim Simpson. Jim Simpson has played a significantrole in the concept and establishment of the Earth Observation Centre andhe has continued to contribute to research during the brief period of hisFellowship. <BR><BR>Following in this role, Earth Observation Centre Fellowships can providea mirror to our performance and direction. To do this, the award needs tobe to a distinguished but interesting and active scientist, for a briefperiod of time. Earth Observation Centre Fellowships are different from,and in addition to, visiting research scientists to the Centre. <BR><BR>It is recommended that the award by invitation of Earth Observation CentreFellowships be continued at an annual rate, and that they continue to becarefully selected such that the benefit to the Earth Observation Centreis clear and widely distributed. <BR><BR><B>Advisory Committee</B> <BR><BR>We believe that the direction and functioning of the Earth Observation Centrewould benefit from interaction with a small expert committee - an AdvisoryCommittee. <BR><BR>Because of the vision and mission of the Earth Observation Centre, we suggestthis small committee be convened annually and comprise the following: <BR><BR>Director, COSSA <BR><BR>Leader, Earth Observation Centre <BR><BR>Chief of Division (one only, most relevant, rotating) <BR><BR>Bureau of Meteorology representative (most relevant) <BR><BR>NASA representative (eg. Martha Maiden) <BR><BR>ESA representative (eg. equivalent to NASA representative) <BR><BR>Research institution analogue (rotating, eg. Yann Kerr, Director of LERTS).<BR><BR>The intent and function of this Advisory Committee are clear from our suggestedmembership. The final choice should be made by the Leader of the Earth ObservationCentre. <BR><BR>We believe it is critical to regularly take professional advice from a widerange of sources; particularly from outside CSIRO and Australia becausethe Earth Observation Centre will become a significant functional link inthe emerging international web of Earth Observation science and data analysis.To orient our activities by the Earth Observation Centre Vision - to ensurethat Australia gains maximum benefit from the innovative and efficient applicationof Earth Observation data - we must regularly assess our performance byinternational standards. <BR><BR><B>APPENDIX</B> <BR><BR><B>Research Strategy exemplified</B> <BR><BR>To illustrate how the research strategy would be applied in the EOC, a fictitiousexample is described which also illustrates the perceived roles of the EOCand individual Divisions and the way these groups may interact on commonresearch topics. <BR><BR>The example given is for an application of AVHRR data, but future EOC activitieswill also include data from other earth observation instruments and platforms(e.g. SAR, SeaWiFS, OCTS, MODIS etc.). <BR><BR>THE APPLICATION OF AVHRR DATA IN THE MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH OF LOCUST PLAGUEEVENTS <BR><BR>Project Stages. <BR><BR><B>1. Reception</B> (direct or indirect) of raw AVHRR data over the studyarea. <BR><BR><B>2. Routine processing</B> of AVHRR data to provide at-satellite, navigatedbrightness temperatures in the infrared channels and radiances in the visible/nearinfrared channels. <BR><BR>This activity requires conversion of the raw data using calibration coefficientsand navigation into earth coordinates using orbital elements, an orbitalmodel and ground control points. <BR><BR><B>3. Derivation of standard geophysical products</B> from the brightnesstemperatures/radiances. <BR><BR>These products include sea surface temperature, land surface temperature,surface albedo and NDVI (a vegetation index). <BR><BR>The production of these parameters requires the detection of cloud contaminateddata, correction for atmospheric effects (absorption and scattering) andthe inclusion of surface and solar geometry. <BR><BR>The four products mentioned above should be considered standard productsthat will be produced automatically by the EOC for use by CSIRO Divisionsin their research programs, and in applications developed by particulardivisions. <BR><BR><B>4. Standard statistical techniques</B> for data analysis, compositingof data, production of time series, filling in missing (cloudy) values,etc. <BR><BR><B>5. Development of new parameters</B> for highlighting locust active oraffected areas (new NDVIs?, thermal data may be useful here?). <BR><BR>Comparisons with climatological data. <BR><BR>Collection of ground data for validation of satellite-derived parameters.<BR><BR>Development of task-specific analysis techniques. <BR><BR><B>6. Assessment of locust damage</B>, forecast of locust paths, deploymentof ground based resources (aircraft spraying of insecticide etc.). <BR><BR>Use of satellite data to forecast future areas of locust plague outbreaks.<BR><BR><B>EOC activities: </B>Actions 1, 2, 3 and 4 as described above are activitiesthat are common to any research project or application of satellite dataand these should be seen as the responsibility of the EOC. The first researchactivity described in the strategy thus includes investigations to providehigh quality standard geophysical data products from satellite data. Theseactivities will include data calibration, cloud detection and clearing,correction for atmospheric effects in the visible, infrared and microwavebands, navigation of satellite data and the development of common statisticaltechniques for data analysis. <BR><BR><B>Divisional activities: </B>Actions 5 and 6 clearly belong in individualDivisions of CSIRO as they pertain to specific research programs and applications.However, there are obviously areas here where some interaction is required.For example, the ground validation data collected by the Division shouldbe used by the EOC in the assessment of the quality of their derived standardproducts. Divisions may also

ABOUT THE CSIRO EOC</H4><BR>AVHRR has provided the world community with global data and a dense timeseries of earth observation now for at least 15 years. However, it is onlyrelatively recently that the data have moved out of the research area tobe evaluated in the 'workplace' of end user needs. This has come about inAustralia from the development of operational receiving stations and programsof archiving and processing the data received over the continent and EEZ.<BR><BR>CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications (COSSA) and Agencies suchas the Bureau of Meteorology have played a significant role in this developmentand today the availability of daily near real time and archival time seriesof data for the Australian region is unprecedented. Nevertheless, the developmentof this capability has not been without its problems. Many of these weredescribed in a review carried out on behalf of COSSA of its Data Acquisitionand Utilisation multi-Divisional Program MDP-19 . In this report (oftenreferred to as the Simpson Report from its principal author) many of theissues of fragmentation and dispersion of effort were outlined and remediessuggested.<BR><BR>One of the outcomes of the Simpson Report has been the formation of theEarth Observation Centre (EOC) which is developing to provide a focus andidentity for CSIRO Earth Observation Research and Development as well asact to coordinate some of the activities that were identified in the SimpsonReport as limiting to the full value being obtained from CSIRO activities.In the area of Land AVHRR use there is considerable focus and activity amongCSIRO scientists who either as part of the formative EOC or from the Divisionswith which it is working closely will outline their work to you this morning.They are among scientists who have been and will in the future engage incross-Divisional projects in the fields of: <UL><LI>Data Management [<I>with data providers and distributors</I>] <LI>Advanced Information Processing <LI>Calibration and Validation <LI>Advanced Measurement Models Based Products <LI>Applications Support [<I>with Divisions and Industry</I>] </UL>The knowledge base for the projects largely rests in the Divisions and thework will be aimed to support the Divisional needs in data and the Divisionalinterface with clients and users in the Sectors which the Divisions address.However, we see an underlying generic set of activities which are biggerin scope than can be handled by any one Division and which underpin theeventual acceptance and usefulness of the products to the real end users- people who want information about the world and the way it is changing.<BR><BR>The EOC is an initiative that has been developing for some time and is nowfully and rapidly moving to address generic issues in the areas outlinedabove. It aims to maximise the benefit obtained from the activities of theexcellent earth observation scientists in CSIRO and see it impact effectivelyon the development of the industries that can put the information to work.In order to do this fully, however, I believe we must all (researchers,producers and users together) consider the issue of data and product standards.<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="wshop2.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

INTRODUCTION<BR></B><BR>The primary aim of the LAND AVHRR Workshop was to promote ideas and to breakdown any real or perceived barriers between the data acquisition, modellingand application communities.<BR>AVHRR data were viewed in the workshop as being processed to three productlevels, these are base, standard and research products. There are severaloperational environment management systems in place that rely heavily onAVHRR data. In the workshop these applications were given the opportunityto voice their concerns and hopes for future AVHRR processing at the threelevels above.<BR><BR>From the general discussions there arose a series of common questions: <UL><LI>What generic changes can occur to the data acquisition, base and standardproduct development which will mean improvements to all applications? <LI>What mechanisms need to be in place by the data acquisition, base andstandard product development community to ensure that the users needs areadequately meet? Are the users needs and desires realistic and achievable?<LI>How can the application community make better decisions from the currentlyavailable data sets? </UL>To provide a framework for readers who did not attend the workshop, thelisting of presenters is given later. Some additional copies of the workshopproceedings are available from Tim McVicar on a first come first servedbasis.<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="avout2.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

1. Changchun</H3>

<BR>

On Friday September 13 a variety of international BRDF people met at the

Youyi Binguan (Friendship Hotel) in Beijing, registered and readied themselves

for a two-part meeting - the first International Workshop On Multiangular

Remote Sensing (Measurements, Models And Applications).<BR>

<BR>

The Meeting was organised by members of the Institute of Remote Sensing

Applications (IRSA) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and of the

Beijing Normal University. There was international help as well, especially

from Alan Strahler's group at Boston University. The first part of the Meeting

was held in Changchun, a city to the north of Beijing in Jilin. It is known

as the Detroit of China due to its vehicle production industry and historically

it is remembered as the Capital of Manchu Guo, the puppet state set up by

Japan in 1931 with the last emperor Pu Yi as head. But neither of these

brought us there. Near Changchun is the Jingyuetan Remote Sensing Test Site.<BR>

<BR>

Operated by the CAS, the Test Site has a wide range of land covers and has

been the site of many field experiments and validation campaigns. Since

1980, an extensive laboratory facility has been developed. In particular,

we came to see the indoor Solar Simulation Laboratory. This is a large scale

goniometer with an artificial source to simulate the sun and moveable positions

for sun/sensor effects measurement. The target measured is a square metre

of anything you can fit in a square meter. A small table top instrument

has also been developed to allow multi-angular measurements of reflectance

and transmittance at the scale of leaves.<BR>

<BR>

We saw the site in operation and the data processed in quick time as 3D

plots. There was considerable discussion of the various edge effects and

conditions that make this type of facility similar or different to <I>in

situ</I> measurements. We were all impressed by the facility. I wish we

had one even if only to calibrate our field panels! But not all is lost,

since we are welcome to define and conduct experiments at Jingyuetan. Indeed,

if field campaigns were made at the general site, example patches could

be tested for complete BRDF at the same time. It beats using a Spectron

SE590 out in the weather while the sun and sky change around you. Meanwhile,

a graduate student can be measuring the leaves as well!<BR>

<BR>

Nearby is a solar observatory on a hill top with a dome roof that opens

allowing a range of continuous sun photometer and irradiance device data

to be collected. Quite an investment has been made and in principle a high

level of characterisation could be had at Jingyuetan - to a level we have

no hope of matching in Australia at this time.<BR>

<BR>

After a good lunch on Sunday September 15 (which by itself was probably

enough to justify further collaboration and cooperative development) we

flew back to (warmer) Beijing for the next phase of the Workshop.<BR>

<H3>2. Beijing</H3>

<BR>

On the morning of Monday September 16 the talking and discussion part of

the Workshop began. We were welcomed by a group of very senior and distinguished

people from the CAS and the State Science and Technology Commission. Juhan

Ross, the 'grand old man' of radiation in plant canopies and Alan Strahler

(who is still quite young) gave Keynote Addresses which set the scene for

the Meeting.<BR>

<BR>

There followed two days (two half days and one full day) of very intensively

packed presentations. The program as presented, with speaker (bolded) and

topic is attached for you to read. The papers will be available in the near

future for you to look more carefully at talks that are especially relevant

to you. In this Report, I will limit my discussion to general impressions

plus a detailed set of notes on the outcomes Discussion that occurred on

Wednesday September 18<BR>

<BR>

Of course, a primary outcome for such meetings is for people working in

a field to meet, get to know each other if that has not happened before,

exchange ideas both during sessions and at any other time that is available

and jointly develop their ideas of the directions that need to be pursued

into the future. All of these happened.<BR>

<H3>3. General Notes &amp; Impressions</H3>

<H4>3.1 Parametric BRDF</H4>

<BR>

It was very comforting to see how the recent simplifications to BRDF models

(the 'kernel' and similar simple models) were performing well as tools in

atmospheric correction and image brightness correction at airborne, TM and

AVHRR data scales. Simplified models and linearity are obviously fashionable

but also provide very practical tools to describe and use BRDF for applications

such as those above and others such as panel characterisation. Obviously,

the scope for such techniques is about to increase with the launch of ADEOS

carrying POLDER and will further increase as MODIS and MISR data start to

come on line in a more distant time frame.<BR>

<BR>

These developments were outlined in Talks [1-8], [2-5], [3-3], [3-5], [3-6]

and [4-2]<BR>

<H4>3.2 Hospot Specific Instrumentation</H4>

<BR>

Sig Gerstl [1-2] provided advance notice for an innovative mission to utilise

the hotspot region from space using an active laser and tethered receivers.

It is 'Bi-static Lidar' I guess and the technology is feasible. All that

is needed is for the extra value of the information to be proven over not

doing it! His ideas are not alone in that.<BR>

<H4>3.3 Field and Laboratory Instrumentation</H4>

<BR>

There was a strong emphasis on field and laboratory measurement. In summarising

his session, Juhan Ross said that the main advances have been in computer

technology and in constructing measurement instruments. Instrumentation

and measurement protocols are very difficult but essential components of

the research and also of the applications. The ideas included field data

for structural characterisation as well as radiometric measurements. In

addition to the Changchun site, there is a goniometer in Italy at the European

Goniometric Observatory (EGO) which is also producing many detailed studies

of BRDF at the one square metre plot scale. It was clear, however, that

the leaf measurements being taken at Changchun were the envy of most and

we all hope to see outcomes being published and information made available

in the future.<BR>

<BR>

There is still a lot to be done relative to the 'scattering phase functions'

of the objects that different user models and radiative models want and

can deal with. Leaf measurements need to be linked to high spectral resolution

data and plant physiological information (such as chlorophyll and pigments)

as well. However, the tools are emerging to do this which did not previously

exist. At the 'module' or 'branch' scale, Juhan Ross described an instrument

for measuring scattering that is being used in Estonia (the 'Shoot Goniometer')

and for short crops and other covers, the large indoor Goniometers at Changchun

and ISPRA are obviously filling a need.<BR>

<BR>

However, in order to relate models, measurements and the objectives of the

users there is still some work to be done in describing and recording structure

in the non-homogeneous canopies we mostly work with. Juhan Ross and Tiit

Nilson were especially adamant of the need to introduce such protocols of

field description and measurement and emphasised that they need to relate

to the end use. Given the limited relationships between (say) traditional

forestry data and radiation data this may mean the definition of a set of

new phytometrical measurements. The Chinese work by Xiang Yueqin and Wang

Jindi ([1-11], [1-12]) is very interesting in this regard.<BR>

<BR>

Other talks covering this area were: [1-1], [1-4], [1-5], [1-9], [1-10],

[2-9] and [3-1]<BR>

<H4>3.4 Modelling &amp; Inversion</H4>

<BR>

The recent main advances in modelling seem to have been computational rather

than by changes in the physics and/or mathematics. There are now a well

defined set of models that can adequately describe the BRDF of structured

land covers. What is not so common are the parameters of the component properties

of the models (such as leaf phase functions!) and there is still scope for

computational simplifications and more robust techniques for inversion.<BR>

<BR>

Andres Kuusk and others described a number of uses of parameter inversion

with Landsat TM and AVHRR data. With Landsat TM data, Kuusk was inverting

chlorophyll content using relationships obtained from field and laboratory

measurements. Inversion is obviously the aim of this work and has still

to be made simpler and more robust.<BR>

<BR>

As a complete test base for models and measurements associated with the

EGO, Michel Verstraete described the Monte-Carlo RayTran model which has

been running on a supercomputer at ISPRA. Able to be linked to an L-System

model of the land surface it provides a good base for model testing and

data interpretation. He also described work in which the leaf structure

is modelled by simple geometric forms (cylinders, spheres and sheets). He

was keen to form an 'Observation Protocol' for the data that will be generated

in the future.<BR>

<BR>

Such work obviously sits at the interface between measurement and modelling.

At this advancing stage of the development of the BRDF research the two

are clearly dependent and complementary.<BR>

<BR>

Related Talks were: [2-1], [2-2], [2-3], [2-6], [2-7], [2-8], [3-1], [3-2],

[3-3], [3-4], [3-5], [3-6], [3-8], [3-9] and [4-1].<BR>

<H4>3.5 Remotely Sensed Data</H4>

<BR>

There were many data types discussed. These ranged from the use of existing

data types, such as aerial photography, Landsat TM, AVHRR and airborne data

(such as Daedalus data) to simulations of the emerging data types such as

POLDER, MISR and MODIS.<BR>

<BR>

Quite a variety of airborne instruments exist now which can obviously be

used for research as well as for their prime objective as development tools

for space borne instruments. These include ASAS, the POLDER simulator and

MISR Airborne Simulator (MAS). These can be regarded separately as tools

for mapping just as the final spaceborne tools will be. Their advantages

are those of airborne data - flexible deployment, control over calibration

and ancillary data.<BR>

<BR>

Papers discussion these include: [1-6], [1-7], [1-8], [3-2], [3-3], [3-4],

[3-5], [3-8] and [3-9].<BR>

<H4>3.6 Scale</H4>

<BR>

There were many ranges of scale presented at the workshop. Information was

obtained and models discussed for the sub-millimetre scale of ice crystals,

through soil grain, leaf, branch, crown and canopy up to AVHRR scale. It

seemed to be unquestioned that BRDF and Hotspot effects translated easily

through these scale changes.<BR>

<BR>

I believe the area of BRDF and Hotspot effects is perhaps almost unique

in the way its significant invariants do transfer across scales. Yet it

is not all so easy. There are many issues of scale that are as yet neglected.

Relationships between phase functions for the 'grains' listed above and

those of the components making them up have no complete theory and this

is a major challenge. Not wanting to push a barrow necessarily, I would

mention that this scaling undoubtedly involves at least spatial variance

and correlations and that the 'mean' effects we call BRDF and the Hotspot

are not themselves sufficient to describe the scaling.<BR>

<BR>

There were papers involving many scales but none on 'scale'. There was one

which discussed variance [2-4].<BR>

<H4>3.7 The Hunter and the Dog</H4>

<BR>

Juhan Ross pointed out that in Estonia in the forestry and ecology 'hunts'

it has been traditional to regard the Forester or Ecologist as the Hunter

and the physicist as the Dog. However, he noted that the traditional forestry

and ecology cannot handle the information our science is able to provide

nor cope with the scales we can encompass. He claimed that in radiation

ecology it is time for the physicist to become the Hunter and the Dog.<BR>

<BR>

I agree. In other cases we have for years been asked by climate modellers

and others to provide crude summarising parameters for models whose handling

of the radiation fields would make any remote sensing specialist weep. Our

science is moving into data spaces unknown to our 'Hunter' buddies. It is

time to hunt down what <I>we</I> can find out about the world that no one

else can reach and then also drop it on their clean boots with wagging tails!<BR>

<H3>4. The Closing Discussion of September 18</H3>

<BR>

The following discussion is an expansion of the set of notes provided and

taken by Alan Strahler as Chair and facilitator of this important discussion.

He is thanked for the privilege he gave me to use his notes but is not to

blame for the [embellishments].

<H4><BR>

4.1 Initial Discussion Starter.<BR>

</H4>

<B>4.1.1 Why Study BRDF in Remote Sensing?</B><BR>

<BR>

(i) Improve understanding of physical scattering mechanisms of surface covers

and interaction with soil and atmosphere;<BR>

<BR>

(ii) Retrieval of surface parameters by inversion. But which parameters?

See below ...<BR>

<BR>

[Maybe not just inversion but also by interpretation and pattern recognition]<BR>

<BR>

(iii) Correction of angular effects in imagery allowing users to make their

own inferences.<BR>

<BR>

[Users often want to apply image processing to mosaics. Image processing

implies spatial stationarity which angular variations disrupt. We need the

make the data at least 'quasi-stationary]<BR>

<BR>

Key Problem: &quot; ... the main limiting factor remains - obtained by remote

sensing, vegetation parameters quite poorly express the main biological

processes - photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, allocation etc of

growing vegetation.&quot; (Juhan Ross)<BR>

<BR>

That is, Radiation Parameters are not the same as Ecological Parameters.<BR>

<BR>

[However, Ross has the view that the fault is not with RS but there needs

to be a re-appraisal of measurement models on both the ecological and remote

sensing sides. That is, it is time the Dog became the Hunter and the Dog.

This is not just the case in vegetation cover. Linking the user scene measurement/descriptive

model with the radiative scene measurement/descriptive model is the Key

issue in most applications.]<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.1.2 What is Needed?</B><BR>

<BR>

Models:	Not a problem<BR>

		Inversion strategies can use improvement<BR>

<BR>

[There was not complete agreement here. Bernard Pinty, the Modeller's Modeller

(i.e. a Modeller who is such a Modeller that even Modellers call him a Modeller),

felt that better models are still needed. Personally, I think the current

models are advanced enough and are not what is pushing the boundary. It

is a common statement in water radiation models and atmosphere radiation

models that the current limitations are not in the models but in our knowledge

of the physical parameters and properties that are needed to run the models.

Land models are not as well established but the statement is, I think, the

same. Better <I>Inversion</I> theory, of course, can provide many of these

properties in addition to the scene parameters.]<BR>

<BR>

Data:		&quot;Point&quot; measurements for model development and validation<BR>

			Lab:	Leaf scattering measurements<BR>

				Goniometric measurements of targets<BR>

			Field:	Goniometric measurements of real targets in the <BR>

				atmosphere<BR>

		&quot;Area&quot; measurements to extend information spatially<BR>

			Field campaigns, aircraft data<BR>

			Satellite data - AVHRR, POLDER, MODIS, MISR &amp;<BR>

			Spot-Vegetation<BR>

<BR>

[Measurement and Validation issues are a major issue and provide the current

challenge. At all stages and scales it is also important to introduce the

correct environmental information so that the radiation scene models and

the user scene models can be related. For example, are leaf measurements

useful without pigment and high spectral data measurements? Can fluorescence

data provide the link? In each case above there is an issue of standardisation

and information cataloguing. What is the minimal data set and descriptors

such that the data can be used by others? What standardisation is needed

in measurement techniques as well as information recording? Is a field reflectance

useful if (at least) the fraction of diffuse radiation is not recorded?

Is a leaf scattering reading useful if leaf absorption spectrum and/or fluorescence

spectrum is/are not recorded?]<BR>

<BR>

Mechanisms		

<BLOCKQUOTE>Sharing models?<BR>

Sharing Data?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

[The above applies. There need to be common bases for model and data comparison

and validation. Perhaps there are standard targets which can be used to

test instruments and standard scenes to test models. But how do you adequately

define and parametrise these? The suggestion is recorded later for some

form of email discussion area. Maybe a listserver is a good start. However,

perhaps a full Web Site is what is needed with pointers to data owners and

sites, model owners and sites plus a compendium of proposed standards and

methods for model and field analysis. The EOC is starting such a beast.

For people who are not on the internet, an HTML version could be supplied

regularly by diskette for off-line browsing!]<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.1.3 What's Next for This Workshop?</B><BR>

<BR>

Biennial Meetings?<BR>

		1998 in ISPRA or Toulouse<BR>

<BR>

[I suggest also that the regular slot at IGARSS be maintained as a continuity

placer meeting. This plus the 'Web' site may be enough to keep the Beijing

momentum going forward.]

<H4><BR>

4.2 General Discussion</H4>

<BR>

The general discussion that followed was recorded in point form by Alan

Strahler. I have repeated the points with some expansion but usually without

[embellishment] as I remember them from the time. Where a change may change

the meaning I have recorded it in [brackets]. In addition, I have re-ordered

the points and collected them under a number of headings reflecting my viewpoint

and interests.<BR>

<BR>

[The classification arises from my way of describing what most of the modellers

and measurers are going through. That is, they decide on a 'grain' for their

objects, define a set of properties or functions attributable to the grains

and arrangement and geometric properties attributable to the collection

of grains. The complete system is the scene model. This &quot;grain&quot;

model must be relatable to both the radiation model and the user model of

the world if the activity is to be completely successful. When they go out

to measure the world, the relationship between the measurements and this

scene model is the measurement model. If the data are to be useful there

must be a good base measurement model.<BR>

<BR>

For example, in plant canopies, you must decide if you are working at the

leaf and stem level, the 'shoot' or 'module' level, or whether you can start

at the crown level, or stand level or community level. Foresters tend to

think of forests as collections of tree trunks with aggregate basal areas

and stem size distributions and make appropriately scaled measurements,

but ecologists have a bit more flexibility. Crop modelling is usually best

done at the leaf and stem level although recent data suggest the architecture

of the way these group on plants is also of significance for modelling.<BR>

<BR>

In each case, if you are an ecologist, for example, you must ensure the

description is rich enough in scene model grain and measurement model scale

to accommodate the outputs of interest such as CO2 flux, water flux or energy

balance components. It must be powerful enough to accommodate dynamics (such

as succession) if this is the objective. For the remote sensor, it must

be equally flexible and sufficient if these outputs are the objectives but

it must particularly be sufficient to describe the radiation <I>measurement</I>

model and link to the sensor <I>measurement</I> model.<BR>

<BR>

The relationship between the user scene model and the radiation scene model

involves measurement scale. The measurement scale may be finer or coarser

than the user scene model and this relationship is important for choice

of analytical approach. In the Strahler et al. terminology, the radiation

measurement model may be (Low) L- or (High) H-resolution relative to the

scene model.<BR>

<BR>

Using these ideas, the points people have made are collected under four

headings:<BR>

<BR>

1. Relationships Between User and Radiation Models<BR>

<BR>

2. Tools for Measurement of Properties &amp; Structure<BR>

<BR>

3. Radiation Measurement Models &amp; Inversion<BR>

<BR>

4. Infrastructure Issues<BR>

<BR>

The collection 1. is of special significance and is the longest. It includes

how to describe the scene as well as the issues of Standards, User Viewpoints

and User Attitudes. Typical management views in some of the programs may

reflect user views and question whether BRDF based methods really work,

whether there are too many models and too few products and complain that

there are too few standards and less quality control. What are the products?<BR>

<BR>

Bernard Pinty made the suggestion that it is too early for standards. I

fear that if it is too early then it is already too late.<BR>

<BR>

As a final category I have listed Infrastructure Issues. These are things

we can do as a &quot;BRDF Community&quot; to take things forward.]<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.2.1 Relationships Between User and Radiation Models</B><BR>

<BR>

Sig Gerstl: Parameter match must be made. Ecologists see the [same] &quot;sun&quot;

for their applications. We need to locate the same phenomena that give the

biological effect and the radiation effect. Canopy architecture is an overlap

area. We need structure-based vegetation classifications.<BR>

<BR>

Andres Kuusk: Chemical composition of leaves from spectral measurements

is [an] overlap area.<BR>

<BR>

[An optical classification exists based on pigments. Is it as discriminating

as the optical classification for algae in water quality modelling and measurement?]<BR>

<BR>

Tiit Nilson: The ground [model] has plant communities involving spatial

distributions and patterns which depend on scale. At small scales they may

be regular and at large scales clumped. Also, the mutual influences of plants

are important but rarely used in models. [Tiit suggested that these relationships

would help the over-parameterised models.]<BR>

<BR>

DLBJ: In ecology there are a range of models for succession called 'Gap

Models' which are based on an effectively continuous canopy with 'holes'.

These should be able to be modelled and used to interpret broad scale images.

The individual trees are not actually considered.<BR>

<BR>

Xiang Yueqin: It is important to develop descriptions of structure of the

different types of crop such as wheat and corn. We need to work out how

to scale structure. There is a problem in measurement at points due to different

types, times of planting etc. Need to characterise the variance for agricultural

applications.<BR>

<BR>

Bernard Pinty: Connecting radiation with ecology. For example, with LAI

it has been mostly done from spectral data. There is [apparently] no need

for angular data. But what is the error in LAI? We can get LAI by inversion

[of BRDF] but in the end this will only reduce error which may not be very

interesting to the end users. We need to develop more [unique outputs].

Eg LAI+Structure+... For combined wavelength we have the same [structural]

parameters, the same state variables so there is a lot more information

but a more difficult inference.<BR>

<BR>

DLBJ: Sophisticated scene and measurement models for remote sensing have

often had to deliver simple products for less sophisticated biophysical

models - eg SEB. But this is changing. The demands from modellers are becoming

more sophisticated and spatial variation in CO2, water and energy fluxes

are being tackled by modellers. Demands for better products will come. We

must anticipate these requests for structural data and have the answers

ready.<BR>

<BR>

Wolfgang Wanner: About the &quot;gap&quot;. Remote sensing provides a huge

knowledge [base] about the Earth's vegetation and spatial structure. So

maybe RS can help extend ecologists thinking to scales they cannot reach

with plot data. For example, a new LC classification based on BRDF and the

way large areas green up etc.<BR>

<BR>

Phillip Lewis: Remotely sensed information may often be at the wrong scale.

Ecologists often need fine scale information.<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: Scale is a problem. Now ecologists are interested in detailed

information such as process studies, stomatal closure for CO2 etc.<BR>

<BR>

[Why is everyone forgetting airborne data? Multi-spectral, multi-angle data

with pixels &lt; 1 metre is no problem!]<BR>

<BR>

Sig Gerstl: Why do we limit ourselves? We should be extending the ecologists

point of view. This is the &quot;Pretty Picture&quot; syndrome. We should

now be extending the view using polarisation and detecting stress at a global

scale. First signs of stress are not spectral but wilting - structural changes.<BR>

<BR>

Alfred Chang: Microwave may be more sensitive to such stress. Physics unites

all our science. The same equations but different approximations. We need

to study detection efficiency.<BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: Ecologists cannot help us. We need to educate ourselves as to

what is needed and how to get it. [We must be both Hunter and Dog].<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: Do we need any more models?<BR>

<BR>

DLBJ: Maybe we have enough models and what we really need are some standards?<BR>

<BR>

Sig Gerstl: We need a 'super-model' of the standard models structured by

application.<BR>

<BR>

Bernard Pinty: Maybe we need more data. It is too early for standards.<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: We are not focussed clearly on a product. LAI at a global scale

has a focus which BRDF does not have yet. Even then different models are

needed for different areas.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.2.2 Tools for Measurement of Properties &amp; Structure</B><BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: Need to make use of the forward scattered light to increase

spectral information.<BR>

<BR>

[Maybe it is almost mandatory to measure reflectance and transmittance of

translucent materials. It is certainly the case that only measuring leaf

reflectance of Australian trees misses more than half the information]<BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: Need to add other regions of the spectrum - microwave, thermal

etc. In microwave the is information about [the same] leaves, stems etc.

and no cloud problem. We need medium sized goniometric apparatus for Shoot

measurements and bridge the gap between leaf and canopy. This could use

a laser beam. Maybe this would cost about $300K.<BR>

<BR>

Prof. Kawata: Polarised light is important now that scanning polarised sensors

are becoming available. Need ground and vegetation measurements to support

POLDER.<BR>

<BR>

Shunlin Liang: Canopy polarisation is 2-3% but soils polarise to 10-15%

so may be more important than vegetation as an opportunity for POLDER.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.2.3 Radiation Measurement Models &amp; Inversion</B><BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: For architecture, the use of fractals and L-Systems should be

increased.<BR>

<BR>

Shunlin Liang: Can BRDF help in remote sensing of water and soils?<BR>

<BR>

DLBJ: In remote sensing of water the angular distribution of the emerging

radiation field is highly indicative of water properties - especially in

more turbid waters. Clumps of algae or other particles have a strong effect

known as the 'Packet' effect in water literature.<BR>

<BR>

Xu Xiru: Need to use thermal infrared data. The question is how to use it?

Need Effective Emissivity (thermal BRDF) models [the models need to be effective

as well!]. This is significant in CO2 flux.<BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: Need to connect TIR data to the heat balance and surface energy

balance.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.2.5 Infrastructure Issues</B><BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: Next meeting we should invite microwave specialist[s].<BR>

<BR>

Alan Strahler: Lets invite water people to the next meeting.<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: Being pragmatic - lets get people from the ecological community

here to talk about structure - perhaps a &quot;Tutorial&quot;.<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: There is an email based &quot;Plant Canopy Network&quot;. Do

we want to develop an internet network? May need special funding for someone

to manage it. Can start with a User Group on the internet.<BR>

<BR>

[The issues raised are clearly ones we must cooperate to resolve. We all

need to consider the end users and 'markets' as a common area to develop

and we must all display the quality we know our work can provide. When the

demand is there we can all compete as to who can meet it best or most efficiently

or for the lowest cost - but until it exists our competition is probably

destructive. The development of a network for the BRDF community is a very

important step and regular meetings are an equally important step. A lot

of ground was covered in this Meeting and quite a lot was turned over as

well. I look forward to the next.]<BR>

<HR><BR>

<B>Project Review</B><BR>

<BR>

Martha Maiden spoke about the commercialisation of NASA. Funding for the

1km project has not been affected as NASA &amp; IGBP are highly supportive

of the project. The pathfinder program provides stability.<BR>

<BR>

Alessandra Buongiorno, representing the ESA stations described their current

operation. ESA is using LAS/ADAPS and providing stitched orbit data to the

USGS, and vice versa. Archiving on optical tape. <BR>

<BR>

Kevin Gallo - NOAA 's contribution is to ensure the recorders are scheduled.

This data is free to the USGS now.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Project Status Reports &amp; Data Acquisition (USGS)<BR>

<BR>

</B>Data comes from Tokyo university via ftp now, ~3 scenes per day. Possibility

of faster link from Australia to USA via Japan?<BR>

<BR>

Data from October 1993 to September 1994 will not be used for global composites

due to the Southern hemisphere being in darkness. The passes are, however,

stitched &amp; archived. <BR>

<BR>

All of the 10 day composites for April 92 - September 93 should be finished

by the end of September this year. The data will be circulated, approximately

200 tapes worth. Stitching of NOAA14 orbits will begin also in September,

using data as of 1 February 1995.<BR>

<BR>

New atmospheric corrections have been published by John R Townshend, &quot;

A version 2 AVHRR multi-resolution land pathfinder data set &quot;.<BR>

<BR>

NOAA 14 status:<BR>

- correct calibration coefficients from NOASIS web site<BR>

- thermal channels affected by seeing sunlight in the calibrating &quot;space-look&quot;

, gain calculations affected.<BR>

</UL>

<BR>

<B>Science Requirements &amp; Extension of Project</B><BR>

<BR>

Martha Maiden stated that NASA envisioned the project continuing indefinitely,

perhaps becoming more stabilised with time. The EROS Data Centre has strong

support for the project as part of Mission to Planet Earth. All parties

agreed to continue until September 1998 ( by which time the 1996 data should

be processed ). Information on anyone using the global product, or any other

science requirements should be fed back to NASA or EDC.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Data Processing / Product Distribution<BR>

<BR>

</B>EDC intends to get a global data set of control points due to errors

in the DCW. Interest in Australia's MSS mosaic. <BR>

<BR>

NOAA provides quality assessment of the Global product by comparing NDVI

with 8km NDVI.<BR>

<BR>

Information re the global composites is currently taking 4 to 7 months to

go online (IMS limitations).<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<B>NOAA Update</B> (Dan Tarpley)<BR>

<BR>

Dan outlined the changes with the NOAA K, L, M series: 

<UL>

  <LI>additional / replacement sensors 

  <LI>calibration changes in reflectance channels 

  <LI>1.6 &amp; 3.7 micron channel (1km group should vote in the time-sharing)

  <LI>new launch policy (on failure of previous satellite) 

  <LI>better launch rocket by NOAA L 

  <LI>NPOESS to take over ~ 2008 

</UL>

<BR>

<B>1-KM Data Set Projects, Applications, and Related Platforms</B>

<UL>

  <LI>SPOT VEGETATION Update (Gilbert Saint, JRC)<BR>

The products from the Vegetation instruments (Veg-1 &amp; Veg-2) will be

distributed by SPOT at a minimal cost. Veg-1 should begin operation in 1997,

Veg-2 in 2002. L-band reception may be free, with some charge for correction

parameters.<BR>

<BR>

  <LI>National Snow &amp; Ice Data Centre (Ted Scambos &amp; Todd Hutchinson)<BR>

NSIDC collects &amp; composites data over the poles to create products such

as albedo, surface temperature, sea-ice movement. Discussed the problems

of rapid local time changes across the poles.<BR>

<BR>

  <LI>AVHRR Calibration (Eric Vermote, University of Maryland)<BR>

Near real-time calibration using ocean and cloud views. Ratio of ch1/ch2

over the pacific ocean, where aerosol contribution is negligible, in the

presence of high altitude thick cloud (considered spectrally flat). Ozone

can be accurately measured (TOVS, SeaWIFs) thus effects due to Rayleigh

scattering can be isolated. The process currently has a 9 day turnaround.<BR>

<BR>

  <LI>AVHRR Global Fire Product (Jackie Kendal, NASA)<BR>

Fire Algorithm Working Group, NGSFC. See IGBP-DIS home page.<BR>

The objective is to provide a standard global fire product. So far have

produced a prototype data set from Global AVHRR 1km product (June 25 1992)

and are validating it against DMSP &amp; GOES data, high resolution satellite

data, and results from field experiments (SAFARI, SCAR(s), EXPRESSO, Firescan).

Hope to publish the first product March 97, on cdrom. <BR>

<BR>

  <LI>NOAA Urban Heat Island Project (Kevin Gallo, NOAA)<BR>

Using NDVI and DMSP OLS. Results: a heat island bias is likely to be present

in the observed temperatures for stations with a lower NDVI than their surrounding

landscapes. 

</UL>

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Discussion<BR>

<BR>

</B>All present reaffirmed continuation of the project. Another meeting

is expected to be held before next (Northern) summer. <BR>

<BR>

Kevin Gallo advised of the next NOAA meeting, on satellite applications,

March 4 - 6, North Carolina. Details at NOAA's website ( http://www.noaa.gov).<BR>

<HR>

<H2>Poes User's Symposium</H2>

<H3>Fourth international satellite direct broadcast services symposium for

NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES).<BR>

Annapolis, Md, USA June 10 - 12 1996</H3>

<HR><B>Symposium Themes</B> 

<UL>

  <LI>To inform users of current and future plans of US and international

polar satellite systems 

  <LI>To discuss the changes in NOAA's upcoming satellites (NOAA K, L &amp;

M), including changes in their direct broadcast systems. 

</UL>

<HR>The U.S. Congress has reaffirmed &quot;free access&quot; to the data.

There has been a significant increase in the number of amateur users of

the data.<BR>

<BR>

Currently NOAA 14 is the primary afternoon satellite &amp; NOAA 12 is the

primary morning satellite.<BR>

<BR>

The Search &amp; Rescue Processor (SARP) on NOAA 14 has been inoperative

since launch. The backup computer failed.<BR>

<BR>

The next series of satellites, NOAA K to N will be the fifth generation

of NOAA satellites. The changes include: 

<UL>

  <LI>the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and Stratospheric Sounding Unit

(SSU) will be discontinued 

  <LI>the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, AMSU-A &amp; AMSU-B will be

added 

  <LI>the AVHRR/2 has been updated (to AVHRR/3) by adding a sixth channel

at 1.6 microns. It will be known as channel 3A; channel 3B corresponds to

ch3 of the AVHRR/2 instrument. These two channels will be operated alternately,

3A during the day &amp; 3B at night, although there was much discussion

of this during the meeting. Due to limited bandwidth A &amp; B cannot be

operated simultaneously. The use of data compression is being examined.

  <LI>additional sunshield for calibration, more solar panels, extra instruments

= increased weight of satellite 

  <LI>HIRS/2 replaced by HIRS/3 - a change in the calibration sequence.

  <LI>increased data transmission rate (1200 to 2560 bits/sec). 

  <LI>after NOAA K, command encryption will be used. 

</UL>

<BR>

With these changes the stored and real-time data formats have changed. For

details see <A HREF="http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/noaasis.html">http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/noaasis.html</A><BR>

<BR>

<BR>

NOAA K may be launched sometime in 1997, but could be much later. Launch

dates will be dependent on failure of operating satellite for this series.

Some discussion of what &quot;failure&quot; meant, as in the case of NOAA

11 where the decayed orbit rendered much of the Earth observation data unusable.<BR>

<BR>

NOAA &amp; Eumetsat plan a joint polar program beginning 2001. NOAA to provide

afternoon spacecraft (NOAA N &amp; N'), Eumetsat to provide morning spacecraft

(METOP-1 &amp; -2). The METOP satellites will carry the same instruments

as the NOAA series, with additional European instruments.<BR>

<BR>

Eumetsat is developing a standard software package (EARP - Eumetsat ATOVS

Retrieval System) for processing locally received ATOVS &amp; AVHRR data

from the HRPT stream of the NOAA K, L, M satellites, and the future METOPs.

It is a combined effort between Meteo France, KNMI, UK Met Office, DWD,

ECMWF and ARA/LMD. This software will be freely available.<BR>

<BR>

There is a planned convergence of the NOAA POES program and DMSP, to become

the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).

It will be a co-operative effort between the Dept of Commerce, the Dept

of Defence, and NASA. This has been prompted by US budget savings, and was

directed by the President in 1994.<BR>

<BR>

The increased use of radio frequencies is creating interference between

the metsats &amp; other users. The World Radio Administrative Conference

(WRAC) in 1992 allocated two bands used by APT &amp; HRPT to the Mobile

Satellite Service (MSS). NOAA is monitoring the situation.<BR>

<BR>

Applications of POES data were presented at the symposium, including biomass

burning and aerosol detection, snow applications, coastal zone hazards and

the Global 1km project.<BR>

<BR>

Some educational programs in earth observation systems and satellite technology

were described. <BR>

Meetings with scientists<BR>

</B><BR>

A series of meetings was held during the week to discuss joint scientific

programs based on the analysis and applications of ATSR data. More details

on these meetings are available on request. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Albin Zavody</I></B> - Discussed the new SST and cloud-clearing algorithms

for the re-analysis of ATSR data. A paper was under preparation detailing

the new cloud-clearing scheme. Differences between ATSR and ATSR-2 data

products were discussed and methods for investigating these differences

evolved. New data files were obtained to extend the RAL atmospheric transmission

model to wider spectral bands in the near and thermal infrared. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Chris Mutlow</I></B> - Discussed future validation plans including

the possible use of Australian waters for international campaigns. The collaboration

with Iwate University at Mutsu Bay in North Japan had suffered from persistent

cloud cover and some logistic problems. Chris was also taking over from

I Barton as the Chairman of the CEOS IVOS sub-group (see below) and details

of the hand-over were arranged. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Phil Watts</I></B> - Phil is planning to spend some time at DAR in

the near future and possible research programs were investigated. These

must fit in with his responsibilities and research activities at RAL as

well as with the programs at DAR. Fred Prata is the point of contact at

DAR. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Myles Allen </I></B>- Discussions on the applications of altimeter

data in oceanography including techniques for combining ATSR and ALT data.

We also talked about future techniques for the best analysis of ATSR data.

It was agreed that the best techniques were probably those detailed in my

recent paper just submitted to JGR. Copies of this paper were left at RAL.

<BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Ryuzo Yokoyama</I></B> - While I was at RAL Professor Yokoyama was

also visiting so we talked about the Mutsu Bay campaigns as well as the

possibility of Yokoyama attending the series of meetings being set up for

Townsville in April 1997. If he attended these meeting he would try and

bring a high resolution infrared camera to obtain some coincident measurements

with the AIMS radiometer installed on the wave-piercing ferry. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Tim Nightingale</I></B> - Tim has built a new infrared radiometer

for SST validation and had used it at Mutsu Bay. The new radiometer was

inspected and provided some possible modifications to the CSIRO models.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Data requests<BR>

</B><BR>

ATSR-2 data were requested for Fred Prata to cover two volcanic eruptions

as well as the data for the DC-8 campaign over the Hay and Amburla test

sites. <BR>

<BR>

A request was lodged for full mission Australian continental coverage for

ATSR-1 data. This request would be forwarded to NERC and we are waiting

for a response. It is likely that this request will be filled when ESA and

RAL start their full ATSR reprocessing program. <BR>

<BR>

RAL also agreed to forward some ABT files as soon as they were available.

These files are required to enable continuation of the ATSR water vapour

derivation studies. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Other contacts<BR>

<BR>

<I>David Llewellyn-Jones (Leicester Uni)</I></B> - Phone discussions regarding

plans for AATSR meetings in Townsville during April 1997. A draft notice

was formulated and has been circulated to likely attendees. The notice is

included as Attachment 1. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Cathy Johnson (UK DoE)</I></B> - Cathy is replacing Peter Mallaburn

as the DoE person in charge of the AATSR program. A courtesy phone call

was made to introduce myself and to discuss the status of the AATSR Science

Agreement between CSIRO and DoE. Changes are required to the document since

the demise of the ASO and these would be finalised at the Townsville meeting

in April. <BR>

<B>CEOS WGCV IVOS meeting<BR>

</B><BR>

The two day meeting was chaired by Ian Barton. The minutes of this meeting

are included as attachment 2. Twelfth CEOS WGCV meeting <BR>

<BR>

This meeting was attended as the Australian representative on this Working

Group. The minutes of this meeting will be available in due course. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Significant Items<BR>

</B><BR>

Two significant actions were discussed at the CEOS meetings involving the

intercomparison of data from different satellite instruments using a particular

ground test site. These activities could extend to other test sites in the

future. <BR>

<BR>

The Libyan Desert was selected as the land-based test site and Chris Mutlow

at RAL was to coordinate the collection of data over this site for a selected

time period. The results of this activity would be discussed at the next

IVOS meeting. <BR>

<BR>

Ian Barton suggested the Townsville wave-piercing ferry transect as an ocean

based test site. This has now (Jan. 1997) been agreed with William Skirving

at AIMS and Chris Mutlow at RAL. A fixed time period would be selected to

collect data over this site - probably in mid-1997 to provide cloud-free

conditions and time to ensure that the collection of good ground-truth data

was possible. <BR>

<BR>

DRAFT PLAN FOR TOWNSVILLE MEETINGS - APRIL 1997 <BR>

</B><BR>

Dear All<BR>

<BR>

Herewith is a draft plan for meetings in Townsville next April. Can you

please let me know if you can make these meetings and whether there are

others who should be invited (David, Should you pass this on to all the

AATSR SAG, - especially the ESA members?). William Skirving has agreed to

look after some of the local arrangements and we will advise of hotels and

meeting places when we have an idea of the number of participants. <BR>

<BR>

I hope you can all make it! Regards, Ian. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Draft Plan for AATSR-Related Meetings in Townsville - April 1997 <BR>

</B><BR>

Below is a list of possible attendees at a series of meetings to be held

in Townsville during the week of 7 - 11 April 1997. Any comments on the

proposed meetings, the list of attendees and the times allowed will be most

welcome. <BR>

<BR>

The meeting schedule will allow for travel to Townsville on Monday afternoon

to give a full day for meetings on the first 2 days. The best ATSR-2 pass

is on Thursday 10 April (Sunday 13 is better - but too late) so we will

all participate in a validation exercise on that day. Please let me know

if you will be able to bring a radiometer on the Field Excursion to the

Barrier Reef. <BR>

<BR>

Please let me know if you are likely to attend these meetings and whether

there are others in your institute that may attend. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Welcome<BR>

</B><BR>

On behalf of DLR and DARA Wolfgang Noack welcomed the participants in the

IVOS meeting and explained the logistics of the meeting and associated activities.

<BR>

<BR>

Introductions went round the room and the Chairman passed on regrets and

apologies from Karl Staenz, Allan Hollinger, Wayne Boncyk (who was represented

by Dennis Helder), Masanobu Shimada and Zhimin Zhang. <BR>

<BR>

The Chairman noted that it was unfortunate that no one from NASA was attending

as the dossier is a key component in IVOS plans and activities. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Objectives/Agenda<BR>

</B><BR>

The Chairman outlined the agenda items and suggested that an important component

of the day's activities was to ensure that the Dossier compilation and maintenance

was progressing well. The second day's sessions would include presentations

from the National Physics Lab. in the UK and a special session on the validation

of future satellite instruments. <BR>

<BR>

The agenda was accepted without modification. <BR>

<BR>

The Chairman informed the meeting that he was standing down as Chair and

that Chris Mutlow had accepted the offer to become the new Chair. The Chairman

thanked all the IVOS participants for their contributions over the past

five years and seven meetings and wished Chris all the best in his new role.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Review of Minutes from Previous Meeting <BR>

</B><BR>

The Chairman reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. He noted that

the two recommendations presented to the plenary were accepted with modification

and some discussion. The recommendation that ``satellite operators provide

reliable on-board calibration'' was discussed and Plenary asked for the

recommendation to be more specific with a definition of on-board calibration.

For test sites the action is on WGCV members to go back to their agencies

and propose international test sites and to foster the use of the proposed

test sites. <BR>

<BR>

Much discussion about this topic centred on the fact that CEOS doesn't provide

any funds for activities and thus, what kind of recommendations WGCV can

make? Alan Belward noted that if IVOS developed recommendations with greater

specificity then the plenary and sponsoring agencies may be more likely

to accept and support the recommendations. Kumar asked what the criteria

for a CEOS-endorsed test site is? Garth Morgan suggested that the sites

listed in the dossier should be considered CEOS- endorsed, although funding

to maintain the sites (e.g. collection and archiving of ground data, etc)

will have to come from each agency. Mike Rast suggested that the dossier

is compiled for information purposes and that some effort needs to go into

selecting test sites and developing cross-calibration plans, etc.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Review of Action Items<BR>

<BR>

</B><U>IVOS-3-1</U>. Still open - but will be replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-1

with a reminder that all IVOS members should notify the WGCV Secretariat

with information on new campaigns and instruments. Alan Belward says that

when the information is available it should be emailed and hosted on or

linked to the CEOS-WGCV web page. <BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-4-6</U>. Outstanding. Will be replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-6. <BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-1.</U> Closed. The Chairman commented that he welcomed the attendance

of Guiseppe Zibordi and other Ocean Colour folks as this will help with

the co-ordination of their activities. He also suggested that it was unrealistic

for agencies to send more than one or two representatives to IVOS meetings

and it was thus the responsibility of those attending to represent their

agencies interests in a wider range of cal/val activities than their own

special areas of interest.<BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-2</U>. Outstanding. Will be replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-2. At present

there is a limited number of test sites on the Dossier and a special effort

would be made to ensure that this component of the Dossier was expanded.

<BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-3.</U> Outstanding. Replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-2. <BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-4.</U> Closed. <BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-5.</U> Closed. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Report from Plenary<BR>

</B><BR>

The new Chairman of WGCV (Alan Belward) briefly reviewed the results of

the plenary meeting. A key item is that the affiliates now have a mandate

for greater participation in CEOS working groups. The plenary wants to know

what the consequences of the recommendations will be on the working groups.

WGCV is encouraged to address cal/val recommendations emanating from the

Sept 96 In-situ Observations for Global Observing Systems, Geneva. These

recommendations were directed towards the end user and geophysical (derived)

data sets, and contained fundamental cal/val issues. Rao stated that we

should stay away from algorithm specifications and focus more on basic sensor

calibration and radiance. Phil Teillet however noted that the funding reality

is that the focus needs to be on end-user product validation. Rao argued

that only operational algorithms should be considered for validation - experimental

algorithms being too unbounded.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Agency/Country Reports<BR>

</B><BR>

Chris Mutlow - RAL, UK. ATSR-2 has been resurrected and has been operational

for some time. ATSR-2 calibration has been confirmed and validated using

several methods including: <BR>

<BR>

on-board calibration <BR>

<BR>

vicarious calibration - desert sites <BR>

<BR>

vicarious calibration - deep convective clouds <BR>

<BR>

GOME comparisons <BR>

<BR>

sunglint <BR>

<BR>

All methods confirmed ATSR-2 pre-flight calibration except 1.6 micron channel

which was off by a factor of 1.4 An error was discovered in the pre-flight

calibration calculations and the following correction results were very

good. Chris discussed the ATSR-2 instrument characterisation. They use an

on-board visible calibration which views the sun each orbit for calibration.

Using both White Sands and the Libyan desert sites has resulted in consistent

results and they have also done some cross-calibration with AVHRR measurements

over the Libyan desert sites with good results. In addition, comparisons

with aircraft underflights have been very good in the IR and good in the

vis/near IR.<BR>

<BR>

<U>Rao - NOAA, USA</U>. The new AVHRR/3 instrument will have a new channel

3a (1.58-1.64 micron) for aerosol products. This will change the basic data

formats which will impact operational processing and calibration. AVHRR/3

will also have a sun shield to limit stray light contamination. Rao reviewed

the AVHRR Libyan desert calibration noting that the values are tied to U2

aircraft underflights which minimise atmospheric contamination. All of this

information is available and kept current on the NOAA web site. Rao is also

looking at test sites in Nevada USA and the Gobi desert. Ross Mitchell from

CSIRO will be looking at desert sites in Australia. <BR>

<BR>

In ensuing discussion it was noted that spatial homogeneity, temporal and

seasonal consistency, consistent elevation, access to the site for ground-based

collaborative measurements and no BRDF contamination are important for any

vicarious calibration test site. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Phil Teillet - CCRS and IGBP</U>. The Canadian report had been submitted

in hardcopy. Phil did discuss one urgent topical issue. He noted that some

BOREAS sites may be maintained for 3 years and will be available to cal/val

activities, however others are being closed. A final decision will be made

in December and IVOS members should immediately notify Phil of any interest

in these sites. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Guiseppe Zibordi - EU</U>. Guiseppe discussed the CoASTS project - Coastal

Atmosphere and Sea Time Series project. This involved the collection of

measurements over the north Adriatic Sea to support SeaWiFS and OCTS. This

has also involved evaluating bio-fouling of underwater radiometers as well

as intercomparison of atmospheric and marine radiometers. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Oaku - NASDA, Japan</U>. ADEOS cal/val briefing. Much work is being done

on detector normalisation and characterisation. For OCTS, the on-board calibration

is being used for trend analysis only at this time; users will need to use

pre-launch information until vicarious and buoy data are available. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Mike Rast - ESA</U>. ERS; GOME cal/val is nominally complete though more

work is being done now that algorithms are changing. ENVISAT; MERIS calibration

work ongoing; they have had two additional diffuser plates developed and

will be shipped to GSFC for comparison. MERIS is also looking into options

for vicarious calibration test sites. Mike noted that a recent issue of

Remote Sensing of the Environment includes a paper of desert test sites

for optical satellites and Mike circulated a good reference book (by Kramer).

Ian noted that these should be added to the proposed CEOS WGCV bibliography.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Action:</B> Mike to circulate the study on cal/val strategies to the

IVOS group pending review of the study. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Lasse Pettersson - Norway</U>. Lasse described ALOMAR; a lidar facility

at 69N which collects year round ground-based atmospheric parameters to

study the arctic atmosphere including thermal and chemical parameters for

trend measurements. ALOMAR is collecting a long-term baseline data set as

well as campaign-specific measurements. An ALOMAR and GOME calibration exercise

is underway. They would like to use OCTS data in this work since SEAWIFS

will not be available for some time. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Dennis Helder - SDSU / EROS Data Center</U>. EROS are characterising

TM through the internal calibrator. They are looking within an orbit, in

a 30 day outgassing cycle, and through the instrument life. They have also

looked at several night scenes to identify and correct the ``memory effect''

of the calibration pulse (memory effect being up to 2 DN). EROS is also

looking at pulse decay effects. Lifetime degradation of the calibration

lamps is being investigated. Landsat 5 has lost forward scan calibration

pulses. LSAT 7 is similar to LSAT 4-5 and is scheduled for May 98 launch.

The Enhanced (?) Thematic Mapper (ETM) has a 5 % absolute radiometric accuracy

which should be double earlier TM sensors. ETM will collect sun view data

once per day and will have a full solar calibration once a month. LSAT7

processing will correct for affects identified in the earlier satellites.

<BR>

<U>Stephen Tjemkes - Eumetsat</U> Operational calibration of Meteosat: Currently

here is no onboard calibration performed for Meteosat. Since the blackbody

cannot be used. In future (Meteosat 7) the onboard blackbody calibration

can be utilised, however it is inserted into the optical path with a mirror

such that not the whole optical path can be calibrated. For the calibration

of the VIS channel aircraft observations and model calculations are used.

Since the spectral response function of the VIS channel is rather wide,

the calibration is scene dependent. Therefore, clouds, sea, vegetation and

desert (Tunisia) targets are used for the vicarious calibration. The estimated

error in the aircraft observations are 5 %. The independent calculations

by the Matrix Operator Method also shows 5 % uncertainty. <BR>

<BR>

Analysis of the calibration coefficient of the two infrared channels depicts

minor problems with the current adopted cloud detection method. The calibration

of the IR window channel relates digital counts over clear ocean areas to

radiances calculated using a radiative transfer model with SST analysis,

and ECMWF forecast data. The uncertainty in the calibration coefficient

is estimated to be 1% with a possible 1K bias in the radiance. The WV channel

calibration relates the clear sky area digital counts to radiances calculated

using a radiative transfer model adopting collocated radiosondes. Therefore

in addition to the problems with the cloud detection method, the vicarious

calibration of this channel is also dependent on the quality of the radiosonde

observations. The precision of the current calibration coefficient is about

3% with a possible 5% bias. <BR>

<BR>

Eumetsat is planning satellite intercalibration for all three channels.

For the VIS channel this involves the Meteosat 5, Meteosat 6 and where possible

the AVHRR. For the two infrared channels this involves the HIRS instrument

and AVHRR. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Calibration Test Sites and Dossier Status</B> <BR>

<BR>

Several members noted that information that had been supplied for inclusion

on the WWW was not there. Alan Belward thus suggested that we make a specific

recommendation that specific information which we have submitted be made

available on the web. Ian suggested that 10 or so sites could be identified

for immediate inclusion on the web. These should be vicarious calibration

sites. Validation sites such as Hapex, Sahel and Boreas will be addressed

later. Phil Slater suggested that vicarious calibration sites such as these

be considered level 1 sites, and product validation sites be considered

level 2. <BR>

<BR>

The following sites were identified along with those persons to be responsible

for supplying the test site information to the NASA representative who maintains

the WWW site.<BR>

<B>Action: </B>For these sites, the identified folks will get a copy of

the form off the web, send to J Butler, with a copy to Alan Belward and

the WGCV Secretariat by 1 March. These will be updated on CEOS web site

(by 1 July) and the progress of the dossier site will be monitored. Phil

Slater noted that it's important to advertise campaigns to better utilise

resources. There was some discussion about the applicability of some of

the ocean sites. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Discussion on Future Special Sessions and Activities<BR>

<BR>

An IVOS Data Set<BR>

</B><BR>

The Chairman proposed that IVOS could select 2 sites and a time period and

collect all the data available from all sensors. <BR>

<BR>

Kumar noted that if CEOS takes it up, all data should be provided free.

<BR>

<BR>

The Chairman suggested that we could start collecting data now and India

investigate the possibility of doing the work as part of taking the secretariat

in a year's time. There was then some discussion about data availability.

Alan suggests that we should identify the level of effort it would take

for compiling and analysing the data. All agreed that this should be undertaken.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Specialist Sessions<BR>

</B><BR>

Rao suggested a special session on on-board calibration systems for the

next meeting. The Airborne RS conference in Copenhagen in July 97 has a

special session/short course on imaging spectrometer calibration and correction.

Phil&nbsp;Teillet suggested that hyperspectral calibration in general should

be considered for a future session. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Phil Teillet's New Paradigm in Cal/Val</B> <BR>

<BR>

Phil started his presentation by stating that users will only use data products

if the calibration was transparent to their application. He then discussed

the spectral and spatial resolution of various instruments. For instrument

calibration there are only a few operational cases. Generally atmospheric

correction is non-operational, but requires well calibrated data and timely,

ready access to atmospheric parameters. In the past little attention has

been paid to spectral characterisation but this is required to generate

geophysical parameters from different instruments. Phil also discussed geometric

effects, viewing directions, topography, scan angle, resampling, etc. These

all have a big effect on information content. <BR>

<BR>

Users: Special users do their own preprocessing and require high accuracy.

Operational users need good cal/val for further work, but don't want to

know abut cal/val. The majority of users need stability and quality but

don't really know about cal/val. Existing algorithms do not meet the needs

of operational users. To get to the majority of users it is necessary to

be clear about what is being offered. For Remote Sensing, one needs reliability

of supply, plug and play, and data quality (consistency, quantitative and

comparable). <BR>

<BR>

A future strategy should take account of research, reference sites, demonstration,

QA focus, standardisation, accreditation and communication. Phil also suggested

that we think laterally; e.g., recommend that all future instruments include

specific common channels. Ground truth areas of 10KM x 10KM area are needed

to compensate for current problems in calibration. Data should be hyperspectral,

measured from a low altitude aircraft. Phil also introduced the Quantitative

Stability Reference (QUASAR) Concept in which hyperspectral data ($10-$15K

per flight) are collected. This would be followed by radiometric, spectral

and geometric processing of the data. Phil hopes to begin some flights in

97 and expand his activities in 98. He would then generate products (surface

reflectance and at-sensor radiance, and NDVI and biophysical) and distribute

site statistics on a CCRS web site one week post-flight. The results would

also be available as wall-to-wall data sets on CD-ROM one month post-flight.

<BR>

<BR>

For this activity the site considerations are; uniformity, flatness, and

size (10x10km). Primary sites would be in prairie grasslands in Canada and

Nevada. <BR>

<BR>

With this New Paradigm the immediate action should be on the communication

aspects. In particular web sites and the dossier should be improved and

kept current.<BR>

<BR>

Important questions to be considered are: error budget, site selection,

spatial resolution, imaging calibration, etc. Infrastructure questions are:

availability of instrument, turn-around time, who participates. Phil then

showed several images to illustrate potential sites and highlighted subtle

differences in and among sites. <BR>

<BR>

Discussion: Phil Slater endorsed this new idea as he believes the funding

for on-board calibration will soon be drying up. <BR>

<BR>

Chris Mutlow noted that many instrument characteristics will not be identifiable

without on-board calibration. Specifically, build up of condensation during

outgassing cycles can't be observed by campaigns.<BR>

<BR>

Phil Slater then asked about a joint field campaign in Nevada and several

expressed interest in participating including UK/RAL, CCRS, NASDA, and possibly

NOAA. A meeting to discuss this would be held in February next. <BR>

<BR>

<B>3rd December 1996<BR>

<BR>

Country/Agency Reports (contd<BR>

<BR>

</B><U>China</U>. The Chairman read the highlights of the China country

report which was submitted by Zhimin Zhang who was unable to attend due

to problems with getting a Visa. The full report would be placed on the

WGCV site on the WWW. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Presentations by NPL, UK<BR>

<BR>

<I>David Robinson and Nigel Fox - UK National Standards Laboratory. <BR>

</I></B><BR>

David Robinson gave an introduction to NPL - it is the UK's NMI (National

Measurement Institute - any country's official measurements institute).

NPL has about 600 scientists, more than 95 years in operation and maintains

all 7 SI units (Kg Mt Sec K Amp Candela Mole). NMIs establish international

equivalence of standards as well as R &amp;D contracting and technology

transfer. <BR>

<BR>

Scope of NPL's space measurement activities: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Optical thermal instruments, <BR>

<BR>

RF/microwave/millimetre wave, <BR>

<BR>

time and frequency, <BR>

<BR>

problem solving and other measurement services. <BR>

<BR>

Importance of space standards; continuity, traceability, and terrestrial

equivalence. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

Nigel Fox started his presentation by discussing Accuracy vs Precision;

accuracy is how well a measurement is known compared to an internationally

agreed standard or scale while precision is how well a measurement can be

repeated. Accuracy is less than precision but accuracy enables different

instrument measurements to be compared, allows long term validity of data

sets, and enables compatibility with other terrestrial data (e.g. ground-

based radiometers equivalent to space-based, and finally reduces room for

argument. E.g. fibre optic power showing that calibration efforts have resulted

in much higher accuracy. Nigel explained the standards verification and

traceability process and how the measurements are filtered out to the user

community. <BR>

<BR>

Limitations to accuracy are that the NSL does not understand user-specific

requirements,, and space scientist don't understand options available from

NSL and of course time and budgets are always limited. The various assumptions

made in the interpretation of optical measurements from space using pre-flight

and in-flight calibration (TIR black body, VIS/NIR Lamp &amp; Diffuser)

were listed. Solar calibration and vicarious methods were then discussed.

Steps to obtaining a calibration baseline from a National Standards Lab

and the sources of error in this calibration information from irradiance

scales, BRDF, etc were then described. NPL have developed a new technique

to reduce errors and improve dissemination of calibration to the community.

This involved reducing uncertainty using a new radiance standard (using

a new cryogenic radiometer) and reducing the length of the calibration chain.

Nigel provided details on current calibration methods in use. <BR>

<BR>

Direct radiance measurements using filter radiometers for both VIS/NIR and

TIR have been shown to reduce measurement errors. These transfer radiometers

are portable, robust, vacuum compatible, quick and cheap, and highly accurate.

One drawback is that the number of channels available can be limited. This

was followed by a discussion of accuracy of field calibration and options

for field calibration. <BR>

<BR>

Discussion: Availability; the portable calibration standard for visible

is available now, depending on the specific channels requested. NRL can

also calibrate participant's own radiometers as needed. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Action: </B>Nigel and David to forward a list of relevant references

and the Chairman encouraged them to publish details of their new technique

in a scientific journal. <BR>

<BR>

Phil Slater(EOS Calibration Scientist) is also planning to form an EOS Calibration

Panel sub-group to co-ordinate and oversee all EOS-related vicarious calibration

activities. <BR>

<BR>

The Chairman thanked both David and Nigel for their presentations and was

sure that the new technique would soon be adopted by those using transfer

standards to assess the performance of space instruments. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Special Session on Future Validation Plans<BR>

<BR>

Phil Slater - MODIS calibration <BR>

</B><BR>

Phil gave details of the plans in place for EOS instrument cal/val. In particular

he discussed the calibration of the short-wave channels of the MODIS instrument.

Two techniques will be used - reflectance-based calibration and radiance-based

calibration. He described the errors involved in the calibration procedures

and detailed the traceability of the measurements using transfer standards.

A list of proposed intensive field campaigns was given along with plans

for pre-launch cal/val activities using ground-based test sites in the western

US. Hard copies of the presentation &quot;Validation of MODIS-derived top-of-atmosphere

spectral radiances by means of vicarious calibration&quot; were made available

at the meeting.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Mike Rast - MERIS Cal/Val Activities <BR>

</B><BR>

Mike reviewed the 15-band MERIS instrument characteristics, the System Performance

Parameters, and the operational characteristics. The MERIS Cal/Val Requirements

Report and plan is now complete. This includes calibration requirements,

validation of atmospheric correction requirements and the validation of

water constituents algorithms. Mike reviewed the following MERIS plans prior

to launch. <BR>

<BR>

1997 Identify and select vicarious calibration test sites, detailed plan

for VC, prepare airborne campaign, prepare data sets from MOS/OCTS/ in-situ,

and simulation studies for Case 1 and 2 waters. <BR>

<BR>

1998 analysis of variability of optical properties and aircraft campaign

for case 2 waters, cloud, vegetation, and VC sites.<BR>

<BR>

1999 evaluate campaign results and fine-tune calibration algorithms. <BR>

<BR>

Major questions for the IVOS groups to consider: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Where do we stand with respect to the design/definition of

a coordinated cal/val strategy for large scale optical sensors? <BR>

<BR>

2. What is the most commonly atmospheric transfer procedure used and what

could be the means of translating different correction procedures (between

different sensor data sets and consequently make products from different

sensors compatible? <BR>

<BR>

3. What Solar Irradiance profile shall we use? There are currently different

values being used in the community. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

Chris asked if the atmospheric correction issue can't be addressed by the

International Radiation Commission? Rao says not, due in part to the proliferation

of available RT programs. The key seems to be that investigators should

clearly document what RT code was used and, and importantly, what input

parameters (spectra etc) are used. <BR>

<BR>

Mike also presented information from the Atmospheric Chemistry Validation

Team (ACTV) (E. Attema). They have been working with GOME, MIPAS, GOMOS

and Sciamachy. They currently have actions to compile an inventory of validation

methods, select a data centre and informatics infrastructure, and to identify

likely participants. Plans include: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Feb 97 identification of ACTV members <BR>

<BR>

Summer 97 plenary ACTV meeting <BR>

<BR>

Summer 98 rehearsal campaign <BR>

<BR>

Autumn 99 Envisat commissioning</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

Chris Mutlow noted that MERIS/ATSR-2 and AATSR should be included as significant

parts of the cal/val plans.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Giancarlo Maracci - Vegetation Programme<BR>

</B><BR>

Giancarlo presented an overview of the VEGETATION instrument characteristics

including a brief description of the on-board calibration for the vegetation

monitor. Additional general information is available at http://www-vegetation.cst.cnes.fr:8050/.

A launch is scheduled for the second half of 1998. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Chris Mutlow - AATSR validation <BR>

</B><BR>

AATSR will be tied to the same calibration sources as the earlier instruments

(ATSR and ATSR-2). The AATSR would be going into the Thermal-Vacuum test

chamber soon. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Strategy for Cal/Val of Large Scale Optical Sensors</B> <BR>

<BR>

The chairman suggested that one option to follow would be the method of

IOCCG as the inclusion of this activity in IVOS may be too big a task to

handle efficiently. Alan Belward stated that this should stay in IVOS because

the people who are key to this coordination should be involved in IVOS.

Chris Mutlow indicated that the list of attendees may be slightly different,

but the work could take place in conjunction with IVOS. Several people agreed

that a good first step would be to work on an intercomparison and a coordinated

calibration effort over a selected site and the Egyptian (Libyan) desert

appeared to be a good candidate. Participants would be asked to bring data

samples and actually work through the intercomparison during the next IVOS

meeting; this may preempt work on an IVOS data set. <BR>

<BR>

It was also noted that two geostationary satellites cover the Libyan Desert

Test Site. Chris will identify people who need to be contacted in order

to select a time period, and set up the task. The assumption is that the

site will be the Libyan Desert (21-23N and 28-29E) and TOA radiances will

be investigated. Guiseppe Zibordi offered to gather a coincident MOS, OCTS,

and in-situ data for a coordinated validation effort. Mike Rast noted that

this exercise (pilot project) should be viewed as a first step in developing

a coordinated cal/val strategy. In addition, the information about RT procedures

should be spelled out clearly and used in the intercalibration exercise

in order to better identify the specific information which should be requested

in the future. Klaus-Dieter Rockwitz noted that an atmospheric instrument

group (in ESA) could be asked to develop a strategic plan for calibration

and validation and report provide this as input to IVOS.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Strategic Plan<BR>

</B><BR>

IVOS plans: these should be updated before the next meeting. Alan noted

that some other mechanism may be used for the ``living document'' which

describes the WGCV activities. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Recommendations to WGCV<BR>

</B><BR>

Recommendations will be held over until the next subgroup meeting as this

will take place before the next plenary. <BR>

<B>Next Meeting<BR>

</B><BR>

The Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics has offered to host the next

WGCV meeting in China. IVOS members unanimously expressed the wish to hold

the next IVOS meeting during the two days preceding this meeting. There

were two time constraints that should be considered in setting these dates.

<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The IGARSS meeting - Aug 4-8 in Singapore.<BR>

<BR>

2. NOAA-K will be launched in mid-August which may impact the NASA and NOAA

folks' ability to participate. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

The new IVOS Chair would circulate the dates and details of the next meeting

as soon as they were available. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Close<BR>

</B><BR>

The chairman thanked DLR and DARA for co-hosting the meeting and thought

that it had been a good meeting. He was hopeful that by the next meeting

there would be a substantial increase in the information on test sites that

was available on the WWW and that the Libyan Desert exercise would be a

start in developing closer collaboration between space agencies in cal/val

activities. The meeting closed at 5 pm. <BR>

<B>2. PRIMARY THREAD: EARTH OBSERVATION DATA CONSISTENCY &amp; STANDARDISATION<BR>
<BR>
</B>The development and demonstration of 'best practice' base data streams
and value added products from Earth Observation data forms a primary issue
for both research scientists and end users. As defined in the Simpson Report
(Simpson <I>et al</I>., 1995), the data streams available today vary considerably
in level of processing and usefulness from raw information from sensors
(Level 0) through various degrees of reformatting and sensor correction
or formatting (Level 1 and 1.5) to scientifically and applicable data streams
(Levels 2 and 3).<BR>
<BR>
The effective use of Earth Observation data for research or commerce to
map and monitor the Earth retrospectively or prospectively requires a base
level of consistency &amp; standardisation of both the geophysical data
(Level 2) and Value Added Product (Level 3) type. By 'geophysical' data
(Level 2) are generally meant time series of geolocated (and possibly mosaicked)
images of derived physical parameters such as surface temperature, wavelength
dependent emissivity, wavelength dependent reflectance and possibly some
integrated and derived products such as albedo or BRDF.<BR>
<BR>
A useful distinction can also be made between 'primary' geophysical data
(Level 2) and 'secondary' geophysical data (Level 2.5) according to whether
the parameter is derived only from the remotely sensed data or uses ancillary
(eg meteorological or GIS) data.<BR>
<BR>
By Value Added (or Level 3) Products are generally meant products that address
the applications products that are driving the user end of the process.
Products such landcover attributes, soil moisture or evaporation, ocean
productivity and phytoplankton distribution and dynamics, cropping stress,
fertiliser levels and potential yield are such examples. Sometimes the products
are quantitative physical measures but as often they are indices or nominal
categories. The time series of consistent and standardised geophysical (Level
2) data plus appropriate ancillary data are the material on which they depend.<BR>
<BR>
The methods that produce consistent and validated series of either base
Level 2 or value added Level 3 products will be the nominated 'best practice'
methods. They are a base for researchers and users alike to start from even
though researchers and users often emphasise different aspects of the series.
Realising consistent, standardised and accurate data streams involves a
combination of operational calibration and validation activities as well
as the establishment of effective base algorithms and processing pathways.<BR>
<BR>
All methods and products involved in producing these series require definable
and reachable standards as well as estimates of reliability if they are
to serve the more sophisticated needs of the researchers and users in the
growing Earth Observation area. But users often emphasise consistency where
researchers emphasise accuracy (Jupp, 1996a). In the Thread being defined
here, we will demand that the consistency be applicable to the base of existing
data and the accuracy be sufficient for the information to be combined with
models.<BR>
<BR>
The Thread consists of: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. A base of well managed field and laboratory instrumentation<BR>
2. Instrumented and established calibration sites and field campaigns<BR>
3. Well established sensor, atmosphere &amp; scene models<BR>
4. Well defined validation processes for the methods<BR>
5. A data base of satellite and ancillary data<BR>
6. Data management for the data volumes entailed <BR>
7. Effective algorithms and processing tools<BR>
8. A delivery mechanism for standardised, quality output products</BLOCKQUOTE>
The need for such an end-to-end system has been often stated by end users.
For example, see McVicar (1996). The reason can be illustrated by considering
the following apparently simple 'requirements': 
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The same top of the atmosphere radiance should give the same
'value' - that is the data should be consistently calibrated and Level 1.5
calibrated data should therefore be consistent.<BR>
2. If the actual geophysical parameters associated with a scene target do
not change the Level 2 data do not change - that is the processing should
be consistent</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is a measure of the need for focused EOC activity that these very basic
requirements generally cannot be met using the available data streams. To
meet the first requirement involves maintaining calibration of the particular
space borne instrument by 'vicarious' means for most satellite systems.
The second involves the specification and validation of intermediate processing
methods. The process may involve empirical reference sites as briefly described
below or it may involve more complex atmospheric correction but whatever
method is used, in order to be useful it needs to be consistent and to meet
a standard against which the products can be assessed.<BR>
<BR>
The objective of the set of EOC Tasks outlined here is to demonstrate the
means to establish these and other requirements in a way that ensures quality
Level 2 products in a selected set of cases and implies a generic approach
to ensuring quality is available in future data streams.<BR>
<BR>
Initial EOC Threads in Jupp (1996c) which are being addressed through this
initial integrated Thread are: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>EnvSat Standardisation Thread (except for Software Tools)<BR>
Cal&amp; Val Thread<BR>
Surface/Atmosphere Measurement Models Thread<BR>
GMS Pathfinder Thread<BR>
Data Management [&amp; Integration] Thread</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the following, the component Task are outlined. To start this integrated
set of Tasks, the 'blue touchpaper' is to decide the candidate geophyisical
parameters and value added products and to decide the actual data sets that
are the grist to the process. This topic will be high on the agenda at the
second Task Definition Meeting in Hobart on August 29/30.<BR>

more convenient and effective for many tasks than more &quot;powerful&quot;
languages. This book is meant to help readers learn how to program in C.
It is not an introductory programming manual - it assumes some familiarity

standards for vegetation survey, in the light of recent technological innovations,
notably Spatial Information Systems and Global Positioning Systems&quot;
[from Executive Summary]. A result of the Workshop was a detailed revision
of the Core Attributes for Terrestrial Biological Survey Data in Australia.

<H2>CEOS assesses Global Observing Strategy</H2>
<H3><HR></H3>
<BR>
About 50 leading scientists and space agency officials met in Seattle, Washington
State USA, 27&shyp;29 March 1996, to consider the advancement of an international
strategy for long-term global observation measurements required for climate
change studies, disaster monitoring, and other research or operational needs.
<BR>
<BR>
The Seattle meeting, formally titled the 'Ad Hoc Meeting on Space Component
for an Integrated Global Observing Strategy', was convened by the Committee
on Earth Observation Satellites, CEOS (see Box), and hosted by the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA). Dr Brian Embleton, Head of CSIRO Office
of Space Science &amp; Applications/Earth Observation Centre, was the chair
throughout the 3-day meeting. <BR>
<P><CENTER><A HREF="691.htm"><IMG SRC="691s.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="79"
ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER>
<P>The main aim of the gathering was to consider how the international community
might best meet future needs for global measurements of natural phenomena.
In particular, the meeting considered how space-based observations might
be better planned and co-ordinated, in order to meet the research and operational
needs of international programs such as the Global Ocean Observing System
(GOOS), the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and the International
Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP). <BR>
<BR>
Amongst other items, the meeting paid special attention to how user requirements
might be specified and incorporated into the Earth observation activities
of CEOS members; the potential role of CEOS in a future Integrated Global
Observing Strategy; and the interdependencies of satellite operators; service
users; and space-based and local measurement.<BR>
<BR>
Later in the year, in September at Geneva, a related ad hoc meeting will
consider the co-ordination of local or 'in situ' measurements, for similar
purposes. This meeting will be convened by GCOS. For continuity and integration,
the organising committee will share several members with the group which
organised the Seattle meeting. <BR>

<BR>
The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites was formed in 1984, and is
dedicated to optimising the benefits of Earth observation, acting as a focal
point for mission co-ordination; and exchanging policy and technical information
about Earth observation programs, missions, and data systems. Further information
about CEOS can be found on the CEOS Information System, at <BR>

<H4><A NAME="anchor5157392"></A>NASDA and CSIRO renew agreement</H4>
<BR>
During the Seattle meeting, CSIRO and the National Space Development Agency
of Japan (NASDA) finalised an amendment to their agreement on the direct
reception and distribution of MOS-1 data. The initial agreement, signed
in 1987 and subsequently amended twice, allows for commercial distribution
of the Marine Observation Satellite (MOS) data, received on behalf of CSIRO
in Australia by the Australian Centre for Remote Sensing.<BR>
<BR>
The new amendment, effective from 1 April 1996, moves the emphasis of the
co-operative project towards non-commercial research use. <BR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>SPOT turns 10</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../gifs/paper1.gif">FEATURE ARTICLE by Wayne Deeker<HR> <H2>SPOT turns 10</H2><H3><HR></H3><BR>This month, SPOT (Syst&egrave;me Pour l'Observation de la Terre) celebratesten years of successful operation. Europe's SPOT was the first remote sensingsatellite system designed to operate commercially, and has grown to becomea versatile and successful global commercial service.<BR><BR>France's space agency, CNES, designed SPOT's satellite and ground stationsystem. In 1984, France unsuccessfully sought partnership arrangements withthe European Space Agency and US Government. The international scientificcommunity has also from time to time expressed doubts about SPOT's commercialfocus, although today the scientific community is a frequent user of SPOTdata. <BR><BR>France in 1984 took a long term view of the development of commercial Earthobservation systems, constructing the system with support from Belgium andSweden.<BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="696.htm"><IMG SRC="696s.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="96"ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER><P>SPOT uniquely offered high resolution, frequently resampled colour images,available in stereo (see<A HREF="box3.htm"> &quot;SPOT Images&quot;</A>).The images compared in quality and resolution to aerial photography, thoughcosting much less, with a global coverage. <BR><BR>SPOT weathered the initial critical response, gradually entering traditionalremote sensing markets (cartography, coastal monitoring, agricultural forecasting)and establishing new ones. After a few years, SPOT was in profit, and untilthe launch of IRS-1C in 1995, was regarded as the best civilian technologyavailable in terms of spatial resolution. In 1994, SPOT earned approximatelyA$60 million.<BR><BR>Now, SPOT is used more for public-interest resource management, and lessfor private commercial gain, than predicted. The world's many governmentresource-management agencies, SPOT's largest market, use the images in diverseways (see<A HREF="box1.htm"> &quot;Some SPOT Applications&quot;</A>). <BR><BR>SPOT data also contribute to international research programs, includingglobal change monitoring. For example, COSSA/EOC purchased a number of SPOTscenes under a special arrangement with SPOT Imaging Services, in conjunctionwith a High Resolution Data Set Pilot Project within the Committee on EarthObservation Satellites. <BR><BR>These scenes provided cover of the Northern Australian Tropical Transect(NATT); scientists around the world use these data to study climate variabilityand its interaction with agriculture and pastoralism.<BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="698.htm"><IMG SRC="698s.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150"ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="699.htm"><IMG SRC="699s.gif"WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER><P>SPOT's onboard recording system can be programmed to acquire data fromvirtually of anywhere on Earth (See <A HREF="box2.htm">&quot;SPOT Satellites&quot;</A>).Program requests can be arranged through SPOT Image or any of its agents,and are then ordered from SPOT Imaging Services. The Data Acquisition Facilityof the Australian Centre for Remote Sensing (ACRES) receives and distributesAustralasian SPOT data.<BR><BR>SPOT has utilised three identical satellites since 1986. <BR><BR>SPOT-1 is dormant in a holding pattern. SPOT-2, launched in 1990, and SPOT-3,launched in 1993, operate simultaneously, partly to meet demand for SPOTimagery of the Northern Hemisphere growing season. Customers may quicklyobtain any of the 4 million archived images.<BR>SPOT-4 is under construction, scheduled for launch in early 1998. Whileearlier satellites were identical for image continuity, SPOT-4 offers severalimprovements. Its lifetime will be 5 years, not 3, and it will carry twicethe previous payload. Both HRV instruments (<A HREF="box2.htm">&quot;SPOTSatellites&quot;)</A> will be programmable for independent acquisition,greatly increasing imaging opportunities.<BR><BR>Other improvements include a precision positioning system, 10 m colour pixels,simultaneous high/low resolution, and a new detector receiving infraredin the 1.5&shyp;1.7 micron band. Atmospheric water does not reflect thesewavelengths, but plant-tissue water does. The detector will enable measurementof plant water stress, providing harvest estimates and many other uses.<BR><BR>Beyond that, SPOT-5A and 5B, due for launch after 2000, will further thesensor and tracking improvements. SPOT should be around well into the 21stCentury; users will continue to benefit from detailed high quality images,made to order.

The report details CEOS (Committee onEarth Observation Satellites) member bodies' successful use of satellitedata, and the resulting civil, scientific and other benefits. Members includeall civil agencies managing Earth Observation (EO) satellites and thosereceiving or processing the data. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="6910.gif" WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="200" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>The report outlines EO projects with applications to: <UL><LI>agriculture; <LI>resource management and surveying; <LI>hazard monitoring and disaster assessment; <LI>civil mapping and planning; <LI>ice monitoring; <LI>coastal zone management; and <LI>oceanography. </UL>Climate change and meteorological applications are excluded, as these usesare documented elsewhere. <BR><BR>All CEOS bodies and related organisations supplied project details, butthe report includes only mature, operational applications showing practicalresults.<BR><BR>The thirty-six described projects employ a variety of passive and activesensors, covering a large spectral range. Most are imaging sensors, eitheroptical or radar.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>OBITUARY Stanley Keith Runcorn</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../gifs/paper1.gif">OBITUARY<BR><HR><H2><A NAME="anchor1209861"></A>Stanley Keith Runcorn</H2><H3><HR></H3>Professor Keith Runcorn, a founder of modern Geophysics, was murdered inDecember 1995 in San Diego, while on a US lecture tour. Professor Runcorn,aged 73, disturbed a thief in his motel room.<BR><BR>Professor Runcorn pioneered studying the Earth through physics and mathematics.In particular, he used palaeomagnetic records to clarify the Earth's history.<BR><BR>Runcorn was born in Southport, Lancashire, in 1922, then educated at a localgrammar school and Cambridge. During World War II he studied mechanicalsciences, and in 1943 started work at the Radar Research and DevelopmentEstablishment. <BR><BR>In 1946 Runcorn joined Manchester University staff and collaborated withProfessor Patrick Blackett, then working on the origin of the Earth's magneticfield. Over successive appointments, at Cambridge in 1950 then the Universityof Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in 1955, Runcorn developed Blackett's magnetometer,applying it to studying fossil magnetism. Runcorn and colleagues later turnedtheir new geophysical techniques to the question of continental drift. <BR><BR>Several eminent scientists 'proved' this then-unpopular theory 'impossible'.Runcorn himself did not initially support the idea. But after further investigation,Runcorn countered, using American and European rocks of varying geologicalages to establish that continents had moved relative to each other and theEarth's axis.<BR><BR>During the 1960s and early 1970s, Runcorn conducted conferences under theauspices of the NATO Advanced Study Institute. This annual series of geophysicalmeetings furthered the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne's scientific standing.Also in the 1960s, NASA appointed Runcorn principal investigator to itsApollo lunar program, where he greatly developed understanding of the moon'smagnetic field.<BR><BR>His honours include the highest prizes offered to Earth scientists: theVetlesen Prize (1971); the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society(1984); and the John Adams Fleming Medal of the American Geophysical Union.He was also a member of the prestigious Pontifical Academy of Sciences.<BR><BR>Runcorn lectured widely on his other areas of interest: architecture, plusart-, national- and religious-history.<BR><BR>A sincere and caring man, Professor Runcorn is survived by his sister andmother, and many friends and colleagues with whom he kept in touch despitehis frenetic lecture and travel schedule. <BR>A colleague recently wrote that his reputation as one of the foremost geophysicistsof his generation will persist long after his death, as will memories ofhis warmth and sincerity. <BR><BR>B.J.J.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Earth Observation Centre progress</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../gifs/paper1.gif"><HR><H2><A NAME="anchor1209861"></A>Earth Observation Centre progress</H2><H3><HR></H3>Dr David Jupp<BR>Science Program Leader<BR>CSIRO Earth Observation Centre<BR><BR>The following is an excerpt from the Foreword of the CSIRO Earth ObservationCentre's <A HREF="../eoc/eocpln1.htm">Science Plan</A>.<BR><BR><HR>In the period between now and the year 2000, Australia is set to bepart of a rapid development of Earth Observation technology and opportunities.The application of Earth observing technologies throughout our region andthe world will be a major activity as resource and environmental assessmentand monitoring is done at many scales and over vast areas of the land andocean. <BR><BR>Australia will certainly be a developer of advanced methods and technologiesfor Earth Observation, surveillance and monitoring from satellite and aircraftplatforms and may have a developing satellite launch, sensors, and servicesindustry. In addition, in an era of data encryption and 'closeable' skies,Australia will need to gather, process and interpret a significant amountof its own resource and environmental data and information. <H3>Taking charge of innovation</H3>In order to show leadership in this area, Australian scientists and industrymust decide that we are to be more than a launch site provider, data consumerand user of other nations' technology. We must 'take charge' of the innovationthat is needed to own the advances that will emerge. Industry and scientistsmust work together to make the results of research create competitive advantagesthrough products having the highest quality and meeting the strictest internationalstandards. Showing national leadership in this task is a role CSIRO canand should take.<BR><BR>The need for a CSIRO Earth Observation Centre (EOC) has developed as thevalue of focusing the skills of CSIRO scientists in Earth Observation Sciencehas become clear and the disadvantages of dispersed activities have becomepatent. Modern Earth observing research has advanced from description, datagathering and exploratory image processing to a point where the value ofremote sensing data as measurements is paramount. Remotely sensed measurementscan be collected in a range of data dimensions and at time and space scaleswhich cannot be accessed in any other way. <BR><BR>This has enabled geographical applications of Earth Observation to proceedin terms of scientific models and process understanding. The physical linkbetween the data and the parameters of interest to users is providing thereturns that previous image processing and 'correlation' based approachescould only suggest as being possible. In the generic development of thisopportunity, the CSIRO EOC can create a base of knowledge that will underpinremote sensing applications in CSIRO Divisions, and build competitive advantagefor value-adding industry. <H3>Focus on generic Earth Observation science</H3>In 1994&shyp;95, an extended review of CSIRO's efforts in Earth observationdata use was carried out under the chairmanship of Dr James Simpson of theUniversity of California in San Diego (COSSA Publication 034). This reviewrecommended greater collaboration and rationalisation plus much greateremphasis on algorithm development and value adding. In the pursuit of theReport's primary recommendation, to form an EOC, it was realised that theneed for focus and collaboration extended well beyond data acquisition-whichis, in the end, primarily an Agency responsibility. The development of anEOC founded on generic, multi-disciplinary and cross-Divisional issues includingscene and atmospheric measurement models and algorithms was perceived asa basis for developing collaboration and rationalisation throughout theEarth Observation activities of CSIRO. EOC projects will be outcome orientatedand collaborative, with the outcomes owned by all of the participating groups.The move to form an EOC has recognised that there are issues of Earth Observationscience that are common to many groups and that focusing teams on resolvingthese issues was vital to the needs of all, but beyond the capacity of anyone current group.<BR><BR>In particular, the need for special focus on generic Earth Observation scienceis paramount to the successful development of clients and markets addressedby CSIRO Divisions and the Australian product delivery industry. These developmentsand client acceptance of the products are currently highly sensitive tothe quality of the data products and value adding and hence to focused inputfrom the base of excellent scientists that CSIRO has in Earth Observation.The 'delivery ratio' of generic research to market satisfaction can be veryhigh. CSIRO has an opportunity for niche development in generic Earth Observationscience and the provision of Best Practice methods which have immediatepayoffs in environmental and resource applications and to the developingspace and aircraft based mapping and monitoring industries. <H3>Science Plan</H3>A Science Plan has been developed and has been discussed widely in CSIRO.The Plan has taken the input material and the responses of scientists andgroups interested in the EOC. <BR><BR>The Plan seeks to help Australia's efforts in the field of Earth Observationfrom space and aircraft platforms. One of the Centre's objectives is forthe associated services industries to be recognised and successful throughoutour region and a leader in worldwide applications. It provides a means forCSIRO excellence becoming standard practice in the industries addressedby CSIRO Divisions and in the information delivery industry that Australiawill continue to develop in the coming years. <BR><BR><HR><A HREF="spin691.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="spin6912.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="spin6914.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

MSIP is a terrain visualisationtool, using ERDAS Imagine for image analysis and map updating.<BR><BR>Changing the borders took minutes, requiring only drawing lines on a screen,then printing the new maps. Maps were printed using the DMA's Remote ReplicationSystem (RRS), a mapping package also based on Imagine. <BR><BR>During the three-week negotiations, the Imagine systems created, revisedand printed over 3000 maps. The final Bosnian peace agreement included over100 computer-produced maps, initialled and officially sealed by the Presidentsof the three countries.<BR><BR>Imagine technology, having aided in negotiating the agreement, is also helpingin its maintenance. US pilots and troops rehearse and plan for missionslong before they arrive in the region.<BR>Early in the NATO operation, few maps were available for even the simplestnavigations.

<H3>Welcome to </H3>

<H3>Looking Around</H3>

<P>
<I>A contemporary assessment of landcover disturbance for the
Australian Continent</I> 
<P>
by Dean Graetz, Murray Wilson and Susan Campbell,
<P>
CSIRO Earth Observation Centre,
<P>
Australia.<HR>

<P>
This electronic document reports a scientific assessment of the
current state of the landcover of the Australian continent undertaken
by CSIRO. Through this study, we wanted to establish a continental
picture of the extent and severity of landcover disturbance, the
changes in the vegetation and soils, as of the beginning of this
decade.
<P>
We undertook this study to provide a contemporary understanding
and to relate the findings to the continuing problem of the loss
of biodiversity. We publish the findings in this format to make
them accessible to all who are interested.
<P>
How you proceed through this publication is entirely up to you.
<P>
We want to communicate to you four messages:
<UL>
<LI>Why we studied landcover disturbance for the continent
<LI>How we did it;
<LI>What we found;
<LI>What it all means.
</UL>

<P>
We tell this story in two different formats, and in one of these
formats, this compact disk, we tell the story in two different
ways.
<P>
Our story is told in printed format as a report entitled
<P>
<B>'Landcover disturbance over the Australian continent: A contemporary
assessment'.</B> 
<P>
by R.D. Graetz, M.A. Wilson and S.K. Campbell, 1995.
<P>
Biodiversity Series, Paper No. 7.
<P>
A copy of the printed report can be obtained from the <A HREF="dest.htm">Biodiversity Unit of DEST</A>.
<P>
<B>When you see highlighted text (as in the last sentence), you
may click on it to link to further or related information on the
CDROM.</B><HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1863_007.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1863_007.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<B>NB: Throughout this report you may click on small pictures
like this to see a larger version. </B><HR>

<P>
The second format of our story is the one you are using now.
<P>
<B>With an electronic document such as this you may navigate at
will through the sections using the &quot;go forward&quot; or
&quot;go back&quot; facilities of your browsing software, and
by clicking on highlighted words or phrases. Additionally you
may use other features of your browsing software to, for example,
print a section of interest.</B> 
<P>
<B>At the bottom of each electronic page you will see three buttons.
One button returns you to the &quot;Contents&quot; page, the other
two enable you to step forwards or backwards through the whole
document just as you would with a paper book.</B> 
<P>
Apart from the electronic document, the CDROM version contains
copies of the actual data used to arrive at our conclusions. This
summary of the project is a critical component of the scientific
culture. Science is a process of testable inquiry and it is important
that the findings of a research project are available for scrutiny
by others.
<P>
However, this data-only version of the story is unlikely to interest
the majority of readers. For more information about the datasets
provided on the CDROM refer to the <A HREF="../readme.txt">general readme file</A>
and the <A HREF="../datasets/readme.txt">readme file in the datasets directory</A>.
<P>
The complete, and therefore longest way, is the narrative path
by which the project will unfold in a logical sequence. At the
end, you will have the best overview of what we did, why we did
it, what we found, and what it all means.
<P>
However, with this format of electronic document, the reader is
free to move to whatever section desired.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1865_011.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1865_011.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
Before you continue with Looking Around, we raise a number of
points.
<P>
Whatever path you take through this electronic publication, you
are reading a document prepared by scientists. This is a scientific
document prepared and reviewed in the traditions of applied scientific
research - to provide the best answers possible to the significant
questions of our time.
<P>
The second point is that it is not common for scientific research
to be reported in a widely accessible format like compact disk.
It is not common, but it is not impossible to do so. Dramatic
changes in technology over the last three years now facilitate
communication between all sectors of society that was previously
not possible. We believe that all the components of this story,
objectives, methods and results, may be of interest to a wide
audience. Therefore, we have embraced the technologies necessary
to tell the story of this project in this enduring format.
<P>
Lastly, the style in which we write is personal and direct and
in contrast to the majority of science writing. This contrast
is not because scientists are all dull and boring, without passion
and character. Far from it. Scientists nearly always write for
other scientists: both parties know and understand the personal
commitment to scientific research and the agonies and ecstasies
in conducting it so they concentrate on only the objective details.
<P>
In this publication, we are communicating with non-scientists
(we think) so we have included details of the strengths and weaknesses
of the methods that were used and the difficulties that were encountered.
<P>
Moreover, we write in a personal and direct style because we want
you to be aware of how important we think this issue is, and how
good or bad a job we have made of the study.
<P>
Does a passion for your subject diminish the objectivity with
which you can conduct research? It can; but we believe it hasn't.
If you are interested in thinking about this further, then read
the small section called <A HREF="end.htm">A Personal Note </A>.
<P>
Finally, this document contains many images. They are not included
just for cosmetic reasons. Each image reinforces points that were
made in the text. Consider each image carefully and make a systematic
effort to interpret what you see. If you do this, we are certain
it will increase your enjoyment of this electronic document.

<H3>Introduction </H3>
<HR>

<P>
This chapter is the first of two that justify the project. It
begins to answer the question of why we did what we did by stating
the nature of the problem that we addressed.
<P>
It is a reflection upon both the maturity of Australian society
and on the nature of the principal issues that there is substantial
and persistent public interest in the state of the environment:
the well being of the entire Australian continent.
<P>
Three issues dominate contemporary public debate about the state
of the nation's environment. They are: sustainable landuse, the
loss of biodiversity, and the potential for climate change driven
by the Enhanced Greenhouse Effect (EGE).
<P>
All three issues are perceived by the public and by policy-makers
to be intimately related to the quality of life enjoyed by Australian
society; see, for example <A HREF="refs.htm">Bridgewater (1994)</A>,
<A HREF="refs.htm">Broome (1992)</A>, <A HREF="refs.htm">Cocks (1992)</A>,
<A HREF="refs.htm">Roberts (1995)</A>.
<P>
All three issues contain considerable uncertainty:
<UL>
<LI>What is the nature of the problem?;
<LI>How serious is it?;
<LI>What can be done about it?
</UL>

<P>
Our basic proposition is that there is a thread that links all
three issues. That thread is landcover; the cover of vegetation
and soils.
<P>
Changes in landcover, in vegetation and in soils, usually have
significant consequences for biodiversity, sustainable landuse,
and for changing the greenhouse gas composition of the global
atmosphere.
<P>
Therefore, a focus on landcover can contribute understanding to
all three issues.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1864_022.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1864_022.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<P>
<I>Landcover is another name for the land surface that is the
boundary between the atmosphere and the lithosphere. For the Australian
continent, it is predominantly vegetation and soils with a minor
percentage of dry salt lakes. The landcover of very large areas
of other continents consists only of snow and ice.</I><HR>

<P>
In this document we report the strategy and findings of an assessment
that we made of landcover disturbance for the entire Australian
continent.
<P>
The assessment had two objectives:
<UL>
<LI>to use contemporary (1990-1992) satellite image data to map
the type, severity and extent of landcover disturbance;
<LI>to integrate these data with existing understanding to explore
the implications of the landcover disturbance for biotic impoverishment,
the loss of biodiversity.
</UL>

<P>
We believe the findings presented here will interest a wide audience
because of their continental scope and currency: this is what
the nation's landscapes are like, now.
<P>
What was achieved here was built on earlier efforts. In the same
way, while we hope our undertaking will contribute to increased
overall understanding, it is far from the last word and will also
serve as a stepping stone for future efforts.
<P>
For example, within two years, we will publish our next step:
a more finely detailed assessment of the landcover clearing rate
over the last decade. Until these and other studies are completed,
we offer this document as a contemporary mapping of the disturbance
level of continental landcover, and an assessment of its consequences
for biotic impoverishment, both existing and potential.<HR>

<HR>

<H4>Something To Think About </H4>

<P>
We have set ourselves the goal of undertaking a survey of the
entire continent to examine the big picture. For the reader to
begin to appreciate the spatial scales of this report we recommend
that you examine this image of Australia and navigate your way
around it using the geographic knowledge that you have.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="reptill/ausmssal.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/ausmssal.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>This is a contemporary image of the nature and condition of
the landcover of the entire continent. The ecological information
that can be extracted from this image is both empowering and unique.
For a continental assessment - the big picture - space data is
a critical prerequisite.</I><HR>

<H3>Establishing The Links </H3>
<HR>

<P>
The acceptance of the findings reported here will largely be determined
by the credibility of the argument that links biodiversity with
contemporary satellite measurements of landcover. The following
sections establish those links. We begin the argument with this
image. <HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0648_006.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0648_006.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>We present an uncommon view of biodiversity. It is a landscape
scaled view, an overview like this image, that seeks understanding
of general trends rather than detail. Concern for biodiversity
is sometimes disparagingly called biological stamp collecting.
Using this metaphor, our concern is to understand the workings
of the postal system.</I><HR>

was developed. The integrity of each part and its synergy with
the other two is critical to the credibility of the assessment.

<H3>The Big Picture: A National Summary Of Disturbance </H3>
<HR>

<P>
The continental overview that we have assembled was made up of
two separate pictures.
<P>
For the ILZ, which is 39% of the continent, computer processing
of satellite data compiled a high resolution image of clearing.
<P>
For the ELZ, based on expert interpretation of satellite images,
the remaining 61% of the continent was allocated into three levels
of landcover disturbance resulting from grazing and, to a much
lesser extent, burning.
<P>
In this chapter, these two primary datasets are brought together
to provide a national overview, the big picture. These data are
presented according to a sequence of questions that might flow
from the generic one - what did we find?

<H3>The Detailed Picture: Individual Landcover Types </H3>
<HR>

<P>
The previous chapter reported the big picture; an overview of
the continent and States and Territories.
<P>
This section is a preparation for the next on <A HREF="content5.htm">Case Studies</A>.
Both of these sections report in detail on individual landcover
types.
<P>
Before doing so, we remind the reader that the primary focus of
this project was the entire continent: we systematically sought
to derive a consistent overall view. This objective required that
we worked at coarse spatial scales and what is particularly relevant
here, paid equal attention to all landcover types.
<P>
As a consequence, the results may be puzzling. Some of the landcover
types that are the subject of frequent public debate do not occupy
a central place, or even seem important.
<P>
One such example is the closed forests of the tropical coasts
(xTML4 - the closed forests), which cover only a few percent of
the area of the continent; see Table 3 and the following image
of Townsville. <HR>

<P>
<A HREF="reptill/townsvil.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/townsvil.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The 1: 1, 000, 000 scale map sheet TOWNSVILLE covering the
tropical Queensland coast and inland; total area approximately
120, 000 km2. A very large proportion of the tropical rainforests
was located in this region. A moment's interpretation of the colours
and patterns in this image results in the conclusion that the
landscapes are now significantly modified. Landuse has, and continues,
to influence this landcover type.</I><HR>

<P>
We also remind the reader that we have no index of biodiversity
importance with which to sensitise or further stratify our analysis.
<P>
No doubt, because of their intrinsically high biodiversity complement,
the tropical rainforests have high conservation value. Unfortunately,
the equivalent data and understanding are lacking whereby the
remaining landcover types can be ranked for biodiversity significance
or even conservation status.
<P>
At present, importance for biodiversity is most commonly assigned
simply on the basis of the presence of small populations of a
rare species, usually fauna. We would prefer to assign importance
and stratify our study on the basis of continental datasets of
the level of endemism, and on the nature and level of threat.
We believe this report contributes to the latter approach.
<P>
Unfortunately, there is no continental assessment of endemism.
<P>
The remainder of this chapter details how and what will be reported
in <A HREF="content5.htm">Case Studies</A>.
<P>
If you are interested in the Case Studies, then it is worth your
while to continue with this section.<HR>

<H4>Reporting Methodology </H4>
<HR>

<P>
The current level of landcover disturbance and vulnerability to
further disturbance were separately assessed for each of the 33
landcover types within both the ILZ and ELZ.
<P>
From this complete list, a subset of 16 types is presented in
detail with this common format of reporting and scoring.
<P>
<B>Description</B> 
<P>
Each landcover type is identified with its number and symbol,
described in terms of the structural and floristic grouping, and
illustrated with a landscape photograph.
<P>
To convey an overall impression of where a particular landcover
type is found in a regional landscape, a pair of satellite images
is provided. The first image of the pair shows the entire regional
landscape: the second shows just the landcover type.
<P>
<B>Size And Location</B> 
<P>
A tabular summary of the absolute and relative aggregate area
within the ILZ and ELZ is provided along with an image of the
relative size and distribution of all locations of this landcover
type for the following:

<H3>Looking Forward </H3>
<HR>

<P>
This project was the result of two separate activities: the interpretation
of landcover disturbance from satellite data and the integration
of these interpretations with ancillary data.
<P>
A satellite data-set was used because it was contemporary, objectively
acquired, and digitally malleable.
<P>
The ancillary data-sets were used to interpret (landcover, tenure),
enhance (feral animals and fire), and report (ILZ, ELZ, States
and Territories) the interpreted satellite data.
<P>
The objective was to present an assessment of the landcover disturbance
for the continent, and to interpret this assessment in terms of
present and potential loss of biodiversity.
<P>
The acceptance of the findings presented here is largely determined
by the credibility of the interpretation of landcover disturbance
from satellite data because it underpins all else. The interpretation
that was finally used was one of many that were exhaustively tested
during the lifetime of this project.
<P>
Errors of commission and omission were unavoidable. We strove
to minimise both. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains: most critically
with the assessment of clearing. Where possible, we tested our
findings against other estimates to indicate the direction and
magnitude of error.
<P>
The results are presented in a pragmatic spirit of applied science
- to present the best continental picture possible at this time.
This is the same spirit and intent that motivated the publication
of the Atlas of Australian Resources series; in particular, the
most recent Vegetation volume; <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>.
Australia is, as the result of considerable effort, a well-mapped
continent. This raft of resource knowledge supports not only government
policies but also public debate about those policies. We hope
that this work will also contribute to a better understanding
of the Australian continent.
<P>
Five significant points emerged at the end of this study. The
first was that the level of thinning and clearing was high. Even
allowing for an omission error as high as 20%, the area was much
larger than has been generally appreciated. Most of this unrecognised
clearing was in the traditional pastoral areas of Queensland and
Northern NSW where areas of sown pastures have expanded at the
expense of open eucalypt and acacia woodlands. Also, to a much
smaller extent, we suspect that there has been a loss of large
remnants within the core areas of the croplands. This speculation
will only be tested by a continental study of the rate of change
over the last few decades.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0145_002.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0145_002.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The aggregate tables of clearing and the graphics illustrating
fragmentation of clearing do not convey the same impact as the
view from space. The established cereal cropping areas of southern
Australia present a particularly bleak panorama: especially those
of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. They are extensively
cleared. As habitats, they are irreversibly altered. Those remnants
remaining are both small and isolated.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0648_032.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0648_032.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The second point was that the ELZ was, in contrast to the ILZ,
much less disturbed by grazing landuse on a continental scale.
This reduced level of disturbance owes more to the intrinsic resilience
of the more extensive landcover types, the grasslands and low
shrublands, than to the conservative management of pastoral landuse,
past and present.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1864_061.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1864_061.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
Considered together, the disturbance of clearing and grazing must
have been, and will continue to be, a significant driver of the
process of biotic erosion. The landcovers that have been most
disturbed are the best country; those that enjoy the highest rainfall
and therefore have the highest productivity. While we do not yet
have the quantitative functional relationships to support this
conclusion, we believe it must be so. Between them, the landuses
of agriculture and pastoralism have 'taken the eyes of the land'.
The case studies support this view.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="map/adelaid.gif"><IMG SRC="maps/adelaid.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The third point was the exacerbating impact of feral animals.
Where landuse disturbance was high, so also was the density of
feral animals.
<P>
The next point was not illustrated by data in this report but
it bears heavily on any conclusions that can be drawn from it.
Simply: Of the two drivers of future biotic erosion, the contribution
of landuse, from clearing and poor grazing management is manageable
while that from feral animals is not; or not yet, although concerted
efforts are underway to achieve this goal.
<P>
Finally, the basic premise of this project - that there is a relationship
between disturbance and biodiversity - remains qualitative and
the limiting factor in translating this or any other measure of
landcover disturbance into quantitative estimates of biotic erosion.
While we hold that habitat destruction by clearing or grazing,
and habitat invasion by feral species are the two most significant
drivers of biotic erosion, we cannot translate the assessments
we have compiled here into any action.
<P>
Why not?
<P>
Two key relationships are missing. These are for any landcover
type, the relationship between species abundance and disturbance,
and between the level of endemism and the level of disturbance
threat.
<P>
These two relationships are considered sequentially. The <B>first
relationship</B>, displays species abundance within a landcover
type as a function of its use of landcover geography; ie in space
and time (x, y, z, t). While this relationship is strictly a multidimensional
surface, and not necessarily continuous, three hypothetical responses
are presented. Whatever the shape of the curve, it represents
a means of evaluating the current level of Threat. That is, given
this general relationship and actual measures of the current state
of landscape disturbance dimensioned in (x, y, z, t), then the
species response to Threat, in terms of its abundance in time
and space, can then be estimated.<HR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="chart/chap6/fig61.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
<I>An idealised framework for relating species abundance in time
and space to the time and space dimensions of habitat disturbance.
Three plausible response relationships are presented: a species
declines in linear proportion to the degree of disturbance (1);
a species shows resilience, then catastrophe (2); a species is
highly sensitive to disturbance (3).</I><HR>

<P>
The <B>second relationship</B> is between threat to a landcover
type and the level of endemism within that species complement.
We presume that endemism is the ultimate measure of irreplaceability.
Landcover types will be distributed within this two dimensional
space as indicated by hypothetical examples. The purpose of mapping
this relationship is to determine priority for action. Even the
simplest partition of this space into two levels, low and high,
would be more informative than our current understanding.<HR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="chart/chap6/fig62.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
<I>Hypothetical relationships between the overall level of species
endemism for landcover types and the level of Threat to which
each landcover type is exposed. By partitioning this space into
high and low, priorities for management can be rationally determined.
For example, landcover types 2 and 7 score the highest priority
for conservation management.</I><HR>

<P>
In closing, we bring attention to the issue of the location and
rate of landcover change; the dynamics of disturbance that was
outside the scope of this project.
<P>
Obviously, clearing was an essential part of agricultural development.
However, land degradation is an unnecessary consequence of poor
pastoral management.
<P>
The expansion of these two agents of landcover disturbance has
been driven and controlled by social forces, both local and international.
<P>
These forces are dynamic. Highly favourable commodity export prices
for wool, grain and beef come and go: those for the first two
are unlikely to ever be quite so favourable as in the past.
<P>
In the last two decades, changes in the values society attaches
to all the resources that land has to offer have found political
expression with most State Governments altering legislation, or
its management expression, relating to clearing and to pastoral
management. The motivation has been a long-term concern about
sustainability, and the expensive experience that the past approaches
were not perfect.
<P>
Given these changes, what are the dynamics of landcover change?
<P>
It is surprising, given the pivotal role of this question, that
it cannot be accurately answered; see <A HREF="refs.htm">Biodiversity Unit (1995)</A>.
<P>
An aggregate, non-spatial summary from data held by the ABS has
been compiled but not yet published by Bullen (F. Bullen, personal
communication). This time series shows the great expansion of
clearing post-World War II. This clearing was both for cereal
crops (WA, SA, NSW and Qld) and for pastures (principally Qld).
<P>
Noting that these ABS figures report less than 50% of the area
that we have found to be thinned and cleared, they also suggest
that clearing is slowing. However, non-systematic sampling surveys
using satellite data show the loss of uncleared remnants within
the core agricultural land continues; <A HREF="refs.htm">Graetz et al (1992), Sivertsen (1994)</A>.
In terms of biotic erosion, the loss of these remnants is far
more critical than indicated by their small areas.<HR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="chart/chap6/fig63.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
<I>The historical time course of clearing for crops and pastures.
Since the beginning of this century, the area cleared for pastures
has exceeded that for crops culminating in a marked expansion
from 1950 onwards.</I><HR>

<P>
Land management decisions at the level of the individual and of
governments will continue to influence the rate and direction
of the process of biotic erosion. The objective of this project
was to provide a contemporary assessment of the landcover condition
of the continent. This assessment in a small way will support
that decision making.<HR>

<B>A Personal Note </B>
<P>
This project was the work of a team. Of that team, one of us,
Dean Graetz, did all the writing. Therefore, the style and motivation
that shaped this electronic document largely reflect the interests
and passions of one person, me, the writer of the words you read.
<P>
I conceived and ran with this project. I did so because I believed
the issue of landcover disturbance to be important; not just to
the continuing loss of biodiversity but also to climate change
and the issue closest to my heart, sustainable landuse.
<P>
How this nation addresses these three issues over the next few
years will be determined by society through the normal processes
of political representation and debate.
<P>
As a scientist employed to contribute through research to the
well-being of all Australians, I can contribute in a small way
to this process of change through the conduct of research such
as we report here. My role is to inform the debate by undertaking
this type of research and disseminating its findings as widely
as I can to all who are interested.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1863_002.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1863_002.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<P>
As an ecological patriot with wide experience of Australia both
from on the ground and the view from space, I can try to persuade
all who read what I write that the long term well-being of the
land is important to all Australians, no matter where they live
or what they do. My colleagues and I began this process with two
publications several years ago; see <A HREF="refs.htm">Graetz et al (1992) and Wilson et al (1993)</A>.
<P>
As an individual I can share with you the endless delight and
enjoyment that I derive from the Australian environment. I am
interested in and experience pleasure from any part of my country,
but most especially from the bush, the outback. The desire to
share these experiences and to conserve the source for all future
Australians is my personal motivation.
<P>
Poetry is the most succinct way to communicate emotions. Consider
this poem about a very common tree in eastern Australia, the poplar
or bimble box (Eucalyptus populnea)
<P>
BIMBLE BOX (an Australian eucalypt)
<PRE>
The girl with English eyes said, 'Cautious tree,
Leaves waxed and edge-on to the sun'
She saw the sky part-broken by the limbs
And felt the shade was dappled sunlight.

Look to the ground - see cracks that tear the roots.
Read of earthquakes and know the treachery
Of a seeming solid that will gape and swallow.
These cracks are a slow shrinkage. They do not close.
Thrust down an arm and feel the dryness. Drop
A pebble, hear it rattle fifteen feet.
What would your English tree transpire but life -
Its umbrella of flat leaves searing?
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="scans/scan1.gif"><IMG SRC="scanss/scan1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<PRE>
This tree will live. Most surface roots will die
Torn by the crazed earth or exposed.
Desperate then the tree will reject its leaves
And dry earth receive them unaware
Of this pretence at mulching much too late.
Deep down the roots will prod in clay for sap
To support the few stiff leaves the tree retained.
This tree will live and when it rains
There'll be no burst of growth above the ground.
The healed earth will be laced with unseen roots.
There'll be an immeasurable swelling of the trunk
And a handful of new leaves edgewise to the sun

<P>
I have long admired this poem (used with kind permission of Eric
Rolls). With a clarity I envy, it expresses observations of the
living characteristics of a common rural gum tree. The poet's
interpretation of the behaviour of this tree through the seasons,
obviously based on patient observation, is scientifically sound.
I know of no better description of the adaptation of a native
tree to the unpredictable Australian environment.
<P>
The irony is that no matter how well adapted to the infertile
soils and harsh climate bimble box may be, fine tuned by evolution
over tens of thousands of years, this tree together with many
other tree species has suffered its greatest decline in the past
century as the direct result of clearing by European man for farming.
And Eric Rolls is a farmer.
<P>
We cannot live without agriculture. We will not survive without
transforming our environment to suit the well-being of human species.
That is not the question. The question is about balance: how much
do we change and how much do we use in other ways; how much is
changed now for the short term benefit of individuals compared
with that which is left for the collective benefit of society
in the long term?
<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1863_005.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1863_005.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
The future of the biodiversity of Australia will be determined
by the Australians that inhabit this landcover type, the built
environment of our cities. Through strong feedbacks, the condition
of the continent far away from the cities will determine the well-being
of the urban Australia.
<P>
This situation offers both opportunities and threats.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="end0">The Summary:</A></H1>

<H2>What It All Means </H2>
<HR>

<P>
This document outlines the objectives, strategy, findings and
limitations of a continent-wide assessment of landcover disturbance
undertaken by CSIRO staff on behalf of the Biodiversity Unit of
DEST.
<P>
The assessment had two objectives: to use contemporary (1990-1992)
satellite image data to map the type, severity and extent of landcover
disturbance across the continent; and to integrate these data
with existing understanding to explore the implications of the
landcover disturbance for biotic impoverishment, the loss of biodiversity.
<P>
In the formulation of these two goals, it was argued that landcover
is a tangible surrogate for habitat for all terrestrial life,
and that disturbed landcover represents a change in habitat suitability
that was usually a deleterious change.
<P>
The principal findings were three. First, within the intensive
landuse zone of the continent, we found that as of 1990, a total
of 1, 550, 000 km2 of forests and woodlands have been cleared
or thinned over the preceding 200 years. This represents 52% of
this landuse zone and 20% of the entire continent.
<P>
These figures are unexpectedly high, but nevertheless plausible.
Assuming a worst-case error analysis, the minimum figure was at
least 1, 240, 000 km2. Either of these two values revise the current
estimates of clearing upwards. Within this landuse zone, individual
landcover types have levels of clearing that range between 30%
and 99%, with an overall mean value of 47%. Almost everywhere
within this landuse zone, the degree of fragmentation of the remaining
landcover was high.
<P>
Second, within the remaining 4, 708, 000 km2 of the continent,
the extensive landuse zone, 37% of the continental area was assessed
to be slightly disturbed, 9% was substantially disturbed, with
15% interpreted as significantly disturbed. This distribution
of disturbance more strongly reflects the resilience of different
landcover types than the standard of pastoral management.
<P>
Combining these figures indicates that more than one third (35%)
of the continent was significantly disturbed out of the total
81% that was subject to active landuse. The remainder was allocated
to unused (12%) or conservation reserves (7%). Thus almost half
of the landcover subject to landuse was significantly disturbed.
A global comparison indicates that Australasia and South America
have equal lowest proportions of significantly disturbed landcover
(38%), with Europe containing the highest (86%).
<P>
While the landscapes of Australia are not as disturbed as those
of Europe, the extent of clearing is pervasive. The view from
space of the agricultural areas of this continent reveals the
little native vegetation that is left with which to conserve the
remnant biodiversity for the future.
<P>
By comparison, in the extensive landuse zone, the Australian Outback,
the prospect is far less daunting. Though disturbed, the landcover
remains relatively intact, and the standard of land management
can always be improved.
<P>
Considered together, the disturbance of clearing and grazing has
been, and will continue to be, a significant driver of the process
of biotic erosion; perhaps the most significant driver. The landcovers
that have been most disturbed were the richest country; those
that enjoy the highest rainfall and therefore have the highest
productivity. Between them, the landuses of agriculture and pastoralism
have 'taken the eyes of the land'. While we do not yet have the
quantitative functional relationships to support this conclusion,
we speculate that it must be so. The case studies, which cover
the bulk of the continent, support this view.
<P>
Third, by examining the protection offered by the different tenure
types across the continent, we conclude that the vulnerability
to future disturbance is high for all landcover types. Looking
to the future from the landscapes of today, it is evident that
conservation management by means of tenure protection, ie the
dedication of land in reserves or parks to preserve biodiversity,
is a limited strategy. Effective, off-park conservation strategies
are required to integrate the conservation of biodiversity with
other present and future landuses.
<P>
While it will be difficult, the broad scale integration of conservation
and landuse in the future is possible. Landuse is a social activity
and is therefore manageable by social means. Unfortunately, one
significant threat to the success of future conservation efforts
remains. Analysis of the distribution of four feral species (rabbit,
cat, fox, pig) thought to be significant drivers of biotic erosion
suggests that their presence exacerbates the effects of landcover
disturbance. While cats were mostly evenly distributed across
the continent, the highest densities of rabbits, foxes and pigs
coincide with the most severe and extensive landcover disturbance,
clearing.
<P>
The acceptance of the findings presented here is largely determined
by the credibility of the interpretation of landcover disturbance
from satellite and its linkage with biodiversity. The interpretation
that was finally used was one of many that were exhaustively tested
during this project. We strove to minimise errors of both commission
and omission, and where possible, we tested our findings against
other estimates to indicate the direction and magnitude of error.
Nonetheless, uncertainty remains; most critically with the assessment
of clearing. .
<P>
The results are presented in a pragmatic spirit of applied scientific
research - to present the best understanding possible at this
time. This was the same spirit and intent that motivated the publication
of the Atlas of Australian Resources series; in particular, the
most recent Vegetation volume (AUSLIG 1990). Australia is, as
the result of considerable past efforts, a well-mapped continent.
This raft of resource knowledge supports not only government policies
but also public debate about those policies. We hope that this
compact disk, and its summary in printed format, Graetz et al,
(1995), will also contribute to a better understanding of the
Australian continent.<HR>

<H3>Satellite Images: </H3>

<P>
<B>The new view of Earth.</B> 
<P>
This section is an extract from <A HREF="../refs.htm">&quot;Looking back&quot; by Graetz et al 1992</A>
. It is an overview of some of the principles of interpeting satellite
imagery. <HR>

<P>
What is special about satellite images?
<P>
My answer is everything.
<P>
Satellite images are really something different: They are unique
and immensely powerful in conveying information about the environment.
<P>
Satellite images are powerful not in themselves but in the way
that they empower every one of us who has the opportunity to use
them. To examine a satellite image of your own city, town or farm,
is to experience something that virtually no one else has done.
You become one of the very few; a genuine minority member. You
have experienced a new and potent view of your country.
<P>
Genuine hands-on access to satellite images was very limited until
quite recently. This restricted access is the consequence of a
lack of awareness and easy public availability. I believe the
lack of access to satellite images by the Australian public has
crippled contemporary environmental debate.
<P>
What is the best way to describe the view of life on Earth that
satellite images can provide?
<P>
It is difficult to find the words to convey my enthusiasm and
excitement for satellite images because so many of the powerful
words that were once reserved for special occasions are now used
for the ordinary and the commonplace.
<P>
Let me start by admitting that each time I examine a satellite
image, I am excited by and engrossed in what I see. No matter
what part of Earth is captured by the image, I am enthralled by
the information that space images convey to me, and captivated
by their novelty and magnificence.
<P>
My response to space images is not only from my head. It is not
just the information content of space images that excites me.
My sense of delight is also involved because the view of Earth
from space is intrinsically beautiful and enchanting.
<P>
I have had this affair with satellite images for two decades.
It began with love at first sight in 1972. My passion remains
as strong as ever. I still can recall the excitement of the first
encounter, and the feeling of disbelief at what was captured by
a lifeless machine onboard a spacecraft 900 km out in space that
was (and still is) ceaselessly circling the planet.
<P>
I know that I am not alone in my feelings. I know of many others
who also appreciate the beauty of space images or who use their
power to communicate ideas and information. I am very confident
that I can convey at least some of my enthusiasm for the space
view of Earth and convince you of its potential.
<P>
Let me begin to infect you with this excitement and sense of wonder
by examining the following satellite image.
<P>
<A HREF="simpson.gif"><IMG SRC="simpsons.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<P>
This is a marvellous image of part of the Simpson Desert, NT.
This space image is approximately 30 000 km2 in area and it captures
how this remote part of Australia looked from 900 km out in space
on June 7, 1981. There is spectacular and intriguing pattern within
this image. The patterns of colour and texture are the consequence
of natural processes that have been operating in these landscapes
over the last million years or so. To me, the most eye catching
patterns are those which are the most recent; they were generated
in only the last ten years or so. Are you able to interpret the
image and identify these patterns as well as speculate on their
causes? This image was deliberately chosen to be strange and mysterious,
although the details of the landscape are still discernible.
<P>
Details: The image identification is WRS 107-077, 22328-00052,
07/06/81. The image size is 91.5 km by 86.2 km, or ~7, 890 km2.
<P>
The next image does not offer quite such a synoptic view , but
it is spectacular nonetheless, and instantly recognisable.
<P>
<A HREF="kakcut.gif"><IMG SRC="kakcuts.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<P>
It is an image of a Dry Season wildfire in Arnhem Land, NT, as
recorded by an imaging system called the Multi-Spectral Scanner
(MSS) onboard spacecraft number 5 of the Landsat satellite series
at 0930 hours AEST on September 2, 1986. This looks just like
a fire viewed from an aircraft. Remember, this image was recorded
900 km above the surface of Australia.
<P>
Details: The image identification is WRS 104-069, ID 58267-00414,
02/09/86.
<P>
If you examine the image closely, you can discern a great deal
of detail about the fire: the actively burning fire front, the
many smoke plumes, and the colours and shapes of the unburned
landscape as well as the fire footprint (scar) left behind as
the fire advances.
<P>
I still find it an amazing realisation that this scene was recorded
by an imaging device onboard the Landsat spacecraft, which is
the size of a Volkswagen sedan car, orbiting the Earth some 900
kilometres above that fire.
<P>
The steps in the process were these. First, sunlight was reflected
from the fire through the atmosphere to the spacecraft where it
was optically captured and converted to a coded electrical signal.
This signal was in turn converted to a radio signal that was transmitted
back to Earth, received at Alice Springs and converted back to
an electrical signal. The very long sequence of electrical signals
that comprise this image was stored as numbers on a magnetic tape.
I purchased a copy of that magnetic tape and, using a computer
and other hardware, converted the electronically coded numbers
into light signals that were focussed onto optical film. The result
is the image you have just examined.
<P>
By using relatively simple technology we can in effect put ourselves
into the Landsat spacecraft to obtain this remarkable view of
the Earth.
<P>
This view is an awe inspiring panorama, the like of which is entirely
unobtainable on Earth.
<P>
<A HREF="history.htm">What is more, the image that we are analysing will never die</A><B>.</B>

<P>
What was happening on the ground in Kakadu National Park on the
morning of September 2, 1986 is stored on magnetic tape in several
locations. Forever into the future, this image can be recalled
and reanalysed whenever and wherever anyone is interested.
<P>
<A HREF="trees.gif"><IMG SRC="treess.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<P>
With these thoughts in mind, what else can be interpreted from
the wildfire image? What other information can be extracted?
<P>
With a little thought and no specialised knowledge, it is possible
to infer other details of this wildfire and of the environmental
conditions at 0930 hours AEST on September 2, 1986. For example,
it is possible to determine which direction is North and then
decide the direction as well as the speed of the prevailing wind
on that morning. The second answer follows from the first. The
first answer can be arrived at by recalling the time of Landsat
overpass, then deducing where in the sky the sun will be. The
location of the shadows of the smoke plumes is useful here.
<P>
After answering these questions, at least two others become obvious:
What size is this fire or what is the scale of the image and why
is the smoke grey-white while the land surface is yellow-red?
<P>
To satisfactorily answer these and other questions about the nature
of satellite images, it is useful to step back from the detail
and think about this topic in a general way. What is special about
the view of Earth from space?
<P>
This question began this section; the title of which suggests
that the view from space is a <A HREF="space.htm">new view</A><B>.</B>
That is correct. It is a new view but it is new in two ways: it
is new in time and it is new in experience. The novelty to the
human experience is the more important.
<P>
The view from space is above all; an un-human view. It represents
a perspective of planet Earth that was until 1972 absolutely external
to the human experience throughout our entire existence as a species.
<P>
Besides the attribute of newness, in what other ways does the
view of Earth from space differ from the everyday one of human
experience? Four differences are particularly significant and
critical to developing an appreciation of, and familiarity with
satellite images.
<P>
The first and most obvious of the differences between the view
from space and our view of planet Earth is in perspective. The
spacecraft imaging devices look straight down at the surface from
a great height with monoscopic vision. They use only one eye,
so to speak. This perspective is in sharp contrast to our view
of Earth that is oblique, from a very low level and in stereo.
This oblique, stereoscopic view is processed by our brains to
provide (relative) distance and context information. This is how
we judge distance and height. Using stereo pairs of aerial photographs,
this human capability has proved remarkably useful and accurate
in assessing apparent height. Over the last 50 years, much of
the topography of the land surface of the Earth has been laboriously
mapped in this way.
<P>
<A HREF="grasses.gif"><IMG SRC="grassess.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<P>
The second important difference between the view from space and
our view of planet Earth is in spatial resolution. With our imaging
system the human eye we capture the world as a dense array of
points, each of which is infinitely small. This array is combined
by our brain to form an image with considerable detail. In addition,
we have used our brains in other ways to enhance the spatial resolution
of the eye with microscopes, telescopes and spectacles. In contrast
to the array of infinitely small points resolved by the human
eye, the spatial resolution of the satellite sensor discussed
here resolves the Earth's surface into points that are about 60
x 80 metres in size. This means that all the spatial detail within
that 60 x 80 metres area is lost because it is represented only
in an averaged way. This smearing or averaging of <A HREF="limits.htm">spatial detail</A><B>
</B>is a new way of thinking about what you are seeing. With experience,
this concept will becomes less disquieting.
<P>
The third important difference between the view from space and
our view of planet Earth, is its spectral characteristics. Satellite
imaging systems are designed to record the world in spectral wavebands,
or colours, that are very different from our visual system. Therefore
an obvious and correct conclusion to draw is that the colours
of satellite images must be 'false'. The colours in the satellite
images used in this book are not 'true' in human terms even though
they are natural.
<P>
The fourth, last, and most un-human characteristic of satellite
data is that it is acquired by machines: machines that are designed
to acquire data <A HREF="newtruth.htm">objectively and repetitively</A><B>.</B>
These two adjectives, objectively and repetitively, say it all
because they describe the two characteristics of satellite image
data that contribute the most to assessing or monitoring the environment.
<P>
It is the two characteristics of objectivity and repetition that
have encouraged me to devote my research career to encouraging
the use of satellite data for monitoring the Australian environment
and for renewable resource management.
<P>
Of the four characteristics of satellite data discussed, by far
the most critical to us are the spectral and spatial properties.
It is these two features that underpin the obvious questions asked
of the wildfire image above: what size is this fire or what is
the scale of the image and why is the smoke grey-white while the
land surface is yellow-red?
<P>
The first of these two questions is the easiest to answer and
it will help introduce the more difficult answer to the second
question.
<P>
The size of the fire and the scale of the wildfire can be calculated
by looking at the whole satellite image, of which the fire area
was but a small part. An entire image from the MSS imaging device
of the Landsat satellite series measures 185 x 185 kilometres
and is therefore about 34, 000 square kilometres in area.

<P>
The entire image of the Dry Season wildfire in Arnhem Land, NT,
as recorded by Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) at 0930 hours
Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) on September 2, 1986.
The centre of this scene is 13&#176; 2' South, 133&#176; 29' East.
<P>
Details: The image identification is WRS104-069, ID = 58267-00414,
02/09/86. The image size is 185 km by 185 km, or ~34,225 km2.
<P>
Obviously this wildfire was not the only one burning in this part
of the Northern Territory on this date. Several smaller fires
are visible, and you can easily detect the footprints of others.
A close examination of the surface shows it criss-crossed with
enormous cracks or fissures. Each of these fissures is filled
with a crimson ribbon of rainforest. The view from space shows
us the bones of the country. This image gives us an insight into
the geological forces that shape the Arnhem Land plateau. It is
not difficult to speculate as to the how and why of these huge
cracks. Also, if I tell you that the eastern edge of this image
covers part of Kakadu National Park, then you will be able to
interpret the nature and location of one of this Park's most spectacular
attractions.
<P>
Even though the image was acquired in September, The Dry season
in the NT, it is not unreasonable to expect that at least part
of the landcover, the vegetation would be green. If the colour
of the smoke plumes in these two images is white and that of the
fire footprint is black, both of which are natural colours, why
is the landcover yellow-red and not green? The colours that we
see in this image are not the same as we experience on the ground.
<P>
Very simply, the answer to all these questions is the same. The
colours of this image are false.
<P>
There are good reasons why it is necessary to use false colours
in space images. It is necessary now to include a little more
detail of the process by which space images are acquired and displayed.
The principal issues are the spatial and spectral representations
of the surface of the Earth.
<P>
The sensors onboard satellites image the Earth's surface by optically
capturing the sunlight reflected from the surface through the
atmosphere. This imaging process is not the same as a camera that
records all the scene (field of view) at the instant the shutter
is activated. Rather, the imaging device samples the reflected
sunlight continuously by scanning across the direction (path)
of the satellite's movement.
<P>
As the satellite moves in its orbit, so the imaging device scans
the land surface 900 km or so below. Each scanning unit is a pixel
(picture element). In the Landsat satellite series this scanning
is effected by a moving mirror. The overall process is not very
different from that used in digital 35 mm cameras. It is just
that the satellite imaging systems operating at the height they
do must be uncommonly accurate and precise.
<P>
All satellite imaging devices do not record the reflected solar
radiation from the Earth's surface in all wavelengths (colours).
Rather, they are designed to filter the incoming light into a
limited number of groups of wavelengths (wavebands) to reduce
the amount of data that have to be recorded to that which is of
most interest. For example the Landsat MSS instrument that provided
almost all the images in this book records the reflected light
from the surface in just four wavebands.
<P>
The four channels of data created by the MSS device are mysteriously
named MSS#4 - MSS#7, rather than MSS#1 - MSS#4, because there
once was an associated imaging device called the Return Beam Vidicon
(RBV) that generated the absent channels #1 - #3.
<P>
The <A HREF="summary.htm">four wavebands</A><B> </B>are described
by the range of wavelengths of light that the filtering devices
let through. As an example, the MSS#4 waveband includes all wavelengths
of light from 500 - 600 nanometres (nm), where a nanometre is
one billionth (0.000000001) of a metre.
<P>
<I>The wildfire scene that we examined earlier is presented here
as four black &amp; white images: one for each of the four MSS
wavebands. The grey tone in each image is a linear measure of
the reflectance of the landscape: the brighter the tone, the greater
is the reflectance (brightness) of the landscape in that waveband.
The information in these four images is contained in the differences
between images. For example, check out how the brightness of the
rainforests within the fissures changes between MSS wavebands.</I>

<A HREF="kak7.gif"><IMG SRC="kak7s.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A> 
<P>
MSS Band 7 Near Infrared (800-1100 nm)
<P>
I have associated a colour with each of the first two MSS wavebands
(MSS#4 = green, MSS#5 = red), but it is important to remember
that colour is a psycho-physical phenomenon. It is a human definition
and a concept derived from the structure and functioning of our
eyes combined with the processing of this information by our brains.
<P>
Colour is not an objective physical phenomenon.
<P>
The wavelengths of radiation perceived by human eyes (400 - 700
nm) are collectively called visible light. Human eyes have their
peak sensitivities in the yellow-green, this is most probably
a consequence of the evolutionary history of hominids that began
in canopies of rainforest trees.
<P>
The important point is that visible light is not in any physical
way different from those wavelengths that we cannot see, eg. the
near-infra red channels MSS#6 and MSS#7, nor from the thermal
wavelengths that we can feel as heat but are also unable to see.
<P>
Why are wavelengths that we cannot see imaged by satellites?
<P>
There are two explanations. The first is related to the scattering
properties of the atmosphere that is always in between the spacecraft
and the earth's surface. The scattering of light by the atmosphere
generates fuzzy images of little value. The smaller wavelengths,
MSS#4 and MSS#5, are more affected by this <A HREF="colours.htm">atmospheric scattering</A><B>
</B>than the longer ones, MSS#6 &amp; MSS#7. Thus one explanation
for recording reflected radiation outside the visible wavebands
is the provision of images least affected by atmospheric haze.
<P>
The second and more important explanation why satellite imaging
devices record wavelengths to which the human eye is not sensitive
is that outside our visible world some really interesting things
occur. Various parts of the landscape are very reflective (bright)
or poorly reflective (dull) in different wavelengths. These differences
in the reflectance characteristics of soil, plants, water, shadows,
etc, in the non-visible wavebands are a little difficult to comprehend
at first contact because they are outside our experience.
<P>
It is helpful to begin with an example: vegetation.
<P>
Actively growing vigorous plant leaves are quite familiar in the
visible: they appear green because they are very reflective (bright)
in the green wavelengths (ie. MSS#4) and poorly reflective (dull)
in the red (MSS#5). Outside our visible world, instruments tell
us that these plant leaves are very bright in the near infrared
wavebands, MSS#6 &amp; MSS#7. As leaves become older and less
vigorous, they lose their high reflectivity in the near infrared.
<P>
On the basis of this information on the spectral attributes of
vegetation in the MSS wavebands, we could design a test for green
vegetation. If a target was dull (poorly reflective) in the red
(MSS#5) as well as being bright (highly reflective) in the near
infrared (MSS#6 or MSS#7), then that target is actively growing
vegetation.
<P>
This test for vegetation is straightforward reasoning from what
we know about reflectance.
<P>
Note that the test did not use the one characteristic that we
humans use to decide whether vegetation is green or not, its colour.
The green waveband (MSS#4) was not used at all.
<P>
The high reflectance in the near infrared of growing vegetation
is not apparent to the human eye in any way; this has been exploited
in military activities involving camouflage.
<P>
Camouflage is non-living plant material, eg. canvas, coloured
and shaped to resemble foliage, used to cover equipment from hostile
attack. Well-made camouflage can mislead the trained but unaided
eye. So the unaided human eye was assisted by a special photographic
film with dyes sensitive in the near-infrared wavelengths. The
photographic image collected on this camouflage-detection film
clearly showed real vegetation as bright and false vegetation
as dull.
<P>
The near infrared wavebands of spacecraft imaging devices are
designed for the same reasons but for a very different purpose.
The non-colour wavebands are included to provide information about
the condition or vigour of vegetation. The spectral characteristics
of landscape components other than vegetation will be discussed
as they occur in later images.
<P>
There is one remaining step to answer the most puzzling question
that flowed from our wildfire image: given that the colours are
false, why is the land surface yellow-red?
<P>
This step completes the loop from sunlight reflected from the
surface of the Earth, its electronic capture by the imaging device
onboard the satellite to the coloured prints in this book.
<P>
The MSS imaging device electronically records a scene as an array
of numbers which represent the brightness values of the Earth's
surface in each of the four wavebands for every pixel. This array,
about 28 000 000, was relayed to a ground receiving station. Here
these numbers were <A HREF="endless.htm">archived</A><B> </B>on
magnetic tape, carefully preserving their spatial pattern.
<P>
A useful analogy at this point is to think of an image as being
a mosaic or jigsaw puzzle of very tiny identically shaped tiles.
The brightness value of each tile, in each of four colours, is
recorded as a digital number (DN) between 0 and 255. The image
mosaic will only retain its information content if the spatial
pattern of the four brightness numbers is preserved absolutely,
that is the spatial correspondence between the brightness values
for each of the four wavebands is retained for every one of the
28 000 000 pixels.
<P>
The next procedure is to take the array of numbers stored on magnetic
tape which has no meaning for the human eye, and faithfully recreate
an image. This image must be an exact spatial and spectral copy
of the original scene. The human eye and brain are superbly efficient
at analysing the spatial patterns of colours that make up an image.
In a few ways, the human capacity for image analysis still cannot
be matched by a computer.
<P>
If the spatial pattern of the pixels can be preserved and displayed,
what options are there to display the spectral information?
<P>
The most common method of colouring the image is to combine the
colours in an additive way. That is, the primary colours of blue,
green and red are combined on a black background to generate the
colour spectrum. The additive mixing process is controlled by
the recorded intensities, the DN values, of the reflected light
in three channels of the satellite image. In recreating an image,
the DNs control the intensities of spots of blue, green and red
light focussed onto a photographic film in a hardcopy output device.
<P>
With four original channels of data in the original MSS image
and only three primary colours available, a choice in the assignment
of colour to waveband must be made.
<P>
For Landsat MSS, the most frequent assignment of colours to MSS
waveband intensities is blue to MSS#4, green to MSS#5 and red
to MSS#7. The data in MSS#6 are thus ignored. For any one of the
millions of pixels in the output image, the recorded brightness
(DN) of the land surface in MSS#4 (green) controls the amount
of blue colour added. The DN for MSS#5 (red) controls the amount
of green added to each pixel in the image and the MSS#7 (near
infrared) DN controls the amount of red.
<P>
Recreating an image by using colour additive mixing and this colour
assignment results in a traditional False Colour Composite (FCC)
image.
<P>
It is not the only way of recreating an MSS image. It is possible
to use a subtractive rather than additive colour mixing process
in which the yellow, magenta and cyan primaries subtract from
a white background to generate the colour spectrum. In addition,
the colour assignment between MSS channels is variable because
there are 22 different possible ways of combining three channels
from four. All of the 22 combinations will produce a false colour
composite image. The choice finally depends on the gamut of colours
the interpreter prefers.
<P>
Finally, let's complete the loop that we challenged ourselves
with after examining the wildfire image. Why, in that image is
the land surface yellow-red?
<P>
The explanation now seems simple. If we had an area of landscape
in the NT on the morning of September 2, 1986 that had a cover
of green vigorous vegetation, it would have been recorded as bright
in the near infrared wavebands (MSS#6 and MSS#7).
<P>
Therefore when we come to translate this digital record back into
hardcopy and colours, green, vigorous vegetation will appear red
in the output FCC image.
<P>
The Landsat image <A HREF="landsat.htm">archive for Australia</A>
began in late 1972 with the launch of Landsat-1. As I write, Landsat-5
is the operational satellite that is still steadily and systematically
observing the Earth using both the MSS and the Thematic Mapper
(TM) imaging systems.
<P>
The MSS imaging system will eventually be replaced by the Thematic
Mapper (TM) imaging system that has higher spatial resolution,
30 x 30 metre pixel size rather than the 60 x 80 metres of MSS,
and higher spectral resolution, operating with seven spectral
wavebands rather than the four of the MSS system. The MSS system
has acquired data that now form an enormous image archive of the
Earth. The total number of images is not precisely known, but
it is more than 2 million.
<P>
The principal imaging device aboard Landsat 1-5 has been the MSS.
With the launch of Landsat-4 in 1983, the Thematic Mapper (TM)
was added to the payload with higher spectral and spatial resolution
but with the same swathe width and revisit time.
<P>
In summary: Satellite images are unique and extremely powerful
in conveying information about the environment. They are unusual
and unfamiliar because the view that they provide is new and challenging.
We can use that view to provide an objective assessment of the
state of environment twenty years ago and as it is today. Satellite
data are a <A HREF="newtruth.htm">new truth</A><B> </B>and a <A HREF="history.htm">new history</A><B>.</B>
We can use it to detect the changes that have taken place over
that time span and to determine whether those changes were for
the better, benign, or for the worse. We can objectively determine
the rates of change, the spatial location of change and, most
importantly, who was responsible for that change. The management
of the Earth has never had such a powerful tool at its disposal,
yet that tool resides 900 kilometres out in space.<HR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Airborne Sensing at CSIRO Water Resources</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><B>1. INTRODUCTION<BR></B><BR>The work done at CSIRO Division of Water Resources (DWR), based on the Itres(Canada) CASI airborne spectral imaging instrument, is an Applications Basedsystems development. This development is a package consisting of an IntegratedAirborne (spectral) Sensing (IAS) instrument, ancillary instrumentationand processing modules. Together, these can provide high resolution informationfor environmental resource assessment in a form immediately useful to endusers of the products. The Applications area defined for this IAS involvesintegrating models and methods based on CSIRO DWR core knowledge and skillswith a general system comprising data collection instruments, processingmethodologies and processing hardware and software systems.<BR><BR><B>2. APPLICATIONS AREA MODEL</B><BR>The outputs of the Applications system are final products that users wantand are prepared to contract commercially to a processing service bureau.The necessary Application template for an imaging spectrometer such as (butnot limited to) the CASI, takes into account the special circumstances providedby a fully calibrated spectral instrument. It integrates its output witha range of other airborne and ground based measurements and has nine maincomponents.<BR><BR><I><A HREF="../gifs/dis1fig.gif">Figure 1. Simplified Applications AreaStructure Schematic</A></I><BR><BR>The subcomponents (primary processes) of this system have been studied ina detailed form as a cost/time and work/duration processing model throughapplications carried out by the established processing group at CSIRO DWR.That model and possible extensions based on queuing theory have been investigatedat CSIRO DWR and by CSIRO DWR's commercial product developers as part ofthe Applications model. This model has been set up to help manage and monitorthe progress of actual Applications projects. Figure 1 shows the main structureof the model:<BR><BR><B>2.1</B> <B>Flight Mission (Planning and Execution)</B><BR>Every application will have special considerations with respect to channelschosen for targeting user needs, environmental conditions, data scale andresolution. CSIRO DWR uses a set of software items which implement the flightplanning and measurement models. These can be used to plan prior to flightsand during the mission.<BR><BR><B>2.2</B> <B>Lab and Field Data Collection &amp; </B>Processing<BR>Some field data are collected at the time of each mission and some at othertimes. Data which must be taken at the time of flights is environmental(such as atmospheric data). Data such as characteristic spectra can be collectedat other times. Separation of field and laboratory from flying missionsis a key development in the measurement model approach being discussed here.Software to analyse the Lab and Field data for each measurement model forthe analyses have been developed to implement this area.<BR><BR><B>2.3</B> <B>Base Data </B>Processing<BR>CASI Suppliers (Itres, Canada) software is used to take image, attitude(roll and pitch) and GPS data from the aircraft and process them to calibratedand (by single run) geometrically resampled images in a form ready for imageprocessing. There is a future need to develop software to use the GPS datato more effectively and accurately model the attitude of the aircraft forIAS applications. This is under development by CSIRO DWR in combinationwith Itres and the CSIRO DWR commercial product developers.<BR><BR><B>2.4 Mosaicking and Normalisation</B><BR>The Base Processed airborne sensor data are assembled into mosaicks andatmospherically corrected in this component. Atmospheric correction meansthe data from different runs and times become normalised to surface reflectance.Only real differences in surface reflectance are left. At the heart of thisprocess is an integrated spectral and geometric model for the data. Thismodel is also the basis for fusion of the data with other data types - suchas satellite data, other airborne data and GIS data at various scales.<BR><BR><B>2.5 Image Processing</B><BR>The necessary functions of the image processing system can be fully describedby function rather than by options in any single image processing system.At present, microBRIAN (MPA and CSIRO developed software) is being usedfor the CASI based prototype Projects. The use of this specific softwarefor an advanced IAS is sufficient but not necessary. CSIRO DWR supervisingsoftware exists for the current system which makes processing tasks quickerand minimises operator action.<BR><BR><B>2.6 Measurement Models</B><BR>The primary taxonomy of 'applications' from the Application system pointof view is by measurement model. At present there are an atmospheric andsix main surface measurement models:<BR>n water bodies and water covered targets (eg sea grass, reefs, water quality)<BR>n dense woody vegetation (eg forests &amp; mangroves)<BR>n open forests &amp; woodlands (eg woody weeds)<BR>n short grass and crops (eg crops and grasslands)<BR>n bare targets (eg soils)<BR>n (modulated by) flat and sloping ground effects<BR>The measurement models provide the link between the parameters of interestand concern to the user and those of direct significance in forming thesignal measured by the instrument. The CASI measures radiance in the visibleand near infrared so that CASI measurement models involve primarily radiativetransfer and scattering in the surface layer and atmosphere. However, userswant to know parameters of the surface such as canopy cover and structure,soil moisture, water use, levels of phytoplankton in water bodies, benthiccommunity type or suspended sediments concentration. The measurement modelsprovide the scale and physical basis for these transfers from CASI datato the information required by the end user.<BR><BR><B>2.</B>7 <B>Measurement Model Knowledge Base</B><BR>This area includes a Spectral Library and associated environmental information.The data structure and methodology for the Spectral Data Base has been developedat CSIRO DWR. The Measurement Model Knowledge Base, together with softwarecalled the 'Data Calculator', form base tools for the measurement modelsand applications. In particular, a spectral library is a primary tool fortemplate matching and data modelling.<BR><BR><B>2.</B>8 <B>GIS Integration</B><BR>The system needs two-way access to GIS data and tools. The image processingcomponent must also have adequate data integration tools to do this. Currently,CASI based Projects interface to ArcInfo and GRASS. This component can,however, be any adequate commercial GIS system. There is benefit in it beingoff-the-shelf. In land operations, this area of the Applications Model mustalso provide the best current DTM system data as well as cadastral information.<BR><BR><B>2.</B>9 <B>Interpretation</B><BR>Interpretation is the action of merging the information and products ofmodelling and image processing to derive the final products in the termsthe end user needs. It involves skilled and experienced scientists labellingclasses, attaching numerical levels and statistics and generating keys andsummaries. The interpretation depends on the Application and on the typeof models that have been employed. This area is a key component in the Applicationsbased approach and the accumulated experience here will grow as an assetof any commercial implementation of the model. Final results will normallybe included in a developing GIS and build a base of decision support forfuture missions to use.<BR><BR><B>2.10 Applications Products</B><BR>This area involves Report Generation, product generation and annotationand product delivery and presentation. This area can use existing hardwareand software, the tools in the Image Processing System and the GIS systemas well as new software. In the current CASI based prototype, most of thesefunctions are provided by the microBRIAN image processing system, CorelDrawand standard publication tools such as Microsoft Word, Chartist and MathType.<BR>We can itemise the current set of specialised product areas for the Applicationsunder five headings. These are: <BLOCKQUOTE><UL><LI>Coastal zone monitoring and mapping <LI>Reef and seagrass mapping and monitoring <LI>Water quality mapping and monitoring <LI>Forest monitoring and mapping <LI>Plant community determination and monitoring. </UL></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><B>3. IMPLEMENTATION</B><BR>In projects undertaken at CSIRO DWR, the system described above has beenimplemented by a well equipped and trained team of remote sensing specialists.The cost structures have been analysed as well as processing managementand potential efficiencies identified. There is now a very good processingmanagement and planning model which can be keyed into a commercial businessplan to provide effective commercial planning and management. This establishedteam and its commercial product developers are equipped to work togetherwith other service groups throughout our region.<BR>The current systems implementation and structure is under review with thecommercial product developers and has a number of efficiency and throughputgoals which will improve commercial operations. <BR><HR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY><HR><H2><CENTER>Land AVHRR Data Users Group Workshop -<BR>Towards Product Standards</CENTER></H2><HR><H4>2. THE ISSUE OF STANDARDS IN AVHRR DATA USE</H4><BR>From the scientific viewpoint, there has been a significant progressionfrom the type of research paper presented in the inaugural ARSC1 in 1979to the present ARSC8 in 1996. The mass centre of such presentations hasmoved from descriptive work through exploratory research to a point whereadvanced measurement based models are being effectively used with remotelysensed data and widely reported. Remote Sensing is truly becoming a measurementbased activity. Among the international scientific community this progressis well in train as you will hear from a number of the scientists speakingtoday.<BR><BR>However, at the user end, is there evidence of as much progress? If thereis, then it would be seen in a progression from the research question of&quot;What <I>might</I> AVHRR do for me?&quot; to the operational issueof &quot;What <I>does</I> AVHRR do for me?&quot;. This last question involvesthe development of well defined products and standards as well as well establishedmethods for creating products of value to specific end users. This is notso much an issue for research as for specification.<BR><BR>Nevertheless, researchers cannot ignore the issue of standards. Standardsare needed if the AVHRR user industry is to leave R&amp;D 'school' and jointhe much more engineering oriented 'workplace'. Engineering based standardsdefine what levels of processed data product are needed and what methodsof value added processing ensure a product with a guaranteed accuracy orutility can be delivered. Such standard specifications are needed to protectdata and product suppliers and users. They are also essential tools withwhich end users can cost the use of remotely sensed data and value addinginto major projects. I claim that the lack of these is the biggest hurdleto acceptance of our efforts at this time and more vital to us than theneed to do more advanced research.<BR>Ideally, standard data products, data processing and interpretation methodsshould be: <UL><LI>specifiable <LI>repeatable <LI>consistent <LI>testable by well defined measures, and <LI>[not data or situation dependent] </UL>The last of these is desirable rather than essential.<BR><BR>The standard procedures with such characteristics that are needed in ourindustry are also of two basic kinds. The first is for data delivery suchas from an operational receiving station. These are typically set in a 'Levels'framework and for each level there are a set of specifications and measuresof performance. Perhaps these are not as well developed and consistentlydeliverable in Australia as they should be. The second are for value addedproducts. These may need manuals of standard practice which, if followed,provide products of a proven standard. Of course, the standard may seemquite low to many scientists but I believe the current lack of them is causingproblems for researchers and users alike.<BR><HR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="wshop1.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="wshop3.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY><HR><H2>Image Brightness &amp; BRDF Workshop Issues<BR><HR></H2><H4><BR>1. ATMOSPHERIC &amp; SCENE BRIGHTNESS VARIATIONS</H4>Optical, shortwave and thermal image data from airborne and satellite platformshave varying degrees of angle dependent brightness variation which changewith the sun position, atmospheric conditions, land surface type and sensorcharacteristics. If left uncorrected, these broad level variations can makeit difficult to use the data with standard image processing and interpretationmethods.<BR><BR>For example, a Daedalus airborne scanner has a scan angle of &#177;38&#176;and if flown with the sun at an azimuth away from 'in front' or 'behind'(i.e. away from the Principal Plane) this will result in significant imagebrightness variations created by the atmospheric component phase functionsand any surface angle dependent reflectance effects. The reflectance functiondescribing the surface effects is the Bi-Directional Reflectance DistributionFunction, or BRDF. These atmospheric and surface effects are present inall satellite data as well as aerial photography and video data to a greateror lesser degree depending on the variation in the phase angle between thesun, target and sensor among the pixels in the resulting image. Topographyenters into the equation in a way that depends on scale (or pixel size)leading to quite complex variations in an image being scanned as illustratedin <B><A HREF="brdff1.htm">Figure 1</A> </B>even if the surface type werehomogeneous.<BR><BR>The atmosphere contributes to the total effect partly due to the varyingpath length at different parts of the scan and partly to the atmosphericscattering phase variation described by the composite phase function ofthe atmospheric constituents. This describes the way radiation is scatteredout of a volume relative to the direction it enters. In optical remote sensing,air molecules and aerosols account for much of the scattering and the effectsare greatest at shorter wavelengths. Hence, if the aerosol atmospheric turbidityis high, the atmospheric brightening in (say) the blue-green will be visibleand significant in most remotely sensed data. In the thermal bands, theangular variation is almost all due to the changing path length and themajor atmospheric effect is due to water vapour on the path.<BR><BR>The land surface contributes to the broad level brightness variations commonto all remotely sensed images. The base 'colour' and brightness is a functionof the spectral properties of the material types making up the scene (e.g.leaf reflectances and transmittances or soil grain mineralogy) plus structuraleffects which give rise to the angular variations. The angular effects canbe ascribed to three main factors - the volume effect, the occlusion (orhotspot) effect and the specular or glint effect: <UL><LI><B>Volume Effect</B>: Because of the changes in path lengths and extinctionin complex surfaces as the relative sun and look angles change, there isa volume BRDF which has some similarity to the atmospheric phase functioninduced variations. It will depend on surface structure and in vegetationit depends on factors like leaf density variations and angle distributionsas well as total leaf area. <LI><B>Occlusion Effect</B>: The occlusion effect is a more specific effectinduced by the fact that the shadows cast by the sun represent parts ofthe surface that are not 'seen' by the sun. The areas that are not 'seen'by the sensor which are also not 'seen' by the sun are the common areasbetween shadow cast by the sun if it were in the two positions. The varyingoverlap induces a brightness variation as when the sun and sensor are aligned,no shadows are 'seen' and the scene seems bright and when the look angleis opposite to the sun many shadows are 'seen' leading to lower brightness.<LI><B>Specular (or Glint) Effect</B>: The specular or glint effect is mostpronounced on water surfaces. It refers to the surface 'mirror' (or Fresnel)reflectance in which the radiation is usually unaltered by the surface materialfrom which it is reflected. On land surfaces it is a composite of reflectionsdiffused from facets of varying angular positions and specularity. In Australia,Eucalypt leaves are especially specularly reflective due to their waxy coating.On water, glint is probably the major component of the BRDF and the hotspoteffect does not occur. </UL>The sum of these effects in remotely sensed data is an image brightnessvariation that is a sum of the atmospheric brightness and the scene brightness.The atmospheric and surface effects also interact to provide a compositeeffect that varies with sun, target &amp; sensor geometry. The effects aremore obvious in aerial photography and video images where the central perspectivemeans that at high sun angles the hotspot and specular points are withinthe angular radius of the frame. For airborne scanners and satellite bornescanners it is possible to avoid the brightest hotspot and glint pointsby careful consideration of the scan geometry but since the variations aresignificant for all angles the effects cannot be ignored in any image.<BR><BR>The scene and atmospheric brightness variations are all minimised for ascanner if the sensor data are scanned at right angles to the 'principalplane'. The principal plane is the plane formed by the vectors joining theearths centre to the sensor and to the sun. For an airborne scanner, thismeans flying level, with the sun in front or behind the flight line. Ifthe hotspot or specular points need to be avoided at high sun times, thescanning sensor is sometimes tilted forward or back to ensure it. These'avoiding' strategies are not easily used with photography or video images.<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="brdf1.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf3.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

APPLICATIONS DEMANDING ATTENTION</H4>Applications using images which have wide scan angles or are captured whenthe sun and observer positions are such that these angular variations aresignificant must take them into account or correct the images for them insome way. Examples are: <UL><LI>Single scenes where classification and other image processing is predicatedon consistent values from similar target land or water types; <LI>Mosaics of images which are intended to produce a consistent compositeimage on which spectral (location independent) image processing can be done;and <LI>Multiple images, such as time series where the data must be comparedfor change in the surface that must be detectable over changes due to imagebrightness differences within and/or between images. </UL>In a sense, the objective is to ensure a spatial and temporal 'stationarity'in which a given target with given unchanging reflectance will be the sameat all locations and in all images over the time series. Obviously, thedegree to which this needs to be accomplished depends on the application,and the value of spending time and effort on image correction depends onthe value put on the final product by the client.<BR><BR>From the economic perspective, there will always be <BLOCKQUOTE>1. project planning and management costs;<BR>2. image and ancillary data acquisition costs;<BR>3. data base processing costs;<BR>4. value adding costs;<BR>5. data integration costs; and<BR>6. product presentation costs.</BLOCKQUOTE>The total cost must reflect the value of the product to the end user. Ifthe emphasis is on low costs the effort justified by correcting for, orusing, effects like image brightness variations may be small. On the otherhand, if the accuracy of the product is crucial and the value of the informationis high then extra effort in correcting for image brightness may be fullyjustified. In the face of this, there are a range of approaches and methodsthat can be used to model or correct the type of brightness variations describedabove. Which among them is 'best' will depend on the application and valueof the data.<BR><HR><A HREF="brdf1.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf2.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf4.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif"WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HR></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY><HR><H2>Image Brightness &amp; BRDF Workshop Issues<BR><HR></H2><H4>3. TYPOLOGY OF APPROACHES</H4>The general approach to image brightness is to 'correct' it in some way.Correction means changing a pixel spectrum so that it is what would havebeen measured if the sun and sensor geometry were a fixed standard pairrather than a varying pair of angles over the image extent. As discussedlater, this action may be valid as an average over a spatial area but canbe a difficult concept at the scale of a single tree crown or soil clump.<BR>We will outline three main approaches to scene brightness modelling and'correction'. They are the empirical methods, the measurement modellingmethods and the semi-empirical methods. <H4>3.1 Empirical Methods</H4>Empirical methods involve fitting the variation in general brightness ascribedto the atmosphere and BRDF effects by a parametric function (using leastsquares or some other criterion) and then normalising by some combinationof additive and multiplicative image transformation. The simplest methodsinvolve fitting polynomials to average variations over scanlines or framesand subtracting or dividing out the general level to 'flatten' the data.These methods are well known and have been used with single frame photographsor scanner runs prior to other image processing operations.<BR><BR>For mosaics, brightness normalisation has a strict analogy with geometricmosiacking where images are geometrically matched to the ground by groundcontrol points (ie GCPs) and to other images by tie points. At tie points,in geometric mosaicking, the constraint is that the same feature must belocated at the same point in the geometric frame model. In the same way,in brightness normalisation, there may be targets in some frames of knownreflectance. These are sometimes called 'invariant targets'. When theirreflectance is only assumed from previous work they are sometimes called'pseudo-invariant' targets. These are analogous to GCPs. In the overlapbetween frames, the analogy to tie points are patches or features that areassumed to have the same corrected spectra. For a given functional formof brightness model, the estimation reduces to a linear 'bundle adjustment'.<BR><BR>The greatest problems with the simple empirical approach are image varianceand heterogeneity. It is often extremely difficult to determine which componentsof the variation are atmospheric or BRDF brightening and which are differencesin surface type. The high image spatial variance that is most obvious inhigh resolution images also makes fitting functions very difficult. Anotherproblem is to decide which effects are additive and which are multiplicative.As long as the variation is not too great, the additive approximation isnot too bad but when raw uncalibrated data are used, the interaction betweenadditive and multiplicative effects can be a problem.<BR><BR>For example, calibration and atmospheric correction are linear effects butthe atmospheric terms are angle dependent and vary with incident (<IMG SRC="symbols/sym1.gif" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) and view (<IMG SRC="symbols/sym2.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="9" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) directions. That is, even if the surface werelambertian (with a flat BRDF) the digital data recorded by a scanner inwaveband j (<IMG SRC="symbols/sym11.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN=middleNATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) will be related to the reflectance (<IMG SRC="symbols/sym9.gif"WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) by:<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="symbols/sym3.gif" WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="55" ALIGN=bottomNATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>hence:<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/sym4.gif" WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>where <BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="symbols/sym5.gif" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottomNATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the radiance recorded in waveband j;<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/sym6.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the sun or 'incident' radiation direction;<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/sym7.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the total irradiance at the target; and<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/sym8.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the radiation scattered into the sensor from the atmosphere.</BLOCKQUOTE>The brightness variation described here (which has no surface BRDF effectin that <IMG SRC="symbols/sym9.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=middleNATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is not dependent on sun or view angles) obviously hasboth additive and multiplicative terms which are complex functions of theincident and view angles. When the surface target itself has a strong BRDFeffect the variability will compound.<BR>In the face of this, the empirical methods are generally constrained tobe of low order functional forms that still have the structure of the variationbeing fitted. In this way, it is hoped that variance and image heterogeneityare 'orthogonal' to the function being fitted. In addition, the fittingis best done in the physical framework of the brightness variation - thatis in terms of the phase angles between sun and sensor view angle and betweensensor view angle and the specular vector. There have been many functionsof this type developed such as Walthall, Hapke, Roujean and others. Thesewill be addressed below in the section of semi-empirical methods.<BR>For the purely empirical approach and for small frames such as occur withaerial photography and video data (or even single scanner runs) the mainproblem is scene heterogeneity. There will be scene variations that occurat spatial scales near to or greater than the image and it is very difficultto separate these effects from atmospheric and broad BRDF effects. To illustratethis you can consider an image to be roughly approximated by:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/sym10.gif" WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN=bottomNATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>where <IMG SRC="symbols/sym14.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN=middleNATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the high spatial frequency component, <IMG SRC="symbols/sym12.gif"WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the low frequencycomponent and <IMG SRC="symbols/sym13.gif" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the angular brightness variation. In manyimages, over the extent of a single frame, the low frequency and angularcomponents are not in any way orthogonal. Hence it is near impossible toestimate the angular function from the single frame data. Moving to modelsbased on view geometry and semi-empirical functions can help (Pickup etal., 1995) but essentially some way to bring in the wider spatial contextis needed.<BR><BR>Among empirical methods are also 'referencing' methods. In the case of imagedigitising, a reference approach is to scan an image and scan a reference(white lambertian) standard sheet with the same illumination. The imageis then 'normalised' by subtracting or dividing the reference from the imageto remove lighting based view angle effects. In reconnaissance image datathis is not possible unless a large reference target were to exist and sceneBRDF effects would still remain. <BR><BR>Hick and Ong (Ong et al., 1995) have used a referencing method to extractbrightness variations from video frames by referencing against the backgroundof a Landsat TM image. It may be possible to fit empirical functions tothe residual between the individual frame and the reference image. In thisway, the problem of heterogeneity and correlated spatial frequencies describedabove could be reduced significantly.<BR><BR>It is worth mentioning here that as soon as the empirical methods extendfrom simple functional forms to ones involving image and sun geometry, theprocessing methods start to become more costly. The cost is in extra workregistering images and/or in extra costs associated with collecting attitudeand position (eg INS and GPS) information for the platform. If it is worththis extra cost then it may be worth some extra modelling as discussed below.<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="brdf1.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf3.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf5.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif"WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HR><BR></BODY></HTML>

The added value would be the link this gives to physicalmodels of the relationship between earth parameters of interest and themeasured reflectance. Obviously, a reflectance is closer to a material propertyand therefore resolves the problem of monitoring.<BR><BR>If reference targets in the image have measured reflectances (ie the invariantor pseudo-invariant targets) it is possible to get close to reflectancesfrom the empirical approach. However, it will never be clear how much residualatmosphere and BDRF effect remains. Obviously, most natural targets chosenas 'invariant' will have some BRDF which may not be known and that effectwill be folded into the final image data.<BR><BR>Assuming the data are accurately calibrated to radiances, there are differentways to describe the process of correction. One is as follows:<BR><BR>An equation relating the recorded radiance sensed at altitude h above thetarget to the target reflectance factor is:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image3.gif" WIDTH="312" HEIGHT="52" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>where: <BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="symbols/image4.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the radiance observed by the instrument fromaltitude h, with look (or view) direction <IMG SRC="symbols/sym18.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="9" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">and sun direction<IMG SRC="symbols/sym17.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="9" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">at wavelength <IMG SRC="symbols/lam1.gif" WIDTH="7" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">;<BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image5.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the effective irradiance at the target, or <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image6.gif" WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottomNATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>where: <BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="symbols/image7.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the irradiance at the target for a 'black'earth;<BR>s is the sky hemispherical albedo; and<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/rho.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">* is the background earth albedo.<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image8.gif" WIDTH="48" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the beam transmittance through the layer between the surface andaltitude h in direction mv;<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/rhot.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the target directional reflectance factor;<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image9.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the environmental reflectance due to the background albedo or:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image10.gif" WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P><IMG SRC="symbols/image11.gif" WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the diffuse transmittance for a layer of thickness h and for initialbeam direction mv.<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image12.gif" WIDTH="74" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the path radiance of light which did not interact with the surface;and<BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image13.gif" WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the glint term that is most significantly present over water coveredtargets and is sometimes present over land targets.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>If the atmosphere is characterised then it is possible to retrieve the directionalreflectance factor (<IMG SRC="symbols/rhot.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) for each pixel. This term needs careful definitionas there are many different types of 'reflectance' used.<BR><BR>The directional reflectance factor (<IMG SRC="symbols/rhot.gif" WIDTH="9"HEIGHT="11" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) as used here is defined as:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image14.gif" WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>in which the irradiance (<IMG SRC="symbols/image15.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) is the sum of diffuse and directterms and the fraction of diffuse (fd) is included as a parameter. The assumptionthat the irradiance can be characterised in this context by the sun positionand the fraction of diffuse radiation is one that needs evaluation. Thevalue of using this form of reflectance is that it corresponds to what ismeasured in the field using an irradiance radiometer or a reference standard.<BR><BR>The physical approach depends on two steps. The first is to determine thisreflectance factor for a surface by atmospheric correction. In atmosphericcorrection, the atmospheric terms are modelled and measured from image andancillary data. The reflectance factor in an image may be obtained iterativelyif the atmospheric turbidity makes the adjacency and other atmosphere/surfaceinteractions significant. The second step is to normalise the reflectancefactor in some way to account for its BRDF variation.<BR><BR>In order to go from the reflectance factor to such a corrected value, however,we effectively need to assume that:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image16.gif" WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>where <IMG SRC="symbols/image17.gif" WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middleNATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the angular variation function that is assumed tocharacterise the land surface type and be normalised to 1.0 at a referencepair of sun and view angles and standard atmosphere. Then 'corrected' dataare reachable as:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image18.gif" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>The value of getting to this point is that both <IMG SRC="symbols/image19.gif"WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">and <IMG SRC="symbols/image20.gif"WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">can be interfacedwith radiative transfer models to obtain parameters for the earth's surfaceby inversion. The inversion may be simple (such as end member methods) orsophisticated (such as complete nonlinear modelling).<BR><BR>This physical approach is obviously highly sophisticated but demands a levelof data quality and time in value adding that sometimes cannot economicallybe committed. However, if the end products are of high information valueand valued by the client it is clearly an approach that could be pursued.<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="brdf1.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf4.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf6.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif"WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HR></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY><HR><H2>Image Brightness &amp; BRDF Workshop Issues<BR><HR></H2><BR><B>3.2.2 Analytic BRDF Models<BR></B><BR>Assuming the atmospheric correction can be done (and the surface interactionneeds to be flagged here as the coupling means the atmospheric correctionand surface BRDF estimation are not independent) the surface BRDF can sometimesbe defined by an analytic model.<BR><BR>Among the many models for the volume effect are the Suits and Sail modelsas well as many more sophisticated ones such as the hotspot based modeldescribed (as an example) in Qin and Jupp (1993). The literature is vast(Myneni and Ross, 1990 provides a very good review although it is becomingdated!). <BR><BR>The hotspot effect is a geometric or occlusion effect and from among themany papers that exist describing it the following text has been editiedand extracted from Jupp and Walker (1996).<BR><BR>&quot;A simple model for the remote sensing of a canopy is the GeometricOptical (GO) model. The simple GO (or hotspot) model for scenes which describeopen forest or woodland areas is based on the one described in Jupp et al.(1986), Strahler and Jupp (1991a&amp;b) and Li and Strahler (1992). In thismodel, there are four kinds of ground cover 'visible' from a given direction.These are referred to as scene components and consist of sunlit canopy (symbolsc), shaded canopy (shc), sunlit background (sb), and shaded background(shb). Each component is assumed to have a characteristic radiance and theradiance of a pixel is modelled as the area weighted combination (or linearmixture) of the characteristic component radiances. That is, the observedradiance of a single pixel (rs) is modelled as:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image32.gif" WIDTH="279" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>where the subscripts sc, shc, sb, and shb indicate the radiances of thefour components as named above, Rj represents the (mean) radiance of component'j' and k indicates the sensed proportion of each component within the pixelfrom the given view direction.<BR><BR>The mean radiance over the scene (Rs), assuming the view and sun directionsare constant, can be written as:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image31.gif" WIDTH="304" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>where, capital Kj represents the mean or expected value of the varyingproportions kj over the scene for j as the components sc, shc, sb or shb.The mean value (Rs), as a function of sun and observer position, definesthe BRDF of the scene.<BR><BR>In order for the scene BRDF model to be computed, a description of the sizeand shapes of the objects, their density and how they are distributed overthe background is needed and the geometrical relationships between the objectsand the expected values of the four components must be established. Juppet al. (1986), Strahler and Jupp (1991a&amp;b) and Li and Strahler (1992)describe such a model for spheroidal crown (not necessarily opaque) volumeswhich is valid for any view or illumination angles using the 'Boolean' modelof Serra (1982). In the Boolean model, the object 'centres' are assumedto be randomly distributed in a 'Poisson' distribution. By defining thegeometry and the distributions, expressions for Kj may be derived. Strahlerand Jupp (1991a&amp;b) use a simple model for spheroids which is adequatefor moderate sun and view zenith angles and Li and Strahler (1992) providesome more general alternative models for resolving the Kj. These basic sceneBRDF models are quite simple and are easily implemented in various formssuch as mathematical packages or spreadsheets.<BR><BR>In the woodlands and open forest areas typical of the area of Australiawhere the model studies have been made, the pixel to pixel behaviour ofthe image is conveniently (if not as accurately) described by a simplerform of the model in which the shaded background, sunlit (but still relativelydark) tree and shaded tree components are combined into one so that:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image33.gif" WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>where X is a composite component combining sunlit and shaded tree andshaded background and RX. is computed as:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image35.gif" WIDTH="237" HEIGHT="46" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></CENTER><P>The simpler model has the advantage for this discussion that it showsclearly how, in many woodlands, the image pixel to pixel variation is drivenprimarily by the variation in the proportion of sunlit background whichis visible in the pixels and the contrast between this sunlit backgroundand the other components. It also provides a simple estimate for ksb fromimages where Rsb and RX are known for an appropriate image channel, or channelcombination, as: <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image36.gif" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="45" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>For such a model, the mean radiance (ie BRDF) over all pixels in a patchwith the same basic underlying type of cover and structure is therefore:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image37.gif" WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>where Ksb is the mean value of ksb, or the expected proportion of visiblesunlit background for the particular sun and view positions. <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="brdff2.htm"><IMG SRC="brdff2s.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="113" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER><P><P><CENTER><A HREF="brdff2.htm">Figure 2. DATM Hotspot effect and models</A></CENTER><P>This simple model has been found to be adequate to describe the dataobtained by a Daedalus scanner over woodlands, Figure 2 shows the data averagedover many scanlines for the aircraft scanning in and across the principalplane. The models shown vary the ratio of tree crown diameter to tree height.As can be seen, the models are very sensitive to this ratio which has beenindependently confirmed at the site by ground measurements.<BR><BR>Linear end-member analysis is similar to the estimation of components describedabove. It has been the subject of useful research and application in Australia(Pech et al. 1986, Pickup and Foran 1987) and at regional scales where allpixels are mixtures of land covers of interest (Cross et al., 1991). End-memberanalysis assumes each pixel to be a composition, or mixing, of a few basecomponents or 'end-members'. The pixel signature is assumed to be a linearsum of reflectances from each of n end-members weighted in proportion toits cover (kj) in the pixel:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image40.gif" WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="126" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>End-member analysis seeks to invert this mixing by deriving the proportions(kj) of each component in the pixel signature. This can feasibly be derivedfrom the remotely sensed data provided that if there are n components (trees,shrubs, grass etc) then there are at least (n-1) channels of data that separatethe end-members spectrally. The key assumptions built into the end-membermethod are that: <BLOCKQUOTE>a) The end-members (pure examples of total cover by trees, shrubs,grass and background) are spectrally consistent between sites and <BR><BR>b) Reflectance values for end members (Rj) are available from remotely senseddata or can be accurately derived by other means (such as field spectralmeasurements).</BLOCKQUOTE>There has been considerable work aimed at deriving end-members from thedata (a form of principal components analysis, see Boardman, 1990) and employinghigh spectral resolution data to effect separation of more than a few components(Adams et al., 1989). However, with a lack of available high resolutionspectral data, this linear approach suffers from several significant limitationsto its applicability in Australia: <BLOCKQUOTE>1. Available broad band signatures of the tree and shrub crownsover much of Australia whilst different, are not markedly spectrally distinct.<BR>2. Even if spectrally distinct crowns did exist for the available bands,their distinction is confounded by the effects of shadowing within crownsand cast shadow on the background (with bigger plants shading smaller plants).This makes the signature of the end-members difficult to estimate as thesignature depends on the proportions of crowns and shadows present and variationsin sun and look angles.<BR>3. Relatively low covers of trees and shrubs, together with shadowing, introducesuch high spectral variance into the data relative to the spectral contrastsbetween end-members that the numerical methods used in the end member analysisbecome highly unstable.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Shadow effects obviously depend primarily on the sun angle. Although thecrown cover is the same, lower sun angles clearly decrease image brightness.Differences due to shadowing can be taken into account in end-member analysis,provided the end-member values are recalculated for each temporal imageand one or more components labelled 'shade' are added to the list. However,its successful application still depends on an assumption of linear scalingalong cover gradients due to sun positional and sensor view angle changes.These assumptions in practice are erroneous in structured vegetation (e.g.vegetation with discontinuous cover of trees or shrubs), and this limitsthe application of such methods to general synoptic estimates of changein cover.<BR><BR>It is therefore better to model vegetation cover directly as an assemblageof various sizes and shapes of 3-dimensional objects (trees, shrubs, grasstussocks, herbs, etc.) scattered on a background that may be uniform orheterogeneous (Li and Strahler 1985, Jupp et al. 1986). The GO model maythen be used to model the bidirectional reflectance of the canopies. Inthis approach, the effects due to shadowing on the overall reflectance (orinfrared temperature) from a scene become important and useful featuresand the correlated interactions between shaded and sunlit components arebuilt into the analysis - although it now becomes nonlinear. The directionalradiance of the vegetation is then a mixture of four components (sunlitand shaded tree crowns, and sunlit and shaded backgrounds) that is seenfrom a given viewing angle. The areal proportions of these four components,for given illumination and viewing directions (which can be off-nadir),will be a function of the sizes, shapes, orientations and placements ofthe objects (i.e. individual plants) within the scenes.<BR><BR>A GO model is most appropriate to woodlands or vegetation in which the vegetativecover is discontinuous, that is, where tree and shadowed background interactionsaccount for a large proportion of the variance in the image. The furtheradvantage of these models is that they are also potentially invertible toprovide structural as well as cover information. The invertibility of GOmodels was demonstrated by Strahler et al. (1988), Franklin and Strahler(1988) and Wu and Strahler (1993) in which tree size and density were estimatedfrom reflectance data. When size, shape and orientation are fixed or characterisedby distributions of known parameters, and the object centres are randomlydistributed, then the proportions of the four components can be estimatedusing the Boolean model of Serra (1982). This GO model is termed the Booleanversion (Strahler and Jupp, 1991a&amp;b; Li and Strahler, 1992). It accountsfor the changes in proportions that occur with random overlapping objectsas the density of objects increases and can easily model scale effects andchanging sun and view directions. The GO aspect of the model implies thatmultiple scattering of radiation in the vegetation layer is neglected. Whilethe evidence of our eyes supports this, there are wavelengths (in particularthe near infrared) where multiple scattering is very significant. This hasbeen recently addressed by Li et al. (1995).&quot;<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="brdf1.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf5.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf7.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif"WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HR></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY><HR><H2>Image Brightness &amp; BRDF Workshop Issues<BR><HR></H2><H4>3.3 Semi-empirical Methods</H4>Semi-empirical models have also been developed which are empirical but arebased on physical models and often contain parameters that relate to surfaceparameters. They offer the means of using the mosaic approach and 'empirical'model fitting but also enable surface parameters to be extracted. The methodsare called 'semi-empirical' because they generally assume atmospheric correctioncan be done and also often have forms that involve earth surface parameters.The main class of these models is that of the 'kernel' models.<BR>The following text describing the kernel approach was extracted from theMODIS-Land ATBD (Strahler et al., 1995; or at the following web site: <A HREF="http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/modistables.html">http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/modistables.html</A>).<BR><BR><B>3.3.1 Theoretical Description<BR></B><BR>Kernel-driven models for the bidirectional reflectance distribution functionof vegetated land surfaces attempt to describe the BRDF as a linear superpositionof a set of kernels that describe basic BRDF shapes, with the coefficientsor weights chosen to adapt the sum of the kernels to the given case. Typically,semiempirical kernels are based either on one of several possible approximationsto a radiative transfer scenario of light scattering in a horizontally homogeneousplant canopy (e.g., a crop canopy), or on one of several approximationsfeasible in a geometric-optical model of light scattering from a surfacecovered with vertical projections that cast shadows (e.g., a forest canopy).Deriving a kernel of this nature requires simplifying and manipulating amodel for the BRDF until it reaches the form:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image41.gif" WIDTH="66" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>in which k is a function only of view and illumination geometry, c1 andc2 are constants containing physical parameters, and R is the modeled valueof the true BRDF, <IMG SRC="symbols/rho.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">.<BR><BR>Semiempirical kernels can be of two types. First, they may contain onlygeometric terms, but no physical parameters. The complete model then islinear, and may be scaled to arbitrary scales even for mixed scenes; neglectingadjacency effects, the weights of the kernels will be linear functions ofthe areal proportions of the subpixel weights. The so-called Ross-kernels,which are approximations to the radiative transfer theory in plant canopiesof Ross (1981) described below, belong to this class, as does the so-calledRoujean geometric-optical kernel (Roujean et al., 1992). In the second case,kernels contain one or very few physical parameters and thus instead ofhaving one kernel, provide a family of kernels depending on these parameters.The geometric-optical Li-kernels (Wanner et al., 1995) belong to this type.In order to reduce them to the form given in (5), the kernel-internal parametersare fixed to a selection of a few values each. The following discussionpresents each of the kernels used in the BRDF/Albedo algorithm. For morecomplete information on the theory and derivation of the kernels, see Wanneret al. (1995).<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="brdf1.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf6.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf8.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif"WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HR></BODY></HTML>

(1992).It is based on an approximation for large LAI values:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image42.gif" WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image43.gif" WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image44.gif" WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>In the kernel, <IMG SRC="symbols/image45.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="15"ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">and <IMG SRC="symbols/image46.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">are zenith angles forillumination and view, respectively; <IMG SRC="symbols/image47.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">is the relative azimuthof illumination and view directions; and<IMG SRC="symbols/image48.gif" WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> is the phase angleof scattering, <BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image49.gif" WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">.<BR>In the constants, <I>s</I> is leaf reflectance (= leaf transmittance; <IMG SRC="symbols/image50.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the (assumed isotropic) surface reflectance of the soil or understory;<I>LAI</I> is the leaf area index; and <I>B</I> is the average of secantsof possible view and illumination zenith angles. For this formulation, aspherical leaf angle distribution is assumed.<BR><BR>The Ross-thin kernel simplifies Ross's equation based on an approximationfor small LAI values:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image51.gif" WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image52.gif" WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image53.gif" WIDTH="76" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>Although this kernel applies primarily to the case of a thin canopy ofscatterers over a uniform background, it can also be appropriate for a verydense, uniform canopy of high leaf area, since in that case the leaf layersbelow the uppermost can act like a uniform background (Strahler et al.,1995).<BR><BR>The derivation of the Roujean geometric-optical kernel is presented in theappendix to the paper of Roujean et al. (1992). The kernel may be regardedas accounting for the scattering of a random arrangement of three-dimensionalrectangular solids (&quot;bricks&quot;) with isotropic scattering surfaces.Shadows are taken as perfectly black. Mutual shadowing, in which the shadowof one object falls on another object, is not taken into account. The bricksare long with respect to their height <I>h</I> and width <I>b</I>. The kernelis:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image54.gif" WIDTH="339" HEIGHT="61" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image55.gif" WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image56.gif" WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>The Li kernels are derived from the modeling approach of Li and Strahler(1986, 1992). In this approach, the surface is taken as covered by randomly-placedprojections (e.g., tree crowns) that are taken to be spheroidal in shapeand centered randomly within a layer above the surface. The BRDF is modeledas a function of the relative areas of sunlit and shaded, crown and backgroundthat are visible from the viewing position in the hemisphere. For the Li-sparsekernel, it is assumed that shaded crown and shaded background are black,and that sunlit crown and background are equally bright. Under these circumstances,and with some further approximations in the way that view and illuminationshadows overlap, the Li-sparse kernel is:<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image57.gif" WIDTH="277" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>where <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image58.gif" WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image59.gif" WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="41" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image60.gif" WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image61.gif" WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image62.gif" WIDTH="95" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>In these expressions, <I>b </I>is the vertical radius of the spheroid;<I>r</I> is the horizontal radius of the spheroid; and <I>h</I> is the heightof the center of the spheroid. For this model,<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image63.gif" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image65.gif" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>Here, <I>C</I> is the brightness of sunlit surface, and <IMG SRC="symbols/lam1.gif"WIDTH="7" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is the count densityof spheroids (number of spheroids per unit area). <BR><BR>The Li-dense kernel differs from the Li-sparse kernel in that it accommodatesmutual shadowing. It assumes a random distribution of crown heights to maximizethe geometric-optical effect in a dense ensemble of canopies. <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image67.gif" WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image68.gif" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR><IMG SRC="symbols/image66.gif" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>These kernels are not yet linear in that they still contain two parameters,namely the ratios <I>b/r</I> and <I>h/b </I>, describing crown shape andrelative height.

Most suitably it has the form<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image69.gif" WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>which is derived from adding appropriate choices of geometric-opticalsurface-scattering and radiative-transfer volume-scattering kernels, eachmultiplied by a proportion <IMG SRC="symbols/image70.gif" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="9" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">or <IMG SRC="symbols/image71.gif" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">that weights thecontribution of each model. These proportions may be regarded as the arealproportions of land cover types exhibiting each type of scattering (neglectingmultiple scattering between the two components), or as mixing proportionsfor land cover types that display both a volume-scattering and a geometric-opticalcontribution to the BRDF. The quantities <I>kgeo</I> and <I>kvol</I> arethe respective kernels; the factors <I>fgeo</I> and <I>fvol</I> are theirrespective weights; and the term <I>fiso</I> is the isotropic contribution.Using the kernels presented above, there will be two choices for <I>kvol</I>and three for <I>kgeo</I>, providing six possible models (disregarding herethe four sets of internal parameters used for the Li kernels).

It has the form<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image73.gif" WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>Note that this is the same form as the semiempirical models discussedabove-it is comprised of a weighted superposition of functions of angles,and the weights <IMG SRC="symbols/image74.gif" WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">are the parameters of the model. As a consequence,models like the modified Walthall model can be processed along with linearsemiempirical models by the same linear inversion scheme.<BR><BR><A NAME="anchor5015771"></A><B>3.3.5 Advantages of Linear Models <BR></B><BR>Linear models have a number of advantages in the context of global dataprocessing. Linearity in BRDF models is comprehensively discussed by Lewis(in preparation) and demonstrated with the modified Walthall model. A firstadvantage is that any linear model can be inverted analytically throughmatrix inversion for the system of equations obtained by setting the derivativeof the error function to zero (see <A HREF="brdf5.htm#anchor3868792">Section3.2.1</A>). This provides direct estimates of the parameters <I>fiso, fgeo</I>and <I>fvol</I> while avoiding numerical inversion problems. <BR><BR>Second, both the directional-hemispherical and bihemispherical integralsof the BRDF (black-sky and white-sky albedos) may be precalculated for eachkernel individually. The albedo of a model then is simply the sum of thekernel albedos, weighted by <I>f</I> values. By using a look-up table, numericalintegration of the models can thus be avoided. <BR><BR>Third, linear BRDF models scale linearly in space if adjacency effects areassumed to be small. This allows for mixed pixel cases, as indicated bythe areal proportion parameter <IMG SRC="symbols/image75.gif" WIDTH="11"HEIGHT="9" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">in the model factors listedabove. This feature also allows scaling BRDF and albedo from one spatialresolution up to a coarser one, e.g., to a particular resolution neededfor a climate model. Finally, since some of the parameters driving the modelsare dependent on wavelength while others are not (e.g., structural parameters),it may be possible to extract all or some of them from multiband analysis,making assumptions about the others. <BR><BR><HR><A NAME="anchor4966489"></A><B>Table 4.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY><HR><H2>Image Brightness &amp; BRDF Workshop Issues<BR><HR></H2><H4>4. THE ISSUE OF SCALE</H4>The BRDF models mentioned above and used to develop the kernels are general'average' scene models that apply to spatially averaged data over homogeneoustarget areas. They do not model the image variance (which is also angledependent) nor do they apply to a single object in a scene. The BRDF ofa single tree is different from that of a stand of trees and the BRDF ofa stand of trees is different from that of an open soil area.<BR><BR>Scaling affects the basis for image stratification. The tree and gap structureat one scale provides different functions for a stand and bare area delineation.At a broad scale, the composite of tree and gap merges into stands and atanother stands and clearings merge in a 'woodland' category. At each level,th BRDF of the separated components will be different from each other andthe composite land cover.<BR><BR>This leads to the consideration of some issues most important in an approachto correcting high resolution images for BRDF effects. The atmospheric effectis very smooth having been 'filtered' by an MTF with a size of about 200metres in most cases. However, the BRDF is highly variable. Consider a photographwith a wide field of view and the solar hotspot near to its centre. A treenear the nadir view and a similar one near the edge will have differentbrightnesses but the difference will not be as great as the overall brighteningdue to volume and hotspot effects. In particular, there will be much moreshadow at the edges reached away from the hotspot direction and path lengthsfor volume scattering will be longer through the canopy than at the geometriccentre of the frame. The 'colour' of shadow near the edges will also beslightly darker than at the nadir but not very different. In this case,applying an overall BRDF correction function will tend to change the colourof shadows and tree crowns at the edge in a way that may be quite wrong- even though the overall area average may be 'balanced'. Obviously, whatworks at one scale may not help at another.<BR><BR>Even if an H-resolution (high resolution) approach is taken in which theBRDF of the objects is modelled (trees for example), the fact will stillbe that the image contains different geometric proportions of scene objectsand components in a way that depends on the phase angles between the sun,the target object(s) and the view. Perhaps the only perfect way to resolvethe issue is by 3D stereo modelling. This is unlikely to be cost-effectivewith video or digitised aerial photograph data.<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="brdf1.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf9.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf11.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36"ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HR></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY><HR><H2>Image Brightness &amp; BRDF Workshop Issues<BR><HR></H2><H4>5. SCOPE FOR AN EOC WORKING GROUP</H4>A Working Group is defined as described in the following (edited) excerptfrom the EOC Science Plan:<BR><BR>&quot;An EOC Working Group is the essential initial step in developing genericTasks from the applications oriented Threads and is the entry point forall approved Tasks. The results of the Working Groups form the basis forpriority setting. Working Groups identify and help rank issues and (followingprioritisation) lead to the selected focus activities of the EOC. Theseare Science Projects and/or Implementation Teams. Science Projects resolvethe scientific issues and publish results. Implementation Teams may takethe results from the Science Project and implement then (for example) assoftware or develop a technology transfer strategy. The outcomes of thescience teams will be formal scientific publications but those of the implementationteams may not be. For example, Implementation Teams may involve commercialsoftware houses working with scientists to provide products that are documented,quality controlled and work correctly.<BR><BR>The Working Groups offer an opportunity for scientists in different Divisions,the EOC and from other groups to develop collaboration and locate majorcentres of expertise and interest. The projects selected will seek the bestteams and be subject to approval in competition with other Working Groupoutcomes. The priority setting and approval process for the Science Projectsand Implementation Teams that arise from this activity will be explicitand include specific identification of deliverables and milestones. Whilethe EOC has a central location in Canberra where a critical mass of scientistswill tackle generic science issues and algorithm development, locationsof EOC project and implementation activities can also be decided by infrastructureand core staff locations and be potentially at any location with adequateresearch support among CSIRO sites. The key characteristics of EOC projectsare collocation of scientists, efficient use of resources, inter-Divisionalcollaboration, support for the goals of the EOC and a generic Earth ObservationScience focus that provides support across different applications and/orinvolves a range of tools.<BR><BR>Science Projects and Implementation Teams will be formed according to specificguide-lines and will be monitored for progress within the EOC structureand evaluated against criteria defined at the outset of the activity. Theoutcomes of an EOC Task will emphasise quality of product and excellenceof production. A primary role of and criterion for EOC activities includesmaking the findings accessible and useful to areas of CSIRO and industrynot currently exploiting Earth Observation to its fullest extent.&quot;<BR><BR>A Scene Brightness Working Group needs to consider these as guidelines anddevelop Science Project(s) and/or Implementation Team(s) to resolve issuesidentified. In particular, the WG will need to establish effective datasets to provide objective tests of the methods and allocate cases whereonly empirical models and field measurements are appropriate and those wheremeasurement models are appropriate to the teams. Standard data sets thatare needed to evaluate the alternative models must be carefully consideredas well the end uses and the means to evaluate methods against the valueof the product.<BR><BR>The best methods could be implemented in software by an implementation team.During development and testing a standard language such as IDL could beused for easy exchange. Other than such general statements as these, aninitial meeting is needed to plan actions and delineate the scopes of theWorking Group and expected times until when Project objectives are in place.<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="brdf1.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf10.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="brdf12.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif"WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HR></BODY></HTML>

A common set of software tools and best (SoS or State of Science) selections
of algorithms for processing will be established and promoted among CSIRO
and collaborating groups. The set selected will be the base sequence in
the product trials and the selections will be documented as an AMTBD (Algorithms

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>SPOT Images </TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../gifs/paper1.gif"><HR><H3>SPOT Images</H3><HR>Both HRVs can work in either panchromatic or multispectral imaging modes,singly or together. <BR>The panchromatic mode uses a single spectral band, 0.51&shyp;0.73 micron(visible light without blue), to produce black and white images resolvingfine geographic detail. <BR><BR>The multispectral mode uses three bands (green, 0.50&shyp;0.59 micron; red,0.61&shyp;0.68 micron; and near infrared, 0.79 to 0.89 micron), each withits own reflectance properties, to create coloured images. Numerous landscapefeatures can be interpreted from the composite images.<BR><BR>Images are split at the telescope's focal plane. Part of the image is sentto a line of 6000 photodetectors which emit electrical charges when struckby light. These build the panchromatic image. Each detector correspondsto 10 m pixels, giving images 60 km wide. Images are constructed line byline as the satellite moves.<BR><BR>The rest of the image goes to a dichroic beam splitter. This glass devicedirects each band to another detector strip. But these detectors receiveinsufficient light to fire, so Charged Coupled Devices generate a signalfrom two adjacent detectors, hence multispectral mode's 20 m colour resolution.<BR>SPOT encodes the images for transmission to Earth. The satellite may downloadthe image to a Direct Receiving Station in real time if within range, otherwisethe image is recorded and downloaded later. <BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="697c.gif" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="234" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR>SPOT can observe the same zone from different angles over a number of orbits.<BR><HR></CENTER><P>Images of large areas may be built up over several passes.<BR><BR>Captured images must be preprocessed: corrected for perspective and atmosphericdistortion. Images at various levels of preprocessing are available forpurchase. Higher levels provide precise geometric alignment with groundcheckpoints and existing maps, in addition to the corrections for viewingangle, reflectance characteristics and detector sensitivity offered at lowerlevels.<BR><BR>SPOT''s sideways viewing allows capture of images of the same site takenfrom different angles, using parallax to create stereopairs. These are usedfor stereoplotting, topographic mapping, and automatic stereocorrelation,from which Digital Elevation Models (3D computer landscape images) can bederived.<BR><BR>Processed images, typically 30&shyp;100 Mb, are available on CD ROM, magnetictape or printed form.<BR><BR><HR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="697a.gif" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="263" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR>These diagrams show the types of observation possible using SPOT's two HighResolution Visual (HRV) scanners.<HR></CENTER><P><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="697b.gif" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="353" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P><HR><A HREF="spin691.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/contents.gif" WIDTH="150"HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

<H4><A NAME="biodiversity">A View Of Biodiversity </A></H4>

<P>
Biodiversity is a relatively modern word; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Biodiversity Unit (1993)</A>.
Within the research community, it can assume one or more meanings
depending on the spatial scale involved.
<P>
However, for the general public, biodiversity has come to assume
a focus, a banner, for political action. Biodiversity is replacing
the older watchwords of conservation, preservation, environment,
and natural heritage that gave meaning to widespread concern over
the consequences of our way of life.
<P>
The cumulative consequences of our national economic activities
and value systems have resulted in widespread decline in the abundance
and range of many organisms, with the extinction of a smaller
but appreciable number of species that were present two centuries
ago; eg Saunders et al (in preparation), <A HREF="refs.htm">Short and Smith (1994)</A>.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0152_038.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0152_038.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
Biodiversity is valued by Australian society for many reasons.
The three reasons most often cited are that biodiversity provides
a sense of unique national identity, place and responsibility;
it offers significant potential economic benefits if exploited
in a sustainable way; and, irrespective of its value to society,
it has an intrinsic right to exist; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Biodiversity Unit (1993)</A>.
<P>
We offer no judgement on any of these three viewpoints other than
to summarise that for contemporary Australian society, biodiversity
is perceived to be a significant component of the individual and
collective quality of life. Biodiversity matters to us; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Cocks (1992)</A>.
<P>
As public and scientific interest in biodiversity has grown, so
also have the number of definitions and descriptions. We do not
intend to add to these but rather to link two emphases that characterise
the perspective of biodiversity that underpinned this project.
<P>
The first emphasis was that biodiversity includes all species:
plants and animals, both common and rare. This emphasis was a
necessary alternative to the more restricted and unfortunately
common view that biodiversity is only about rare animals, and
that plants are just habitat for fauna.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0508_044.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0508_044.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>Every organism captured in this image is a component of Australia's
biodiversity - not just the bird in centre frame.</I><HR>

<P>
The second emphasis was on the direction and rate of change in
the size of the species pool. This was the operational theme and
principal focus of this project; not on inventory and not on determining
the biodiversity complement. Furthermore, it is the consensus
view that the predominant direction of that change, however poorly
quantified, is negative. That is, we currently preside over a
situation of general loss of biodiversity, with the rates of loss
ranging from very slight to rapid depending on circumstance; eg
<A HREF="refs.htm">Moritz and Kikkawa (1994), Saunders, Hopkins, and How (1990)</A>.
This situation is not unique to Australia; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Hannah et al (1994, 1995)</A>.
<P>
To stress the emphasis on rate of change of biodiversity away
from biodiversity itself, we use the terms biotic impoverishment
or biotic erosion to capture the process of species diminution
and extinction.
<P>
Biotic erosion is evocative as both a metaphor and an analogue
because species extinction was often unspectacular and delayed
in time but nonetheless relentless and irreversible; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Bridgewater (1994), Recher (1994), Recher and Lim (1992)</A>.
An emphasis on biotic erosion was operational because it is now
public policy to manage the loss of biodiversity by detecting
it, and where possible, preventing, slowing or and reversing that
decline. <HR>

<H3>A View Of Landcover </H3>
<HR>

<P>
Landcover is a convenient term for the combination of vegetation
(or snow or water) and soils within a topographic context. It
is a way of thinking about vegetation and soils on very broad
landscape scales.
<P>
The use of the term landcover implies the spatial scales of landscapes
and regions, ie areas of tens to hundreds of square kilometres.
It is very different from the human-scaled experience of vegetation
patches that can be measured in tens to hundreds of square metres.
The domain of this project was the entire continent, 7, 692, 000
km2. Therefore, equivalently large sample sizes were used to characterise
landcover and its disturbance status. Most figures quoted in this
report are in thousands of square kilometres: we focus on the
overall view.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0145_083.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0145_083.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
Using the above definition, landcover plus fauna represents the
total biodiversity complement, or the terrestrial component of
the global biosphere. Because vegetation is the largest and most
obvious (above ground) component of the biodiversity complement
of any landscape, it is far easier to detect, quantify and interpret
changes in vegetation than it is for fauna.
<P>
Therefore, given robust relationships between vegetation, soil
and fauna, changes in vegetation were used to infer changes in
the other two. The remainder of this section pursues the consequences
of this proposition: what are the relationships between landcover
and fauna, and how can landcover be used to stratify the continent?
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0511_044.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0511_044.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>A landscape view of three possible landcover changes. The undisturbed
landscape (background) is progressively modified by vegetation
change (midground), and then by soil change (foreground).</I>
<HR>

<P>
The concepts of habitat and ecosystem are central to modern ecological
theory and conservation management practice. However, they are
concepts, and thus abstractions. An ecosystem can be all the rainforests
of North Queensland or just a single decaying leaf. The term ecosystem
becomes tangible only when it is spatially defined. For example,
it is equally legitimate to define and discuss the spinifex ecosystem
of Central Australia that extends over millions of square kilometres
as it is to focus on just the mangroves of Moreton Bay. Ecosystems
have no implicit spatial scales; they are explicitly and externally
defined.
<P>
Habitat is a similarly ill-defined and ill-used word, especially
between scientific disciplines. To animal ecologists, plants are
habitat. Conversely plant ecologists routinely ignore animals
as part of a plant's habitat; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Bell et al (1991)</A>.
In this project, habitat was simply taken to be a particular landcover
type with the co-location and implied interaction of plants and
animals over landscape scales; ie over areas of size 10-100 km2.
<P>
Thus, we have made habitat and ecosystems tangible by equating
them to landcover at landscape scales. At the level of generalisation
used in this study, a particular landcover type and its associated
fauna was equated to an ecosystem. Similarly, the type and condition
of one particular landcover was equated to a habitat. We recognise
that this equivalence requires quantitative biological understanding
over landscape scales that is currently absent; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Pressey and Logan (1994)</A>.
Therefore, we have continued with qualitative relations alone.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0508_034.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0508_034.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>An agricultural landcover type captured at landscape scale.
This is a widespread (eco)system in southern Australia and contains
the habitats of a diverse range of native and exotic species.
The total area visible in this scene represents but a few sample
points in a continental survey.</I><HR>

<P>
How then to progress with a continental overview?
<P>
We proceed on the basis of this qualitative argument.
<P>
Given that we have made the abstraction of biodiversity tangible
and operational by focusing on its loss, biotic erosion, rather
than the absolute, and made habitat tangible by equating it to
landcover types at landscape scales, it follows then that disturbed
landcover represents a change in habitat structure, composition
and function, and thus in habitat suitability.
<P>
Detrimental change in habitat suitability, ie a deleterious change
in structure, composition and functioning, will result, over time,
in the decline of species abundance and richness, or ultimately
in local or global extinction; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Recher (1994)</A>.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0149_076.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0149_076.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
Three qualifications to this argument are necessary. The first
is that disturbance as used here is restricted to that which is
anthropogenic; ie that imposed on the natural or background disturbance
of climate (wet or dry periods) or weather events (wildfire, storm)
and is traceable to human action collectively called landuse.
Landcover can be disturbed by landuse to result in one or more
of three conditions: fragmentation, replacement, and by invasion
by feral plants and animals. These are the only disturbance consequences
considered in this project.
<P>
The second qualification is the presumption that all disturbance
will result in a decline in species abundance and distribution.
We assert that generally this was the result but note that there
are examples where landcover disturbance has resulted in a local
increase in population size of a few species; eg the increase
in abundance of the red kangaroo with the establishment of pastoralism
in the arid areas of the continent.
<P>
The last qualification is an important reiteration: the relationship
between landcover disturbance and biotic erosion is completely
qualitative. It must remain so because the quantitative alternative
- how much disturbance results in how much loss of biodiversity
- is currently lacking. Robust relationships that have any generality
are likely to take decades to establish and to wait for this is,
in our opinion, both hazardous and unnecessary.
<P>
It is hazardous because what is already known about the extent
and rate of biotic erosion is far from encouraging; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Noble et al (in preparation), Saunders et al (in preparation)</A>.
It is unnecessary because advances to our understanding can be
made based on what is known, now.
<P>
We hold that a substantial improvement in the national assessment
of the extent and severity of biotic erosion can be achieved immediately
by an assessment of landcover disturbance combined with an integration
and modelling of existing datasets. This was the pragmatic vision
that motivated the establishment and conduct of this project.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/kangaroo.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/kangaroo.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The ecology of this one species, the red kangaroo, the most
abundant large mammal in the world, has been the subject of a
substantial research effort spanning some thirty years. The results
of that effort now underpin the conservative management of this
species across the continent even though there is a great deal
we do not yet know about its population ecology. Compared with
the red kangaroo, understanding of the remaining biodiversity
complement is essentially non-existent. Nevertheless, this should
not be a paralysing realisation. Perfect understanding is a desirable
prerequisite for management; not necessarily a critical one. We
can learn as much by doing as we can by studying. Management of
the problem of biotic erosion is required now. Attempts must be
made now.</I> <HR>

<H3>The View From Space </H3>
<HR>

<P>
To generate a national assessment of landcover disturbance required
a dataset that was contemporary (1990s), a census sample (100%),
of workable spatial resolution, geocoded, digital, and usable
within the resource constraints of time, personnel and funding.
Such requirements dictated the use of space data: specifically,
digital image data from the multispectral scanner (MSS) instrument
carried by the Landsat satellite series.
<P>
Besides satisfying these requirements, the view from space was
the only view to satisfy the above constraints. It has significant
additional appeal because it is a view that can be readily shared.
Satellite data in image format is an attractive and engaging method
of communication. Images were used where possible within this
document.
<P>
Significantly, the view from space is a powerful view. It is powerful
because it is both synoptic and fine grained. The original source
dataset resolved the entire continental landcover to the level
of 0.001 x 0.001&#176;, approximately 100 x 100 m or one hectare
in area. Unfortunately, with that resolution the data volume became
intractable so a coarser, defocused view, twenty-five times larger
in area (0.005 x 0.005&#176;, 500 x 500 m), was used for most
of the analyses.
<P>
This, and most other details of the methods used in digitally
processing the Landsat MSS are critical to the interpretation
and credibility of the results reported here. The nature and size
of errors detected during data processing and their influences
on the results are discussed next.<HR>

<H3>Dividing Up The Continent </H3>
<HR>

<P>
A moment's reflection on the nature and distribution of landcover
and its potential disturbance across the continent will result
in the simple conclusion that not all disturbance factors are
everywhere equally important. The most intensive landuses are
located in the south of the continent: those in the centre and
north of the continent are extensive rather than intensive.
<P>
Therefore, to achieve the greatest sensitivity in assessment,
it was necessary to stratify the continent into regions based
on the importance of one or more disturbance factors. Then, based
on this stratification, the quantification stage using satellite
image data can be customised to maximise the detection of the
landcover disturbance characteristic of that particular landuse
type.<HR>

<H4>Landuse Zones - Intensive And Extensive </H4>

<P>
The most severe and extensive disturbance to landcover has been,
and remains that provided by landuse: the direct result of human
activities.
<P>
By comparison, the perturbations generated by climate and weather
are either so gradual to be imperceptible even over centuries
(climate), or rapid but very localised in occurrence (weather
- storms, etc.). In contrast, the agents of ancient and modern
landuse, fire and mechanical or chemical clearing, are far more
influential.
<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1865_068.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1865_068.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
There seems little doubt that Aboriginal Australians significantly
disturbed the landcover (and the fauna) of the continent through
their use of fire throughout the millennia of their occupation
of this continent. They shaped the face of much of Australia in
a way that was separable from the very large climatic changes
of the last 30, 000 years; see <A HREF="refs.htm">Pyne (1991)</A>.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0511_058.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0511_058.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The landcover consequences of an early Dry Season burn in a
northern Australian savanna. Fire is a landuse tool with poorly
understood long-term consequences for biodiversity; millennia
of its application by Aboriginal Australians notwithstanding.</I>
<HR>

<P>
There is no doubt that in the last two centuries European Australians
have also changed the landcover of the continent, both extensively
and substantially through agricultural and pastoral landuse. Therefore,
we primarily stratified the continent by landuse. Because we were
interested only in the landcover consequences of landuse, we used
a simple two-level stratification.
<P>
The first and most important decision was which landcover consequence
of landuse is the most significant disturbance for biotic erosion?
That we took to be habitat destruction by the clearing of natural
vegetation and its replacement by crops and pastures; eg see reviews
by <A HREF="refs.htm">Caughley (1994), Noble et al (in preparation), Saunders et al (in preparation)</A>.
<P>
As a consequence, the principal stratification of the continent
was based on the location of clearing; where clearing of native
vegetation for replacement with (exotic) crops, pasture and forest
vegetation has been and remains the principal disturbance. Within
this area of the continent, the impact of landuse on landcover
is principally one of replacement. The consequences for the biodiversity
that was originally characteristic of the native vegetation are
obvious and severe.
<P>
Much, but certainly not all, of the biotic erosion of the last
two centuries was concentrated in the areas of replacement landuse.
It follows then that the continued expansion of this landuse offers
the largest threat of accelerating biotic erosion; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Saunders et al (1994); Hobbs and Saunders (1994)</A>.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0511_048.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0511_048.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>Urbanisation and mining, like agriculture, are also replacement
landuse types. On a continental scale, the direct landuse consequences
of mining are trivial and not considered in this study. While
urbanisation is perhaps a hundred-fold more extensive than mining,
its direct landcover consequences are also not significant on
a continental scale. However, the indirect influence of urbanisation
on landcover change is substantial. Urban populations are growing
and need to be fed and clothed. Urban political values concerning
the conservation of biodiversity are also changing.</I><HR>

<P>
The dividing lines between the areas of the continent where landcover
clearing was the most significant disturbance factor were drawn
after searching the satellite image data by eye. Expert interpretation,
rather than machine decision, was used because in the detection
of the irregular and diffuse boundaries of clearing, the former
cannot yet be matched by the latter.
<P>
The boundary was finalised by allowing a generous geographic margin
beyond the edge of the clearing, approximately 100 km, and aligning
it with the national grid of the 1:250,000 scale topographic map
sheet series. Using this criterion, the continent was divided
roughly into one third and two thirds as in <A HREF="#table1">Table 1</A>.

<P>
We emphasise that this division was not based on the area actually
cleared for agriculture. Rather it was based on the threat of
clearing, both actual and potential. Therefore, we have not used
the obvious names of cleared and uncleared for fear of generating
misunderstanding.
<P>
Rather, we have coined the names Extensive Landuse Zone (ELZ)
for the central core of the continent and Intensive Landuse Zone
(ILZ) for the remaining coastal strips. As defined and illustrated
above, the Intensive Landuse Zone is approximately 39% (2, 984,
000 km2) of the continent and contains perhaps more than 90% of
the national population. In contrast, the Extensive Landuse Zone
is almost twice as large, 4, 708, 000 km2 in size (61%) but carries
as little as 5% of the national population.
<P>
Not all the ELZ is used on a permanent basis. Within this area
of the continent, the most common landuse is extensive pastoralism
that in terms of landcover consequences is a harvesting landuse.
Like forestry based on native forests and woodlands, it is notionally
sustainable where the offtake is small and irregularly patterned
in time and space. Nonetheless, most surveys of the impact of
extensive pastoralism, past and present, show that considerable
landcover change has occurred and because of it, or at least in
synergy with the arrival of domestic stock and establishment of
feral animals initially released in the ILZ, substantial biotic
erosion has occurred also; <A HREF="refs.htm">James et al (In Press), Newsome (1994), Pickard (1994)</A>.

Besides extensive pastoralism, there are two other landuses within
the Extensive Landuse Zone; Traditional Use and Unused.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1864_024.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1864_024.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
These are Aboriginal Australians on Aboriginal land. They are
Traditional Owners but this is not Traditional Landuse.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1865_033.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1865_033.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
Unused land, or unallocated crown land, most of it in Western
Australia, is not completely without the impact of human activity
but here it is patchy and episodic.<HR>

<P>
For the landuses of Traditional and Unused, it was difficult,
for understandable reasons, to assess the level of landcover disturbance
using satellite data. The partitioning and distribution of finer
divisions of landuse within the Intensive and Extensive Landuse
Zones is discussed in <A HREF="chap2c.htm">Adding What Is Known</A>.

<P>
A second and independent stratification of the continent was needed
by which to aggregate the detected landcover disturbance.
<P>
The type of stratification chosen was largely determined by the
purpose and scale of the analysis. Possible choices for the basic
area unit (strata) could be the (relatively) small area of a farm
or a local government area (LGA), or the much larger area of a
state, if the purpose of the analysis was landcover management
responsibility. However, in this study the principal focus is
biodiversity.
<P>
Therefore, an ecologically relevant stratification has been used.
As argued earlier, with a continental perspective, issues of scale
and ecological understanding decide that the most relevant stratification
was by landcover types; ie a typology based on vegetation and
soil attributes.
<P>
The task of deriving a tractable set of consistently defined,
landcover types was difficult. Considerable effort was made to
evaluate a wide range of alternatives. The final choice was based
on two simple and pragmatic reasons. Because the objective of
the project was to quantify landcover disturbance, the basic stratification
should be on landcover attributes; ie vegetation and soil variables.

<P>
Continental datasets of vegetation structural type exist, eg <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>,
as does one for soils, <A HREF="refs.htm">Northcote et al (1975)</A>.
Because attempts to reconcile and integrate these two datasets
were unsuccessful, the dataset of Natural Vegetation, <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>,
became the source typology for landcover.
<P>
It was assumed that considerable climate, soil and topographic
information was implicit in this continentally consistent mapping
of vegetation at landscape scales. Use of this dataset was not
without difficulty and error. Nonetheless, the dataset Natural
Vegetation, the vegetation as of 1788, was taken to be the basic
ecological divisions of the continent.
<P>
Two conditions on the use of the Natural Vegetation dataset were
noted. The first was that it was taken to be the truth: the boundaries
and descriptions of its 230 categories were not disputed even
though they occasionally appeared to be doubtful. The second was
that the large number of primary categories of Natural Vegetation
was reduced to a smaller set (34) by concentrating on overstorey
structural and floristic attributes (height, cover, genus), and
ignoring the understorey. Pragmatic reasons required that all
overstorey genera other than Eucalyptus and Acacia be pooled,
and within these three genera, the tall (T), medium (M), and low
(L) height categories also be pooled; <B>Table 2</B>. The nomenclature
was derived from that used in <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>.

<H3>Quantifying The Disturbance. </H3>
<HR>

<P>
Space data was the only data type that met the requirements for
conducting this assessment within the resources available; as
argued earlier in <A HREF="chap1d.htm">The View From Space </A>.
<P>
A commercially available, geocoded digital mosaic of Landsat MSS
data for the entire continent formed the primary dataset for quantifying
the location, severity and extent of landcover disturbance. The
strategy and associated methodology are now described.
<P>
The principal dimensions of this dataset were two - spectral and
spatial. There was no temporal dimension. This dataset was taken
as a time slice of the continental landcover conditions as of
approximately 1991. No change detection was applied to images
of different dates. The only time dimension in this analysis was
an implied one: all (significant) change detected using the 1991
dataset was assumed to have occurred in the last 200 years. Exactly
when this change occurred cannot be directly inferred from this
satellite dataset alone.
<P>
The project set out to answer one question - what is the current
state of the continental landcover?
<P>
This we hold, makes a small but significant contribution to a
national understanding of the severity and location of biotic
erosion. Another significant contribution will come from quantifying
the dynamics of landcover change; the rate and location of habitat
disturbance across the continent. There are limits to this second
question. The high spatial and temporal resolution of landcover
change is only possible using satellite data since 1972; eg see
<A HREF="refs.htm">Graetz et al (1992), Sivertsen (1994), Wilson et al (1993)</A>.
The rates of clearing can be determined further into the past
using archived aerial photography and surveyor's maps; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Hobbs et al (1993)</A>.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0149_007.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0149_007.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The spatial dimension of this dataset was determined by its resolution;
ie by the size of the ultimate unit of data capture and representation,
or pixel. The pixel size of the supplied dataset was 0.001 x 0.001&#176;,
or approximately 1 hectare. Thus the continental aggregate represented
a very large data volume to process. What is more important, this
fine spatial resolution was far, far greater than that of the
Natural Vegetation dataset. The latter was published at a scale
of 1:5,000,000 and appears to have an intrinsic resolution of,
at best, 1 km2, or more realistically 25 km2. Thus, this basic
dataset was 2500 times more coarse than the Landsat source dataset.
Therefore, the Landsat MSS dataset was resampled to 0.005 x 0.005&#176;
(&#152;500 x 500 m or 25 ha) for the analysis and further resampled
to exactly 1 x 1 km for reporting.
<P>
The de-focusing of the satellite dataset may, at a superficial
glance, seem to reduce the acceptance of the findings. Hectare-sized
patches of landscape are human-scaled and easily experienced.
An area twenty-five times larger is less easily imagined in the
mind's eye, and therefore commands less validity. Nonetheless,
the use of coarse (25 ha) rather than a finer-grained (1 ha) pixel
size introduces insignificant error in the overall assessment.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="reptill/brisbane.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/brisbane.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The 1: 1, 000, 000 scale map sheet BRISBANE covering the city
of Brisbane, the nearby coast and inland; total area approximately
120, 000 km2. Even with a pixel size of 25 ha, there is an abundance
of detail in the image. Fine details of the dunes and sand blowouts
on Fraser Island are detectable, as are subtle and obvious patterns
within the landscape as a whole. Overall, a visual appreciation
of the extent of clearing and fragmentation of the original vegetation
is easily obtained. If you can do this, then you have instinctively
learned to assimilate both the spectral (colour) and spatial (grain)
dimensions of satellite images. The computer techniques used in
this project imitate the analysis and assessment that you have
just made. </I><HR>

<P>
The final dimension of the satellite dataset - the spectral dimension
- was the most critical because it determines what information
can be derived. MSS data has four spectral channels, traditionally
labelled from #4 to #7, each giving four values for the reflected
light from each pixel regardless of its size. For most landcover
types, these four wavebands are highly correlated and can be reduced
to two: a measure of cover and of greenness. Cover includes both
the cover of dark foliage over the brighter soils and the shadows
within a canopy. Greenness is a measure of the abundance of young
and vigorous leaves within the canopy, be they trees, shrubs or
the herbaceous understorey.
<P>
Under dry conditions, ie with no preceding rainfall, the cover
of live vegetation is linearly but inversely related to the brightness
of one channel, the reflected red radiation recorded as MSS #5.
In this waveband, the intact woody canopy is dark whereas that
of the replacement crop, pasture, or even bare soil, is bright.
In addition, for the interpreter digitally interacting with this
image, there are both spectral and spatial clues to what is cleared,
and what is uncleared woody vegetation. It is remarkably easy
for a human to correctly interpret a complex image. It is considerably
more difficult to achieve the same result using a computer. The
concepts discussed above are illustrated using an image of the
Armidale area of eastern Australia.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="reptill/armidale.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/armidale.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The 1: 1, 000, 000 scale map sheet ARMIDALE; total area approximately
120, 000 km2. Setting aside the unnatural or false colours of
the image, just using the clues of tone (light to dark) and the
spatial pattern or texture within the image makes a rapid interpretation
of what is undisturbed natural vegetation, and what has been cleared
for pastures and crops. Much of the remnant natural vegetation
is restricted to areas of significant topographic relief: here
in the ILZ, relief is the most frequent protection against future
clearing. The intensity of the red colour indicates the level
of greenness in the landcover. In this scene, both remnant natural
vegetation and some of the pastures were green on the ground and
were thus portrayed as red in this image. The several smoke plumes
and their location indicate the continuing nature of landcover
disturbance.</I><HR>

<H4>Clearing </H4>

<P>
All spectral channels of the satellite dataset were used to understand
and interpret the images for all vegetation types. For the Intensive
Landuse Zone, the objective of the assessment was to allocate
each pixel into one of five disturbance classes; uncleared, thinned,
cleared, indeterminate, and other.
<P>
The uncleared class was characterised by having an intact canopy;
this being determined relative to all the remnants of any landcover
type. The uncleared class may be disturbed by grazing but within
the ILZ, this was disturbance that could not be separated from
clearing.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0508_016.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0508_016.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
For the landcover types with an open and sparse canopy, ie projected
foliage cover (pfc) &lt; 30%, it was difficult to separate clearing,
the loss of the overstorey, from the effects of acute overgrazing,
the loss of the understorey. This difficulty was one of the two
principal sources of error; see below.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0152_032.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0152_032.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The cleared class was characterised by the effective replacement
of the canopy with a herbaceous layer of crop or pasture plants.
Here the overstorey cover was assessed to be reduced to &lt; 5%;
ie scattered or no trees. The thinned class was determined to
be an intermediate class of tree cover between uncleared and cleared.
It was included to increase understanding of the severity of clearing.
It is our contention that, in terms of biotic erosion, thinned
and cleared are effectively equivalent.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0149_016.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0149_016.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The indeterminate class was assigned by the analyst to two situations.
The most common was where an allocation to clearing was not ecologically
meaningful; eg for a naturally occurring grassland. More rarely,
it was used to indicate that isolated clearing could be detected
by the interpreter but not consistently detected by computer analysis.
This occurred principally in the Northern Territory where what
little clearing has occurred was scattered within a very seasonally
dynamic landscape. The other class was reserved for lakes mapped
within the Natural Vegetation dataset.
<P>
Overall the procedure was straightforward. The allocation decision
rules were based on the expert judgement of the analyst (Graetz)
after intensive examination of the satellite data in digital format.
Decisions were made only after a visual reconnaissance of the
scene and a consultation of ancillary data (maps, etc.).
<P>
After prolonged exploration of the image data for any one vegetation
type, the analyst selected MSS #5 values that separated uncleared
from thinned, and thinned from cleared. Those values and this
channel alone were used to allocate each pixel into one of these
three disturbance classes. Since the Landsat MSS #5 data were
continuous in nature with no obvious thresholds, the choice of
MSS #5 values varied by landcover type and by climatic region.
Thus expert judgement was critical in assigning values to classes.
The allocation process was then computerised.
<P>
We reiterate the point that even at the finest spatial resolution
of 0.001 x 0.001&#176;, a pixel contains a mixture of landscape
elements - tree canopies, shadows, understorey and so forth. This
was particularly so with the pixel size used here, 0.005 x 0.005&#176;,
where the full spectra of mixtures of overstorey and understorey
are possible. The category thinned was created to capture the
most uncleared part of this spectrum where the canopy was approximately
half that of the uncleared state. The category of cleared will
also comprise spectrum mixtures from totally treeless to sparse
scattered trees. The broad classification was adequate for the
focus of this project; ie quantifying that area of landcover that
was uncleared.
<P>
Because of the nature of the number of decision classes and artefacts
within the MSS dataset, there are uncertainties associated with
the assessment values derived. These errors are most usefully
discussed in relation to the uncleared category as being either
errors of commission, where the true value for the uncleared category
is inflated, or omission, where actual value for this category
is diminished. Both error types were unavoidably included in the
analyses reported here.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1863_028.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1863_028.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
A large and consistently occurring error of commission results
from the cleared grassy landscapes often being green and actively
growing at the time of image acquisition. This tends to darken
them towards the signature of cleared woody canopies with the
result that a proportion of the cleared class was allocated to
uncleared. One example of this error of commission is in Armidale
image where green actively growing pasture (reddish in colour)
occurs in a N-S strip just to the west of the Great Dividing Range.
This landcover is obviously non-woody canopy, being quite distinct
to the eye from the neighbouring forested upland remnants. Nonetheless,
it was impossible to set decision rules that consistently separated
this green pasture from the surrounding forest remnants because
those to the east were also green and actively growing (reddish
in colour) while those remnants to the west were not.
<P>
This source of uncertainty was inherent in the dataset and intensive
and systematic efforts to remove it failed. Moreover, careful
selection of decision rules to minimise this error lead to the
converse omission error in the drier, less dense canopies. Overall,
a strategy was followed to minimise the size of the error and
to stabilise its sign; ie consistently to one of commission or
omission. The decision rules for the uncleared category were always
set not only to achieve the smallest uncertainty possible in the
situation, but also to keep the error consistently one of commission.
Furthermore, the emphasis was on getting the values correct for
the more mesic landcover types, the forests and woodlands. This
strategy was hampered by significant variation within the dataset
that was not related to the surface. The net result was that there
were both errors of commission and omission in the results reported
here. The difficulty is illustrated by the Albany image. <HR>

<P>
<A HREF="reptill/albany.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/albany.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The south-west of Western Australia. This area experiences
both high rainfall and cloud cover almost all the year. As a consequence,
the cleared areas of crops and pastures, are usually green. Under
these conditions, it was far more difficult to separate uncleared
from cleared for landcovers near the coast than it was in the
drier inland. Significant errors of commission and omission were
possible with small changes in the decision rules set for this
scene that is a spectacular example of loss and fragmentation
of natural vegetation.</I><HR>

<H4>Grazing And Burning </H4>

<P>
The objective for the Extensive Landuse Zone of the continent
was to use satellite data to allocate part or whole of each vegetation
type to one of the following disturbance categories: slight, substantial,
significant, indeterminate, and other.
<P>
The allocation was to reflect the contemporary level of disturbance
imposed by the two principal agents of landuse; grazing by domestic
stock, and to a much smaller extent, repeated burning. The impact
of grazing is by far the most influential in generating both systemic
and cumulative landcover changes.
<P>
The temporary and cumulative impacts of grazing on the landcover
can be detected and interpreted using satellite data for most
vegetation types. Similarly, even though the dataset used was
uni-temporal, some appreciation of the nature of the fire regimes
can be interpreted, but this was far less certain than that for
grazing.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1865_076.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1865_076.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The critical difference between the assessment of grazing and
burning, and that for clearing, was that the former cannot be
implemented by computer. The assessment of the disturbance level
can only be based on expert decision and opinion; a decision that
was reached only after detailed interpretation of the spectral
and spatial patterns within the image, and the integration of
ancillary data.
<P>
The subjective component of this assessment was thus higher than
that involved in the assessment of clearing. To maintain a high
level of transparency, the source document contains example images
that explain and support the decision taken for each vegetation
type. <HR>

<P>
The nature of the evidence and its interpretation is exemplified
by the Rawlinna image.
<P>
<A HREF="reptill/rawlinna.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/rawlinna.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The Nullarbor Plain near Rawlinna, Western Australia, pastorally
occupied and a part of the ELZ. The predominant landcover type
is a low open chenopod shrubland - bluebush and saltbush country
- with sparse mulga inland. The landcover consequences of pastoralism
are quite obvious from 900 km in space and with a coarse ground
resolution of 25 ha. The landcover change within whole paddocks
and around watering points can easily be detected and assessed
by eye. The level of disturbance here ranges from substantial
to significant. However, when this relatively small area of this
landcover type was considered along with the all the others not
within this scene, the disturbance level was assessed overall
as substantial.</I><HR>

<P>
Where natural grasslands (xG) were designated by the Natural Vegetation
dataset within the ILZ, they were allocated to the indeterminate
class for the clearing assessment and manually interpreted for
the ELZ.
<P>
Finally, there is no category for undisturbed. There is no vegetation
type that was absolutely undisturbed by the direct (landuse) or
indirect (feral animal) effects of human activity. Therefore we
used a relative scale: by definition landcover types that were
designated unused or protected by tenure were used as benchmarks
for the assessment and were always set to disturbance category
1, slight.
<P>
Furthermore, the disturbance rating that was finally assigned
took into account local variations in disturbance level, such
as shown in the <B>Rawlinna image </B>above, as well as the condition
of the landcover type that occurred within the ILZ but was not
actually cleared.<HR>

<H4>Doing It Yourself </H4>

<P>
At this point, the reader may be less than convinced that all
of this interpretation and assessment of landcover disturbance
is possible using satellite data.
<P>
It is not easy to illustrate this without drowning the argument
with images. Therefore we have included a set of images covering
the continent in a section called <A HREF="ausindex.htm">Exploring Your Country</A>.
Each image covers one sheet of the excellent 1:1, 000, 000 map
sheet series and are named accordingly. We recommend that you
explore your country using each of these images (5&#176; x 6&#176;
in size) and try to interpret the type and level of landcover
disturbance that you can detect.
<P>
For the ILZ, the interesting areas are in the south-western corner
of Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. For the
ELZ, the interesting areas are South Australia, the Northern Territory,
Queensland and Western Australia.
<P>
If you have a particular interest in the state of the national
forests, then examine New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.

<H3>Adding What Is Known </H3>
<HR>

<P>
To reiterate a critical point made earlier: the MSS dataset was
the primary source for detecting landcover disturbance. However,
ancillary datasets were equally important in the interpretation,
quantification, and enhancement of that disturbance assessment.
In this section, these ancillary datasets are listed and discussed
in order of importance.
<H4>Tenure </H4>

<P>
Tenure is a key factor in any assessment of landuse and landcover
because tenure is a licence that prescribes or proscribes various
landuses, and thus various types of landcover disturbance. Moreover,
the tenure type is a strong guide to future landuse and landcover
change. For example, there is far more certainty about the future
landuse activities on land held under public tenure than that
for private tenure. Thus, tenure can indicate actual and potential
landuse as well as its consequences for landcover disturbance.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1864_020.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1864_020.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<P>
The basic dataset used was that compiled by AUSLIG (1994). This
digital dataset contains an initial 16 categories that were aggregated
into a smaller set of 6 to indicate the probability of future
landcover disturbance by grouping by differing levels of tenure
protection.
<P>
The protection is principally against the threat of clearing but
also includes grazing. We created classes of tenure protection
that range from 0 with freehold tenure to 5 with existing dedicated
conservation reserve tenure; Table 4 and the Tenure image. This
assigned rank was used to rate and score the tenure protection
for each landcover type.<HR>

<H4>Feral Animals </H4>

<P>
After landuse-driven landcover disturbance, the next most significant
contributor to the process of biotic erosion is habitat invasion
by feral (exotic) animals; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Newsome (1994), Short and Smith (1994), Short and Turner (1994)</A>.
<P>
By comparison, the significance of habitat invasion by feral plants
is much less well understood or documented on a continental scale;
eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Humphries et al (1994)</A>. Thus, exotic
plants were not included in this project.
<P>
It is difficult to overestimate the significance of the impact
of feral animals on the flora and fauna of this continent. Much
has been made of the relentless influence two predators, the feral
cat and fox, on the small-sized fauna, particularly in the ELZ.
However, the rabbit cannot be ignored in the overall assessment
of the driving forces of animal extinction. Its arrival and establishment
in the more arid parts of the ELZ led to the destruction of entire
landscapes as captured in this image of the Strzelecki Track in
South Australia.<HR>

<P>
Continental datasets of density distribution for a range of pest
mammals have been compiled; <A HREF="refs.htm">Wilson et al (1992)</A>.
From this larger set, four were selected as being the most influential
in the process of biotic impoverishment on continental scales;
the rabbit, cat, fox and pig. Other feral species (camel, goat,
horse) are not as widespread or as influential as the chosen species.
<P>
The feral density datasets are of relative rather than absolute,
and overall their quality is relatively poor. Nevertheless, they
are unique and were used to assess the spatial patterns of intensity
of each feral species' current threat to biodiversity. <HR>

<P>
These two datasets were used to express their influence on the
process of biotic erosion. In doing so we question the conventional
wisdom: not that fire has always been a part of the environment
of all biota on this continent, but whether the fire regimes which
we see today differ significantly from pre-European times. While
wildfires occur from lightning ignition, particularly in the hummock
grasslands of Central and Western Australia, and are constrained
by climatically controlled fuel production and curing, we assert
that the predominant source of ignition is increasingly from landuse;
that is deliberate ignition.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1864_025.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1864_025.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>

<P>
The ancillary datasets discussed above were used at 0.01 x 0.01&#176;
(approximately 1 x 1 km) resolution; a much finer scale than at
which any of them were compiled. This is not as serious a problem
as is the veracity of the data itself. Nevertheless, these data
represent the best continentally consistent sets available and
they were used to derive the best continentally consistent assessments
of landcover disturbance possible now. <HR>

<H3>Clearing </H3>
<HR>

<P>
This type of landcover disturbance defines the ILZ. We summarise
our findings for the continent under the following four headings
<P>
Aggregate Area
<P>
Within the ILZ, we assessed that 1,547,863 km2, or 51.9% of the
area was either cleared or thinned.
<P>
This in turn translates to approximately 20% of the whole continent.

<HR>

<P>
How good is this estimate?
<P>
There is no single dataset to test the validity of this estimate.
There were however two national estimates that allow us to examine
its plausibility.
<P>
The first of these is the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
estimates for the total area of crops and pastures in 1990; <A HREF="refs.htm">ABS (1994)</A>.
The ABS figure is 475, 000 km2; roughly one third of the figure
derived in this study. However, the areas reported by the ABS
have two important qualifications: they do not equate to the total
area cleared, and the figures were derived by survey sampling
not census sampling as in this study. The figure published by
the ABS is the area used for crops in that year. In cereal cropping
areas with a 2-3 year crop rotation, it suggests that the total
area cleared for cropping may be three times that used in any
one year. Since the ABS reports that the area of crops peaked
at approximately 220, 000 km2 in 1983-84, then the total area
cleared for cropping alone may be 660, 000 km2.
<P>
The area cleared for the establishment of pastures was more difficult
to separately identify. Undoubtedly, in some agricultural areas
there is a reciprocal substitution of pasture and crop depending
on commodity prices. Nonetheless, there has been an expansion
of clearing for the establishment of sown pastures alone. This
clearing and establishment have been most marked in northern NSW,
and especially Queensland. Here the second set of figures adds
plausibility to the total figure derived in this study.
<P>
The estimates of landcover change published by <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>
were based on the manual interpretation of satellite data acquired
a decade ago. That survey recorded extensive thinning as well
as clearing of woodlands for the establishment or enhancement
of pastures. The aggregate figures produced by the AUSLIG survey
suggest that in the last 200 years, there has been a net increase
by thinning of 400, 000 km2 of open woodlands, and by clearing,
a net increase in grassland and pasture areas of 710, 000 km2.
The sum of these two AUSLIG estimates is markedly less than the
area of thinning and clearing that we measured, indicating an
alarming increase of those activities over the last decade.
<P>
No doubt there were uncertainties associated with both estimates
but it is unlikely that the agreement between the two census assessments
based on satellite data was fortuitous.<HR>

<H4>Distribution </H4>

<P>
Where is the clearing?
<P>
The distribution of the ILZ and the extent of clearing and thinning
within it, is shown in this ILZ disturbance image<B>. </B><HR>

<P>
<I>The continental distribution of disturbance by clearing. The
classes and colour codes are: uncleared (green); thinned (brown);
cleared (white); indeterminate (blue); lakes (black).</I><HR>

<P>
Clearing and thinning extends across the southern areas of the
continent, including the central area of Tasmania, and northwards
through Central Queensland. The most southerly areas of clearing
were associated with cereal cropping and improved pastures; that
in northern NSW and Central Queensland was mostly for the establishment
of pastures.
<P>
How to interpret the four disturbance classes displayed in this
image?
<P>
The three key classes are uncleared, thinned and cleared. These
were allocated as progressive steps from uncleared, where the
vegetation canopy was intact, to cleared, where the spectral signature
of the intact canopy was replaced by that of understorey. The
thinned class was an intermediate step within these two extremes
based solely on spectral signature; it was not primarily based
on the measurements of the degree of thinning, such as tree densities,
but the two are closely related. The decision rules for the allocation
of each pixel in this image to one of these three classes were
formulated after exacting expert interpretation, and consistently
applied. The image depicts our assessment of the extent and location
of vegetation disturbance by clearing as of approximately 1990.
<P>
The indeterminate class displayed in the<B> </B>image illustrates
the landcover types within the ILZ for which an assessment of
clearing disturbance could not be made.
<P>
The largest area was in the Northern Territory where localised
clearing, almost entirely for pastures, could be detected but
not reliably mapped. The areas involved, including the Ord River
irrigation development, were trivial compared with the clearing
in southern Australia.
<P>
The indeterminate areas outside the Northern Territory were the
landcover types without a woody overstorey, the grasslands, for
which the classification of clearing was inappropriate.
<P>
This is not to say that these landcover types are undisturbed.
Cultivation was detectable within the cleared grasslands (xG4)
on the west coast of Tasmania and within the most mesic grasslands
of the other States and Territories; see, for example, <A HREF="reptill/tasmania.gif">TASMANIA</A>.
The grasslands at the drier edges of the ILZ (xG3, xG2) are also
disturbed, principally by grazing.
<P>
This display of the clearing data-set also illustrates the nature
and strength of the uncertainties associated with the assessments
reported in this document. The error here is misclassification:
uncleared was classified as thinned or cleared, and the converse.
As explained earlier, because of the intrinsic nature of the source
satellite data-set and the fallibility of the expert process,
such errors can never be eliminated.
<P>
Rather, in this project, the uncertainty has been managed by minimising
and systematising the error by consistently biasing it in one
direction. With a focus on the uncleared class, a bias towards
the error of commission was preferred. That is, the uncleared
class decision rules were set to optimistic values, to err toward
a high value. Generally we achieved that so that the actual undisturbed
areas with the ILZ were less that the values reported here.
<P>
Errors of commission concerning the uncleared class are difficult
to demonstrate in the image. However, the converse, error of omission
where uncleared vegetation was labelled as thinned or cleared
can be illustrated.
<P>
Along the clearing boundaries of parts of Western Australia, South
Australia, Tasmania and northern Queensland, there are areas labelled
as cleared that are not. We encourage you to examine the images
of these areas provided in <A HREF="ausindex.htm">Exploring Your Country</A>.
In particular, you will find the images of <A HREF="map/townsvil.gif">TOWNSVILLE</A>,
<A HREF="map/clermont.gif">CLERMONT</A>, <A HREF="map/charlevi.gif">CHARLEVILLE</A>,
<A HREF="map/bourke.gif">BOURKE</A>, <A HREF="map/bronhill.gif">BROKEN HILL</A>,
<A HREF="map/adelaid.gif">ADELAIDE</A>, <A HREF="map/paugusta.gif">PORT AUGUSTA</A>,
<A HREF="map/tasmanll.gif">TASMANIA</A>, <A HREF="map/esperanc.gif">ESPERANCE</A>,
<A HREF="map/albany.gif">ALBANY</A>, <A HREF="map/perth.gif">PERTH</A>
and <A HREF="map/meekatha.gif">MEEKATHARRA</A> are of particular
interest.
<P>
This error could not be avoided, only minimised. There are two
principal sources of this error: problems intrinsic to the satellite
dataset, and limitations to separating clearing from significant
disturbance by grazing. Nevertheless, the nature and size of these
errors were small compared with the information content of this
dataset that is summarised in the remainder of this section.<HR>

<H4>Landcover Type </H4>

<P>
Is the clearing and thinning evenly distributed across all landcover
types?
<P>
Considering the entire ILZ, the distribution of disturbance by
clearing between landcover types is summarised in Table 6. A simple
index of Loss (thinned and cleared) was also calculated reflecting
the view that for the process of biotic erosion, there is little
difference between thinned and cleared.<HR>

<P>

distribution (%) of clearing within each landcover type. The grasslands
(xG) and low shrublands (xZ2) were excluded. The index Loss was
the sum of the cleared and thinned classes.

<P>
By far the largest clearing has taken place in the open eucalypt
forests (eM2), followed by the open eucalypt shrublands (eS2),
forests (eTML3), sparse forests (eM1) and so forth. The area cleared
within the first two landcover types accounts for 45% of the total
area cleared.<HR>

<H4>Tenure </H4>

<P>
Tenure is a land management tool; a type of landuse licence issued
by state governments. Landuse activities are prescribed and proscribed
by certain tenures, and clearing is one such activity. Thus, the
distribution of the landcover disturbance classes between various
tenure types reflects the management of clearing by state governments.
All six tenure types defined in <A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>
are represented within the ILZ and their relative sizes are illustrated
by the following tenure pie chart. <HR>

<HR>

<P>
Tenure type 1 (Freehold, Mining leasehold) and type 2 (Pastoral

ILZ.
<P>
What is the proportional area of each tenure type that is either
cleared or thinned?
<P>
The relative size of the area that was thinned and cleared relative
to the total area of that tenure type is displayed as the following
tenure-clearing pie chart. For tenure type 1 (Freehold, Mining),
this proportion was high (74%) and less so for tenure type 2 (35%)
the Pastoral (and Defence) tenures.<HR>

<P>
In absolute terms, these are the two tenures that contain the
cleared and thinned landcovers as would be expected. All of agriculture,
a replacement landuse, is held under Freehold tenure while most
pastoral activity, a harvesting landuse, is conducted mostly under
Pastoral tenure with some under Freehold.
<P>
Can we use this finding to check on the overall validity of our
assessment of clearing and thinning?
<P>
The tenure-clearing pie chart revealed that there was a small
occurrence of cleared and thinned classes within the tenure types
that offer high protection against clearing; types 4, 5 and 6.

<P>
In relative terms within each tenure type the error of omission
was large; up to 40% for tenure type 5 (Unused). However, in absolute
terms, it is less damaging. If we assume that there should be
no clearing at all in tenure types 3 to 6, then the proportion
of misclassified pixels was 108454 from a total of 549014; an
omission error rate of 20%.
<P>
This is a worst case error analysis which if continentally applicable,
reduces the total area thinned and cleared from 1, 550, 000 km2
to 1, 240, 000 km2.
<P>
We are confident that the error detected by this check was not
continentally applicable but we are unable to substantiate this
opinion. Nevertheless, this calculation is a measure of the uncertainty
associated with all aggregate measurements reported in this project.

<P>
The assessment of landcover disturbance for the ELZ was based
entirely on expert interpretation of the satellite image data.
As such, it was far more subjective and far less quantitative
in its result than the assessment for clearing.
<P>
Accepting these limitations, what were the findings for this type
of landcover within the ELZ?
<P>
This question is answered in three parts: how much?; where?; and
which landcover type was most affected?<HR>

<H4>Aggregate Area </H4>

<P>
The relative distribution of disturbance classes across all landcover
types aggregated indicates the largest area of the ELZ (62%) to
be only slightly or not disturbed, approximately 15% to be substantially
disturbed, and some 26% to be significantly disturbed. The latter
class was allocated only to landcover types within tenure types
1 (Freehold) and 2 (Pastoral). This was not an entirely surprising
result given the large proportion of the ELZ that is subject to
little or no grazing landuse.<HR>

Translating these figures from just the ELZ to the entire continent
we have: 37% was slightly or not disturbed, 9% was substantially
disturbed, and 15% was significantly disturbed.
<P>
The area of significantly disturbed landcover was approximately
the same as the area cleared (See Table 5).
<P>
In terms of the management of biotic erosion, the figures are
not as daunting as those for clearing because clearing represents
a far more severe and permanent impact than do the landcover impacts
of grazing<HR>

These differences in condition reflect both their relative distribution
within tenure types, and their resilience under grazing.
<P>
Most landcover types were only slightly disturbed. The significantly
disturbed landcover types were the open grasslands (xG2), and
the open and sparse Acacia forests and shrublands. The disturbance
status of many of these landcover types is presented in greater
detail in <A HREF="content5.htm">Case Studies</A>.<HR>

<H4>States And Territories </H4>
<HR>

<P>
An interesting question to ask at this point is who is responsible?
Who controls landuse?
<P>
The controls of landuse associated with each tenure type are set
by state governments and as a consequence, there is slight variation
between States and Territories.
<P>
The extent and location of clearing within a state as measured
in this project are thus a reflection of the history of land management
by individual States and Territories.
<P>
Thus it is informative to summarise clearing by state boundaries.
<P>
Beginning with clearing, Table 10 sets out the proportion of each
State of the ILZ, and within that, the relative distribution of
the three principal landcover disturbance classes.<HR>

<P>

<P>
From these relative figures, one appreciation of the landcover
condition of any State was gained by comparing the distribution
within the three levels of disturbance.
<P>
New South Wales and Queensland both have the largest proportion
of their ELZ areas in the significant disturbance class. In contrast,
South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory
have the largest proportion of their ELZ areas in the class of
least disturbance.
<P>
However, with absolute area this assessment was largely reversed:
the smallest area of landcover significantly disturbed by grazing
was in the ELZ of NSW (43, 000 km2), followed by South Australia
(160, 000 km2), Northern Territory (196, 000 km2), Queensland
(271, 000 km2), and Western Australia (482, 000 km2).
<P>
The two sets of figures above do not convey an overall assessment
of the status of landcover disturbance within each of the States
and Territories with the same power as does the view from space.
<P>
This view communicates the extent of landcover change as well
as its spatial patterning.
<P>
Even though we cannot quantify the relationship between the loss
of biodiversity and the extent and severity of landcover disturbance,
the view from space does give an overall appreciation of the task
confronting conservation efforts, especially within the ILZ.
<P>
Therefore we provide images of the ILZ for Queensland, New South
wales (incorporating the Australian Capital Territory), Victoria,
South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory
for the reader to interpret and contemplate.
<P>
Don't forget there is also an<B> <A HREF="reptill/ausmssal.gif">image of Australia </A>to

<H3>Additional Disturbance Factors </H3>
<HR>

<P>
Feral animals are significant agents of biotic erosion and they
are likely to exacerbate the consequences of landcover disturbance
by clearing and grazing. The distribution of feral animal density
varies across the continent. In broad terms, the simplest question
to ask of the feral animal distribution data is whether there
was a significant contrast between the ILZ and ELZ?
<P>
The answer to this question was not surprising and is presented
in graphical form.
<P>
The greatest presence of rabbits (low, moderate and high densities)
was found in the ILZ rather than the ELZ. The same can be said
for both foxes and pigs.<HR>

<P>
Conversely, the density of feral cats was evenly distributed between
the two landuse zones.
<P>
The conclusion that we draw from the graphs is that the highest
densities, and thus probable impacts on biodiversity, of rabbits,
foxes and pigs are coincident with the most significant landcover
disturbance, clearing.<HR>

<H3>A Bigger Picture </H3>
<HR>

<P>
How can we draw this all together?
<P>
The disturbance assessments applied to the ILZ and ELZ are qualitatively
distinct and thus have been separately reported as <A HREF="chap3a.htm#table5">Table 5</A>
and <A HREF="chap3b.htm#table8">Table 8</A>.
<P>
The two sets of figures cannot be simply aggregated.
<P>
Nonetheless, we present the following argument to support a combination
of these two sets of figures to produce a systematic continental
assessment. Further, we then use these figures to compare the
status of the Australian continent with global assessments compiled
by <A HREF="refs.htm">Hannah et al (1994, 1995)</A>.
<P>
For the ILZ, we have argued that with impact on biodiversity,
the thinned and cleared classes should be aggregated. By far the
largest proportion of the indeterminate class area was grasslands
or shrublands; disturbed by grazing but not cleared. This class
cannot be ignored but it should not be equated to uncleared.
<P>
In our opinion, compared with the impact on biodiversity of clearing,
the three levels of grazing disturbance assigned for the ELZ are
far less severe or permanent. The indeterminate class can by default
be added to the slightly disturbed class.
<P>
Therefore, we create a combined scale of landcover disturbance
with three levels: undisturbed (uncleared, slight), partially
disturbed (indeterminate clearing, substantial grazing), and significantly
disturbed (thinned and cleared, significant grazing). We stress
that this aggregation is based on personal judgement. What is
more important, it ignores the threat of feral animals.<HR>

<HR>

<P>
From the combined figure in <A HREF="#table12">Table 12</A>, more
than one third (35%) of the continent was significantly disturbed.
From the tenure figures of <A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>,
it can be determined that only 81% of the continental area is
subject to active landuse. The remainder is allocated to unused
(12%) or in conservation reserves (7%).
<P>
From this we can conclude that almost half of the landcover subject
to landuse was assessed by us as significantly disturbed.
<P>
How should we to interpret <A HREF="#table12">Table 12</A> in
terms of biotic erosion?
<P>
Many concerned individuals regard the land reserved by conservation
tenure as the only area worth considering in the difficult task
of preventing or slowing biotic erosion: only the National Parks
and nature reserves matter, the rest is lost.
<P>
In contrast, Pressey (1995), proposes a wider and more useful
plan for effective conservation to which we subscribe.
<P>
We believe the critical areas to be those which are significantly
disturbed. These are the areas most in need of remedial management.
<P>
In addition, we propose that for conservation management, the
partially and undisturbed areas are equivalent and deserve a lower
priority for action than the significantly disturbed areas. However,
we note that we are here ignoring the relentless impact of feral
species.
<P>
Lastly, how do the overall figures for Australia compare with
the other continents?
<P>
The most recent global figures on disturbance are those compiled
by Hannah et al (1994, 1995). Using different techniques, they
produce a three-level classification of disturbance that was overall
more severe than reported here. In our opinion, their most disturbed
category, human dominated, represents a greater level of disturbance
and irreversibility than used here. This was shown by their assessment
of Australasia being 62% undisturbed, 26% partially disturbed,
and 12% human dominated; Table 2 of Hannah et al 1994. The aggregate
of their last two categories (38%) was comparable with our most
disturbed category (35%).
<P>
Using this relationship, we recalculate Table 2 of Hannah et al
(1994) to produce a disturbance ranking of all the continents.
In relative terms, Australasia and South America have equal lowest
proportions of significantly disturbed landcover (38%), with Europe
containing the highest (86%). <HR>

<P>
Only the three critical classes, uncleared, thinned and cleared
are displayed. Where all one landcover was classified as indeterminate,
such as for the grasslands (xG), its disturbance rating was determined
by visual interpretation and reported in <A HREF="chap4c.htm">Disturbance by Grazing</A>.
<P>
For each type, the simplest index of Loss was calculated as the
aggregate area that was either thinned or cleared. This index
was arbitrarily rated and scored thus: &lt; 10% was low (* );
10-30% was moderate (** ); &gt; 30% was substantial ( ***).
<P>
A second index of habitat loss was derived from a measure of the
fragmentation of the remaining uncleared landcover patches. There
are many published indices of landscape pattern and fragmentation;
eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Turner (1990)</A>. However, since robust
relationships between the rate of biotic erosion and landcover
type and degree of fragmentation are lacking, there was little
point in computing complicated measures of landscape pattern;
eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Cale and Hobbs (1994), Hobbs (1994), Murcia (1995)</A>.
<P>
The calculation of the index of fragmentation comprised both objective
and subjective parts. The objective basis was, for each landcover
type, a graphical comparison of the cumulative distribution of
patch size between that mapped in Natural Vegetation, by definition
uncleared, with its contemporary fragmented condition measured
by satellite. This specimen fragmentation chart illustrates the

<I>A comparison of the cumulative distribution of proportional
uncleared patch size for the baseline (undisturbed) and contemporary
(fragmented) states. The degree of fragmentation was rated and
scored by the comparison of three curve attributes: ordinate,
slope and asymptote. This example is for the closed forests.</I>
<HR>

<P>
For this landcover type, there are 40 separate occurrences within
the ILZ. These patches are sorted by size, converted to a proportion
of the total area and plotted as a cumulative baseline curve.
The largest patch size alone constituted approximately 25% of
the total area (the ordinate); the next largest patch adds approximately
10% and so forth until the asymptote of 100% is reached with the
last and smallest patch.
<P>
The ordinate (proportion occupied by the largest patch) and the
shape of the curve as it approaches the asymptote express the
size ranks within the ILZ. In this example there are many small
patches; the last twenty patches accounting for just the remaining
20% of the total area.
<P>
The process was repeated for the contemporary uncleared patches.
With clearing, there will be more patches of smaller size than
the baseline set. Sorting these by size and plotting only the
first 40 patches, the same as the undisturbed yields a very different
shaped curve.
<P>
Three comparisons of the two curves indicate the degree of loss
and fragmentation: the ordinate (comparative size of the largest
uncleared patch); the shape of the curve; and the difference in
asymptotes, in this example 70% compared with 100%.
<P>
This simple objective comparison was quite insightful. A highly
cleared and fragmented landcover type will show large ordinate
differences; a flat curve generated by many small patches; and
a large disparity between the endpoints of the two curves. Conversely,
a little fragmented landcover type would return a curve similar
to the baseline. The first three case studies in the <A HREF="content5.htm">Case Studies</A>
are good illustrations of the nature of fragmentation. The graphical
comparison was subjectively rated and scored as either low ( *),
moderate (** ) or substantial (*** ).<HR>

<H3>Disturbance By Grazing </H3>
<HR>

<P>
For the ELZ, these two facets of landuse, grazing and burning,
dominate. However within the ILZ, and particularly along the boundaries
of the two zones, grazing, and to a much lesser extent, burning,
assume dominance over clearing as disturbance agents. Therefore
even though the assessment was notionally reported only for the
ELZ, the condition of the uncleared grazing land on the outer
margins of the ILZ was taken into account.
<P>
Tenure as well as landcover type boundaries were used in the assessment.
By definition, the disturbance status of all Unused land was assessed
as the lowest class, slight.
<P>
This assessment was reported simply as a table of the absolute
and relative areas in the four disturbance classes: slight (little
or no detectable impact); substantial (detectable but localised
impact); significant (widespread significant landscape change);
indeterminate (unable to interpret).
<P>
These four classes were assigned disturbance ratings of 0, 1,
2, and 0, respectively. A numeric measure was calculated as the
sum of the products of the proportional distribution of areas
and the respective disturbance ratings above and has a potential
range of 0-200. The rating and score were then assigned thus:
0-50 was low (*); 50-100 was moderate (**); &gt;100 was high (***).

<H3>Vulnerability To Future Disturbance </H3>
<HR>

<P>
The vulnerability to future disturbance is determined by dynamic
factors that drive landuse change; principally market demand,
new technologies or climatic shifts.
<P>
Equally important are the constraints to landuse change; such
as the intrinsic and static nature of the landscape itself, the
soils and topography, and the social dynamic of tenure.
<P>
All factors have, are, and will continue to interact, changing
both rapidly and slowly over decades. Only tenure, the critical
social control of landuse, was considered here; and for both the
ILZ and ELZ combined.
<P>
The assessment was focused on tenure vulnerability and was based
on the relative distribution of the area of each landcover type
between the tenure types set out in <A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>.
The six tenures listed in this Table offer different levels of
protection against future disturbance ranging from none, with
Freehold, to total protection with Conservation tenure. A numeric
measure was computed as the mean of the sum of the products of
the percentage area in each of the six tenure classes of <A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>
and their protection ratings (0-5). Based on this value, a vulnerability
rating and score was arbitrarily but plausibly set as low (* ,
&gt; 50% protected), moderate (** , 25-50% protected), and high
(*** , &lt; 25% protected). <HR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="table15"></A>Table 15</B>: The distribution of relative
area (%) of the six tenure levels for all landcover types within
the ILZ and ELZ. The score was based on the mean sum of the products
of the percentage areas and the tenure protection ratings that
are lowest with tenure type 1 and highest with tenure type 6.

<H3><B>Disturbance By Habitat Invasion</B></H3>
<HR>

<P>
The next most significant disturbance factor after habitat destruction
and fragmentation was habitat invasion by feral animals.
<P>
Only four species were considered; rabbits, foxes, cats and pigs.
Nonetheless, these four are regarded as the most significant contributors
to biotic impoverishment mediated through habitat destruction,
competition and predation; eg Newsome (1994).
<P>
The assessment of the current and future threat of all four species
was based on determining the relative distribution of each landcover
type within four mapped levels of feral animal density: none,
low, medium, high. In a similar manner to tenure vulnerability
discussed above, the three levels of feral vulnerability were
based on the mean of the sum of the products of proportional area
(%) and density class (0-3). The range of this numeric was 0-100,
and the thresholds used were low (&lt; 25, *), moderate (25-50,
**) and high (&gt; 50, ***). The respective scores for all four
feral species are set out in Table 16.<HR>

<H3><B>Disturbance By Fire</B></H3>
<HR>

<P>
This is a contentious area for two reasons: the continental datasets
are poor, and the relationships between current fire regimes and
biodiversity status are poorly understood.
<P>
Two simple descriptive statistics were derived for each landcover
type: the relative distribution of area among the five fire seasons
(Winter + Spring, Spring, Spring + Summer, Summer, Summer + Autumn)
and among the three fire frequencies (1-3 years, 5-10 years, and
&gt; 10 years).
<P>
The translation of these statistics into indices of disturbance
was based on the following reasoning that however plausible, is
not yet supported by detailed evidence. We argue that for fire
season, the greatest biodiversity disturbance is likely to result
from fires in the hottest time of the year. Therefore the fire
seasons were weighted for disturbance from Winter + Spring (0)
to Summer and Autumn (4). A three-class rating and score of disturbance
was then calculated as for feral density; low (0-25,*), moderate
(25-50**) and high (&gt; 50, ***).
<P>
For fire frequency, it was argued that the most frequent fires
offer the largest disturbance to biodiversity. Therefore, the
disturbance value of fire frequency classes was weighted as the
frequency; from high (2) for the highest frequency to low (0)
for the lowest frequency. In a similar manner, a numeric measure
was calculated from the mean aggregate product of proportional
areas and the disturbance rating; range 0-100. From this measure
a three-class rating and score of disturbance was then calculated;
low (0-25,*), moderate (25-50**) and high (&gt; 50, ***). The
respective fire disturbance scores are set out in Table 17.<HR>

<H3>Report Card</H3>
<HR>

<P>
In the Case Studies, all of these assessments are brought together
as one table. It is to be read and interpreted like a report card
with the exception that the score for each disturbance factor
is relative only for that factor. It was meant to compare between
landcover types and not across disturbance factors.
<P>
Because the relative importance of the individual disturbance
factors was large, eg clearing and fragmentation was judged to
be of far greater consequence than fire season, comparisons between
landcover types based on the total at the bottom of the table
will be misleading.
<P>
Thus, these scores are relative and not absolute numbers; there
can be no simple bottom line of the report card. Furthermore,
unlike traditional report cards, the lower the score (*) the better:
that is, the lower the score, the lower the actual and potential
landcover disturbance, and thus the lower the threat to impoverishment.
<HR>

<H4>The Scoreboard</H4>
<HR>

<P>
The purpose of generating <A HREF="tables.htm">Tables 13 - 17</A>
was to bring all the disturbance factors together simplified to
scores. These scores for each landcover type are relative within
that disturbance factor. Nonetheless, these five summaries can
be examined as a scoreboard and some interesting conclusions made.
<P>
From <A HREF="chap4b.htm#table13">Table 13</A>, it is apparent that a
high clearing score is usually matched by a high fragmentation
score. This is not an entirely surprising conclusion but it does
indicate the pervasiveness of the disturbance offered by clearing
to all landcover types within the ILZ.
<P>
In contrast, within the ELZ, <A HREF="chap4c.htm#table14">Table 14</A>,
only five of the thirty-one landcover types assessed were significantly
disturbed, five were substantially disturbed, and the remaining
nineteen were rated as slight. These large differences are generated
by the interaction of the relative areas subject to grazing and
the resilience of the landcover type to disturbance. Some landcover
types, such as the grasslands (xG), are resilient compared with
the mulga country (wS2). Furthermore, for all landcover types,
there is no correlation between the ILZ and ELZ disturbance scores.
<P>
The range of scores for tenure vulnerability is both limited and
high; <A HREF="chap4d.htm#table15">Table 15</A>. No landcover type is
well protected by tenure. This may be a somewhat surprising conclusion
given that 7% of the continent is within conservation reserves;
<A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>.
<P>
The density distribution of the four feral animal species varies
notably between landcover types; <A HREF="chap4e.htm#table16">Table 16</A>.
No single landcover type has a low or high score for all four
species.
<P>
Little comfort can be taken from this. We suspect that relationship
between feral animal density and the rate of biotic erosion is
non-linear with a low threshold; low densities are sufficient
to cause disproportionately high rates of other species loss.
<P>
Finally, the scoreboard for fire disturbance presents a contrast
between the two factors; <A HREF="chap4f.htm#table17">Table 17</A>. For
fire season, only seven landcover types have a low disturbance
score, with the majority being assessed as moderate. In contrast,
the fire frequency score is assessed as low for the majority of
types. The extremes of these two disturbance factors are not correlated:
no landcover type has a low or high score for both fire season
and fire frequency. <HR>

<B>A new history!</B> 
<P>
The <A HREF="kakall.gif">image</A> of what was happening on the
ground in Kakadu National Park on the morning of September 2,
1986 will never die! That is an interesting thought! Not only
do we have an enormously powerful tool at our disposal that has
provided a unique view of our environment, we also have powerful
way of exactly recording the state of that environment at that
time. Never before in human history has there been such a powerful
mechanism with which to assess and monitor the condition of our
living environment. What is more, the same imaging device that
captured this wildfire on September 2, 1986 is still operating
10 years later. In the intervening period, it has captured an
additional 200 images of this exact area of Kakadu National Park.
Like the image that we have used, these newly acquired images
will also never die. The data that constitute these images are
painstakingly archived and await analysis by those who want to
look backwards to better understand what awaits us.

<B>Space images are new! </B>
<P>
In the last twenty years, frequent exposure to satellite images,
such as the cloud images used in TV weather segments, has generated
a familiarity with space images that disguises just how modern
this technology is. Three thousand years ago, Greek natural philosophers
(scientists) deduced from its shadow on the Moon that the shape
of planet Earth was a sphere. That deduction was not completely
confirmed until 1969 when a small and privileged group of United
States astronauts en route to the Moon observed that the Earth
is truly a globe.
<P>
The most revealing views of Earth are not to be had on its surface.
An individual standing on top of Mt Everest with the best telescope
available and under the best viewing conditions, might be able
to see about 0.000025% of the total surface of the Earth. It is
difficult to appreciate and describe the curved surface of a sphere
with surface observations only. Cartography was crude and inaccurate
until aerial photography provided a new perspective from 10 kms
or so above the surface of the Earth. Now observations from heights
of 1000 kms, or in the case of the TV weather cloud images, 30
000 km are routine. Nonetheless it is notable to remember that
until remote sensing technology became routinely available, it
was easier to draw maps of the Moon than of the Earth.

<B>The limits of small.</B> 
<P>
A ground resolution unit of 60 m x 80 m is human scale because
it is approximately the area of a football field. It is something
we can visualise and comprehend. But this cognisance becomes more
difficult as the unit of ground resolution or pixel, increases
in size. For example, another type of satellite, the NOAA AVHRR
system, has a pixel size of 1000 m x 1000 m.

<P>
That is, this imaging system averages the landscapes into points
or pixels that are 1 kilometre on a side; a unit of resolution
that is difficult to visualise or comprehend. It is the same resolution
used for reporting the findings of this project. If you stand
at any point, in the city or the country, and imagine that the
different brightness of every component within a square pixel
1 x 1 kilometre in size is averaged to just one value, you would
easily be persuaded that the result will be meaningless or of
very little value. It is a difficult concept to grasp! Nevertheless,
when we view a NOAA AVHRR image, the patterns and colours make
sense. We can interpret what we see. We have no difficulty with
the whole, only with the component parts, the pixels. This difficulty
will pass!

<B>The new truth.</B> 
<P>
Satellite data are objective. Satellite data are acquired, transmitted
and archived by machines. No human editing, biasing or censorship
is involved in the data acquisition stage. Each pixel is an objective
measurement of the condition of the surface of the Earth. The
data coding the relative brightness in each waveband for each
pixel are collected systematically in space as well as in time
with a census sample; ie. complete coverage of the surface of
the Earth. It is only in the final stage of interpretation that
subjective interpretation occurs. That presents no problems. If
you and I disagree about the interpretation of a satellite image
in this book, that is healthy and good for science. We can differ
only about our interpretation and not about the data. The data
that we both use, the image, remain the same. Satellite data are
objectively acquired and there are enormous volumes of it. Within
the national satellite archives in Canberra, there are approximately
250 Landsat MSS images of every pixel of the Australian continent
since mid-1972.
<P>
There is a very great contrast between the systematic, objective
measurement systems onboard satellites and the assessment and
monitoring of our environment that people do. Our assessment is
subjective rather than objective and it is based on a very small
sample in comparison with the complete 'wall-to-wall' coverage
of satellite imaging systems. The greatest disparity is in the
way in which we humans monitor the world around us compared with
what can be achieved using satellite data. Our archive of what
the world was like is our memory. Our memory, our operational
archive, is, unfortunately seriously flawed in its creation and
fallible in its retrieval. We selectively remember things in the
first instance and then do not always recall all relevant information.
As an archive, we are biased and forgetful. These failings shape
our lives because we are what we remember. That is the nature
of human beings; a nature that is the product of the way we have
evolved during the last million years or so.
<P>
It is a characteristic of our behaviour to react to rapid or episodic
change in preference to slow and monotonous change. It's far easier
to occupy ourselves with the daily micro-hassles of life than
with changes occurring over the longer term. Our social, political
and economic lives are dominated by the now rather than the critically
important future. This domination is largely dictated by our media
that, with words, images and skill, force our concentration on
daily trivia, eg. a knee operation for a football player, while
completely ignoring the long term changes, such as the relentless
increase in the atmospheric concentration of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) and greenhouse gases.
<P>
Now, bearing all of these points in mind, we can ask a simple
yet important question: If you wanted to discover what was really
happening to your world, which archive would you tap? Would you
use the collective human memory? This archive we know to be familiar
but neither objective, complete or systematically updated. Or
would you rather access a database that has it all there? A database
of objective measurements, not subjective impressions, that was
made systematically in space and in time?

<B>The new colours.</B> 
<P>
Because satellites work above the atmosphere, satellite sensor
systems must completely ignore the blue part of the visible spectrum
because blue light is scattered by the atmosphere. This phenomenon,
called Rayleigh scattering, explains why the sky is blue and why
sunsets are orange to red in colour. An image of the Earth's surface
in the blue wavelengths would usually be fuzzy and blurred. However,
the colour blue is always used in displaying the information in
these images.

<B>The endless truth.</B> 
<P>
Any involvement with satellite data rapidly generates a realisation
of the immense volumes of data that are required to create, store,
and then recreate images. Let's work through an example using
the full Landsat MSS scene that contained the introductory wildfire.
<P>
This image comprised ~2 600 lines, each of which was made up of
~2 600 pixels. This image is best visualised as an array of 2
600 columns and 2 600 rows giving a total of ~7 000 000 locations
or cells in the array. For Landsat MSS with 4 wavebands, this
gives a total of 28 000 000 numbers to represent one image.

<P>
<B>Landsat in Australia.</B>
<P>
 This satellite, like most Earth observing satellites, orbits
the planet from pole to pole with each orbit taking about 100
minutes. That orbit is fixed and the Earth rotates below the orbiting
satellite. The instruments onboard each spacecraft image the Earth's
surface directly below, usually in a continuous strip. If you
imagine the reverse process - that the satellite is wrapping the
globe with a continuous strip of bandage - Landsat-5 completely
covers the Earth every 16 days. Thus every 16 days, Landsat-5
can acquire a fresh image of every part of the planet, cloud cover
permitting. In Australia, the Data Access Facility (DAF) or Receiving
Station at Alice Springs systematically tracks and records data
for the Australian continent and its surrounds every day of the
year.
<P>
The orbit of Landsat, like most other satellites, is sun synchronous;
ie. the satellite passes over any location at the same local time
of day. For Australia this time is approximately 0930 hours AEST
and Landsat passes North to South. The orbital paths are inclined
about 12 degrees from geographic north.

STANDARD PRACTICE AND RESEARCH EXCELLENCE</H4><BR>If there are well defined standards, it places research and developmentinto context and protects it from being confused with operational production.Research is needed in cases where the standard processing is inadequate,where it does not solve the user's problems and also needed to create newproducts which may eventually become standard processes. The important advancefor researchers in this situation is that when users ask researchers totry new methods because the standard ones are inadequate it is they, andnot the researchers, who take on the risk that the result may not be anybetter.<BR><BR>Having a solid base of established standards also puts into context thedifficult issue of &quot;Best Practice&quot;. I think the name is the problem!It is always better to use &quot;Best Current Practice&quot; and even betterjust to say &quot;Standard Practice&quot;. I think that 'best practice'is actually what the 'best people' do and always will be. It is impossibleto specify the 'best' or create it by documentation and imposition of measuresof success. What it is possible to specify is the currently acceptable standardsand it is in everyone's interest that these standards exist and providea measure against which new methods can prove their worth.<BR><BR>The area where research lives is in the quest for the best but it may notbe that current research really is better. The measure of 'better' to theuser lies as much in repeatability and consistency as it does in the incorporationof more 'realistic' components or complex physics. However, the researcherneeds to have room to explore and can move the horisons to create what maybe tommorrow's standards.<BR><BR>An example of such a slow but sure process can be seen in evaporation methodsas practiced in Irrigation Engineering. In evaporation standard practicethe scientifically superior Penman-Monteith method has taken many years(more than 30) to become included in the standard manuals. It has had tobe proven in operational practice to be simply applicable, reliable, consistentand even conservative so that it could replace tried although maybe notvery true methods in use for many years in operational calculations of &quot;Consumptive&quot;Water Use.<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="wshop2.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="wshop4.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

OUTCOMES AND DISCUSSIONS FROM THE LAND AVHRR WORKSHOP</B><BR><BR>Data receiving stations should process data so that the base and standardproducts are both correct and repeatable within and between stations. Thatis, for the same region observed by two stations during a single overpassboth the base and standard product digital counts must be the same. <UL><LI>1. Accurate and quantifiable measures of correctness should be definedjointly and then adhered to. <LI>2. Geometric accuracy was suggested to be at RMS of 1pixel. This qualityspecification can be determined by a number of GCP's being selected in eachimage to ensure that the geometric accuracy is being meet. <LI>3. Absolute radiometric correction was suggested to be specifiable to5%. The main issue for such a specification is how to provide the supportingmeasures. Options include a combination of ground based or remotely senseddata collected from other satellite systems to enable radiometric qualityto be documented for both base and standard products. <LI>4. Additional data quality levels to the receiving stations standardsshould be produced and monitored by appropriate groups. </UL>There needs to be understanding of the complexities involved by all membersof the AVHRR community. For example, all members would like a correct, accurateand fast cloud detection and cloud contamination algorithm in place in allreceiving stations. Some initial research has been undertaken on this topic.However, due to computational demands few if any algorithms have been operationallyimplemented. There still exists the opportunity that research will be ofbenefit due to a combination of algorithm development and faster processingcomputers. We would all like the AVHRR data to be physically correct andobtainable in a timely fashion to predefined standards. To do this, we mustdefine the problems and offer solutions to them. There is an important opportunityand obligation for CSIRO to engage some basic research. Solutions shouldbe scientifically correct and also operationally implementable. This hasobvious advantages to all members of the AVHRR community.<BR><BR>Several issues were raised about how to ensure that present data archivesare made consistent and correct. Such archives will form a baseline forfuture environmental monitoring projects and the need to ensure correctnessand consistency is paramount. It was decided that rather then reprocessall images based on the notion that someone may want to use such data inthe future, what is required is the knowledge, and specifications to beclearly, completely and correctly documented to allow reprocessing of specialdata archives. Is all this information known and documented?<BR><BR>It is thought that CSIRO Marine Labs, CSIRO DAR, AIMS, WASTAC and the BofMetneed to get their systems all consistent and meeting the same common setof standards. Operational running of receiving stations and base data archivingalso needs to be eventually transferred from CSIRO to BofMet. There is currentlyan agreement being discussed between the two organisations and greater discussionsneed to be undertaken not only between these two but also include ACRESand the AIMS/Townsville facility. <BR><BR>Data standards need to address the needs of the user community. Most importantis the operational data user community, those agencies who are currentlyusing AVHRR data to make management decisions. Any changes to data formats,standards etc need to be documented and feedback from the user communityobtained before they take place. This needs to be rigorously planned andimplemented on predetermined known dates and not undertaken in an ad hocway.<BR><BR>There were also concerns about data availability expressed by some membersof the user community. Management systems have been developed in which AVHRRdata are the central element and continuity, both of geometrically and radiometricallycorrect data must be ensured to the level of control that the data acquisition,base and standard product community have. Also, issues of CSIRO data gatherersproviding data to research applications internal to CSIRO must be addressed.This is an issue for CSIRO to address possibly under the banner of the recentlyformed EOC.<BR><BR>People must be willing to accept that some changes in the Australian AVHRRreception and subsequent processing pathways will occur. The changes willallow for a better consistent national set of standards to be met. All membersof the remote sensing community that receive, process and use AVHRR datamust be taken into account before any changes are made.<BR><HR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="avout2.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="avout4.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/next.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

\#G 1993.132 Performed by ESA History Project, University of Rome. Team
consists of Professor De Maria; Dr J Krige, European University Institute;
and Professor Russo, University of Palermo. Book describes crucial contribution
of Italian physicist and science administrator Edoardo Amaldi to the creation
of European Space Research Organisation (particularly its west-European
and non-military bias) and its uneasy relationship with the European Launcher
Development Organisation (largely formed, in De Maria's view, as a means
of justifying the Blue Streak and French , military-derived launcher programs.
Amaldi worried that these political, military and industry imperatives would
end up setting the scientific research agenda). Published by ESA Publications

\#G 1993.133 Performed by ESA History Project, University of Rome. Team
consists of Professor De Maria; Dr J Krige, European University Institute;
and Professor Russo, University of Palermo. Book describes the four years
which &quot;..were the most important in the history of European cooperation
in space. They marked the end of the illusion that ESRO's sister organization
ELDO could ever build an all European heavy satellite launcher, and the
transformation of ESRO itself from an organization solely devoted to scientific
research to one mainly engaged in the domain of application satellites.
Facing the growing political and economic importance of space activities,
European governments were involved in long and painful discussions about
the possible definition of a coherent space policy for the Old Continent,
trying to find a compromise between conflicting national interests. In 1973
this compromise was finally agreed on, starting a process which led in 1975
to the birth of the European Space Agency (ESA), out of the ashes of ELDO
and the wealth of ESRO. &quot; Published by ESA Publications Division, ESTEC,

\#G 1993.134 Performed by ESA History Project, University of Rome. Team
consists of Professor De Maria; Dr J Krige, European University Institute;
and Professor Russo, University of Palermo. Book describes origins (including
background in political, military and industrial development theory) of
the European Space Vehicle Launcher Development Organization, established
in 30 April 1962 (signing of ELDO Convention by Italy, Britain, France,
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Australia). The Convention came into
force on 29 February 1964. Emphasises role of Blue Streak project; &quot;
ELDO then was a child of political, not technical parentage. In particular,
it was a child of the Macmillan government, which saw the rocket [Blue Streak]
as at once enabling it to achieve a measure of independence from the United
States and to draw closer to its continental partners, and indeed to the
newly-fledged European Economic Community. There were other arguments of
course for continuing with the project - but it was these political concerns
that dominated the thinking of Macmillan and Thorneycroft from the time
the Blue Streak missile was cancelled.&quot; Refer also 1993.132, 1993.133

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY><HR><H2><CENTER>Land AVHRR Data Users Group Workshop -<BR>Towards Product Standards</CENTER></H2><HR><H4>4. BRINGING PRODUCERS AND USERS TOGETHER</H4><BR>In order to bring about these standards, it is important that Australiawork closely with any moves or existing progress in these directions inthe international community. However, there is a need for Australian usersand data or value added product producers to get together and define whatthe needs of Australian users are - whatever the progress or lack of progressinternationally. In the case of Land AVHRR Data I think the need is critical.This Workshop is an ideal place to start the process as there are researchers,data providers, value adders and some end users all meeting together todiscuss the issues facing the 'industry'. Let's not waste the opportunity.<BR><BR>In any transaction of the kind we are discussing, involving a producer anda user, there are two risks that must be minimised or at least balancedif the transaction is to be fair and even for it to keep occurring. Theseare the &quot;Producer's Risk&quot; and the &quot;User's Risk&quot;. Theyassume there is a measure of quality available for the product and a strategyof testing. In this case, the producers risk is the probability that a perfectlygood product will be rejected as poor and the consumer's risk is the probabilitythat a product called acceptable is poor. Clearly, standards, measures andstrategies of testing must all be developed by users and producers togetherto create a situation everyone can live with. In practice, the financialviability of a product to the producers may be an important component inthe definition of a standard.<BR><BR>In our area of AVHRR data and products there are two forums for standards.These are the interface between data producers and data users (or valueadders) and the interface between value adders and the end users. In theend, the two will form part of the same 'sentence' and need to be compatible:<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>&quot;With data produced at certified Level x, using processing methodsoutlined in manual y, with staff and infrastructure of capability z it ispossible to produce specified product p with accuracy q.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Perhaps this Workshop, with its useful blend of researchers, data managers,data suppliers, value adders and users, can outline the cases where Australianusers can fill in the gaps in sentences like this one and help define whatLevel x is for the benefit of the data producers. Perhaps there is no existingsentence of this type of which we can be confident. In either case, whatare the base standards, what can reliably and consistently be achieved andwhat measures can we put into place to ensure in the future (to the benefitof producers and users alike) that they are being met? I claim that althoughthe answers to these questions do not always involve scientific issues ofinterest to leading edge researchers it is in their interest and essentialfor their long term survival that some answers be found.<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="wshop3.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

RECOMMENDATIONS<BR></B><BR>Out of the wide ranging discussions and issues addressed there were threewhich were agreed as of particular importance for the AVHRR community toachieve as soon as possible. These are: <UL><LI>Data receiving stations should process data so that the base and standardproducts are consistent and to a specifiable and repeatable standard withinand between stations; <LI>Geometric accuracy should aim to be RMS of 1pixel with recommended algorithmsand processing plus measures of quality to be developed and implementedas the next step; <LI>Absolute radiometric correction should aim to 5% with measures of qualityto be developed and implemented as the next step. </UL>The resonsibility for taking steps to achieve these recommendations restsjointly with CSIRO, BofMet, WASTAC, AIMS as well as the prime data usersin the State and Commonwealth Departments. Therefore a fourth recommendationis: <UL><LI>CSIRO EOC should convene a group consisting of data receivers and datausers to establish the workable solutions for these goals. </UL><BR>Tim McVicar <BR>May 1, 1996<BR><HR><A HREF="eoc.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/eochome.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="avout3.htm"><IMG SRC="../gifs/previous.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR></BODY></HTML>

<p align="center"><font size="6"><b>How to Use the </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0080" size="7"><em><b>Mutual
Fund Bulletin</b></em></font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="jazzy.gif"></p>

<p><font size="6"><strong>D</strong></font>on't be fooled by the
elegant simplicity of the Mutual Fund Bulletin. As you can see,
it is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it generates enormous
profits when followed correctly and with proper discipline.<br>
</p>

<p>Our research and computer analysis are designed to select and
choose mutual funds for at least a four-week period. Our system
is not designed to trade intra-week or inter-day. Remember, all
the funds on our Top 50 list are technically very strong. We
don't sell a fund based solely on a few good or bad days of
trading. <br>
</p>

<p>However, we will send you a <i><u>SPECIAL FLASH UPDATE</u></i>
anytime our Best intermediate Term Timing System (BITS) signals a
major change in stock market direction.<br>
</p>

<p>We also have a telephone hotline that is updated <i>every
Monday by 9:00 am eastern time</i>. This hotline will give you the
current position of BITS and any portfolio changes.<br>
</p>

<p>The Mutual Fund Bulletin features 4 Model Portfolios. The <i>first
portfolio</i> uses the Rydex Family Of Funds (1-800-820-0888) in
conjunction with our BITS market timing system. This is known as
our INDEX FUNDS PORTFOLIO. By using these funds (Nova, OTC and
Ursa) we can go both long and short depending on the signal from
the market timing system. Rydex Nova is an S&amp;P500 index fund.
Rydex OTC is a NASDAQ index fund. Rydex Ursa is an index fund
that is short the S&amp;P500.<br>
</p>

<p>BITS was developed in late 1988 and was tested on historical
data from 1963 to 1988. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P500 index were
used to generate the buy/sell signals and compute the returns. Since 1989,
BITS has been in use real-time and it has proven itself in both
backtesting and actual trading. On average it signals a trade
every 4 months. The accuracy rating is over 80%, with every 4 out
of 5 winning trades. The compounded annualized return is over 24%
per year.<br>
</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why we are using the Rydex
family of funds for trading BITS signals. <u>Rydex Nova</u> is an S&amp;P500
index fund with a beta of 1.5. This means when BITS is correct in
its long signal, you make 50% <i>more</i> than the S&amp;P500
index itself. <u>Rydex OTC</u> is the an index fund that tracks the
Nasdaq index. The combination of Rydex Nova and OTC lets us
participate in both the large and the small-cap stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>Rydex is the only family that offers a fund that is short the
S&amp;P500. This makes <u>Rydex Ursa</u> a rather unique fund. It goes
up when the S&amp;P500 goes down and vice-versa. This means when BITS
is correct in its cash/short signal you can make money as the
S&amp;P goes down. If you are able to find other similar funds,
you may be able to substitute them for the Rydex funds. Jack
White &amp; Company (1-800-233-3411) offers all three Rydex funds
while Charles Schwab offers only the Nova fund.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>second portfolio</i> consists of no-load funds that can
be bought and sold through Charles Schwab (1-800-2-NO-LOAD) or
Jack White (1-800-233-3411). This is known as our NO-LOAD FUNDS PORTFOLIO and
it consists of funds from excellent families like Twentieth Century,
Janus, Invesco, Berger, Oakmark, Strong, Steinroe, Founders,
Montgomery, Lexington, Cappiello-Rushmore, IAI, Dreyfus, Kaufmann
and many others. These funds are also available through the
Fidelity Funds Network (1-800-544-7777).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>third portfolio</i> is called the FIDELITY GROWTH
PORTFOLIO and it consists of 4 <i>diversified</i> Fidelity funds. The <i>fourth
portfolio</i> is called the FIDELITY SECTOR PORTFOLIO and it
consists of 4 Fidelity Select <i>sector</i> funds. Fidelity
Select funds have a <i><u>one time</u></i> 3% sales load. After
that you may switch to other funds within the family without any
loads. There is also a $7.50 redemption charge which can be
avoided by using their automated telephone touch-tone trading
system. Fidelity can be reached at 1-800-544-8888.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>How To Get Started<br>
<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><b>1. Choose One Or More Model Portfolios</b> </p>

<p><b>2. Invest In Those Mutual Funds That Have A </b><b><u>Buy</u></b><b>
Rating.</b> </p>

<p><b>3. Sell When A </b><b><u>Sell</u></b><b> Signal Is Given<br>
<br>
</b></p>

<p>Once you have decided on a portfolio to follow, you can decide
what to buy. For each portfolio, an allocation percentage is
listed next to each fund. Use this allocation to decide how many
shares to buy depending on your <i>personal</i> portfolio/account
size. Every portfolio gives you a specific percentage for each
mutual fund. <u>Just multiply this percentage by the total amount
of money you have to invest. This way any size investment can be
accommodated.<br>
</u></p>

<p>You'll then see the individual funds in every issue of the
Mutual Fund Bulletin. You simply invest in the mutual funds that are
in your selected portfolio. Whenever there is a change, just call
your broker or mutual fund and ask them to switch your money to
the recommended fund. By keeping your money in a winning fund,
you automatically win.<br>
</p>

<p>When you get the next issue of the Mutual Fund Bulletin, check
your selected model portfolio and look at the <u>Status</u> of your
fund. Sell your fund when a sell signal is given. Then purchase
the new recommendation. It is as simple as that.<br>
</p>

<p>Please remember ... <i><u>patience and discipline</u></i> are
the two most important cornerstones of successful investing.
Don't expect miracles or think you'll get rich overnight. Also,
don't let the day to day market volatility and ups and downs bother
you. That is all part of investing in the stock market. <u>Focus
on the longer-term. Look at the bigger picture. Think where you
want to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now.<br>
</u></p>

<p>Jumping around from one investment program to the next can be
detrimental to your wealth building efforts. Once you have found
a good system, like the Mutual Fund Bulletin, try it for at least
2-3 years before passing judgment on it.<br>
</p>

<p>We at the Mutual Fund Bulletin hope to make your investing
profitable and enjoyable. </p>

the</b></font><font color="#008000" size="6"><b> </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="7"><em><b>Growth
Stocks Report</b></em></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6"><b><img src="jazzy.gif"></b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="7">D</font><font size="3">on't be
fooled by the elegant simplicity of the Growth Stocks Report. As
you can see, it is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it
generates enormous profits when followed correctly and with
proper discipline.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our <i>Alpha()-RSM System</i> is designed to
ferret out those stocks that have a high alpha as well as high relative
strength &amp; momentum. Alpha is that measure of the return that
is not explained by the general market. For example, if the S&amp;P500
has an average monthly return of 1.5% and a stock has an average
monthly return of 8.5%, then the stock has an alpha of 7%. This
7% is the excess return that the stock generates over the general
market.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Once we have selected our list of 400 high
alpha stocks, we run them through our proprietary mathematical
models that rank them based on their relative strength and
momentum. We want to buy only those high alpha stocks that also
have high relative strength and are going up at the present time. We
have no interest in stocks that are going sideways, or worse, are
going down.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The top 100 stocks are then presented in each
issue of the Growth Stocks Report. Their percent change over the
past 1, 3 , 6 and 12 months is also shown. Stocks from the top of
the list are added to the model portfolios as space becomes
available in them, i.e., when we sell some stocks. We do not necessarily
sell a stock in the model portfolio when it falls out of the top
100.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our research and computer analysis are designed
to select and choose growth stocks for at least a one month
period. Our system is not designed to trade intra-week or
inter-day. Remember, all the stocks on our Top 100 list are technically
very strong. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We don't sell a stock based solely on a few
good or bad days of trading. Therefore, we will not issue a buy
or sell signal on individual stocks between issues. <br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6"><b>How Do I Start?<br>
<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Each portfolio is designed to provide a
different level of diversification ranging from 10 stocks to 40. Once
you have decided which level of diversification you wish to
follow, you can decide what to buy. As a new subscriber you have three
options when you start building your portfolio.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>1.</b> The aggressive option is to go ahead
and buy all stocks in your selected model portfolio at their current
prices. This way you'll be fully invested instantly. Even though
some of these stocks may be up 100-200% since we bought them, it doesn't
mean that they cannot go up another 100% or more from these
levels.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>2.</b> The more conservative option is to
buy only those stocks that have a new buy recommendation for that
month and leave the rest of your portfolio in cash. This way,
it'll take you a few months to get fully invested, but you'll be
buying each stock at the most appropriate time and price.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>3.</b> If you decide not to follow one of
our model portfolios, you may use this list of 100 most attractive stocks
to pick and choose and build your own personal portfolio. <i><u>One</u></i><i>
strategy</i> is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of
that list. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 100. When a stock
drops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top of
the list. This is just <u>one</u> way of using the list. You may
prefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit your personal taste.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For each portfolio, the number of shares is
listed next to each stock. Because we are perpetuating a portfolio,
you should adjust the number of shares to accommodate your
personal portfolio. When first starting, is preferable to invest equal
dollar amounts into each of your new buys rather than overweighting
any one particular issue. When you get the next issue of the <i>Growth
Stocks Report</i>, check your selected model portfolio. You'll
notice that the new sells and new buys in each issue are highlighted
in <i>italics</i>. Sell a stock when a sell signal is given. Then
purchase the new recommendation. It is as simple as that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Set Realistic Expectations -
Discipline Is Your Key To Success<br>
<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Can we expect 100% plus returns every year. It
would be great, but it just isn't realistic. In fact 100% returns
happen once only 4 or 5 years. We don't know when that is going
to happen. That is why we need to fully invested in the best high-alpha,
high-RSM growth stocks.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Many investors, particularly those with less
than 5 years experience with their own money in the market, have unrealistically
high expectations regarding returns. This is perhaps the biggest
source of frustration for newer investors. Over a 10-year period,
stocks will be up only about 65 percent of the time on average.
The rest of the days are spent drifting sideways or falling.
These negative periods can last months or even years. The good
news is that our Alpha()-RSM System can find the best stocks even
when the general stock is going down.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Successful investing requires a mental
determination and emotional commitment to stay invested for at least
one market cycle, which usually lasts four to six years. Often
investors lack the stamina to hold out through high period of
volatility. They bail out, usually at the worst possible moment, forgetting
that the extraordinary returns generated by small-cap stocks will
eventually compensate them for the risk or volatility.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Please remember ... <i>patience and discipline</i>
are the two most important cornerstones of successful investing.
Don't expect miracles or think you'll get rich overnight. Also,
don't let the day to day market volatility and ups and downs bother
you. That is all part of investing in the stock market. Focus on
the longer-term. Look at the bigger picture. Think where you want
to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Generally, the longer you can leave your money
in the market, the more risk you should be willing to take. You
also need a proven investment strategy. Without a plan, investors
often jump from one idea or philosophy to another.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Jumping around from one investment program to
the next can be detrimental to your wealth building efforts. Once
you have found a good system, like the <i>Growth Stocks Report</i>,
try it for at least 2-3 years before passing judgment on it.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Don't expect to make money each and every
month. When faced with the inevitable down periods, don't lose
patience and throw in the towel. Hang in there. Wait for the
right opportunities, because sooner or later, they will surely
come. We at Growth Stocks Report hope to make your investing profitable
and enjoyable.</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Frequently Asked Questions
about the Growth Stocks Report<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. When is the newsletter published?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. The Growth Stocks Report is published by the
5th of every month. The prices in the newsletter are as of the
last business day of the previous month. We finish our analysis
by the 4th of the month, and then the newsletter is faxed or mailed
by the 5th. Like any other monthly service, there will always be
a lag of 4-5 days from last months close. In fact, some of the
time this lag may work in your favor.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Is there a telephone hotline?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Yes, we have a telephone hotline that is
updated by the 5th of every month. This hotline was established
so that we may be able to bypass mail delays. It contains our
list of top 10 stocks for the month and any new buys or sells for
each of the model portfolio. A second hotline has been added to provide
informational updates on stocks that have had significant moves
either up or down. This second hotline is updated weekly by 9 am
every Monday. Both hotlines were included on a brightly colored
card included with your kit and are available 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Do I buy at the market or at the price
listed in the newsletter?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. When you get the newsletter via mail or FAX,
and decide to buy a stock, just buy it at the market. In some
cases you will get a worse fill than the price listed in the
newsletter and in other cases you will get a better fill. Over
time, your fills should average out. A good rule of thumb to follow
is to not purchase a stock 30% higher than our buy price and to not
buy it 30% lower than our buy price.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Do you use stops or time the market?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. No market timing or stops are used in the
Growth Stocks Report. All portfolios remain fully invested 100%
of the time. If you wish to use stops, you must be responsible
for determining at what price you wish to implement them. These
stops would be based upon your own personal tolerance for risk.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. How do you select stocks?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Our stock selection process incorporates
both fundamental and technical criteria. Every month, we screen
thousands of stocks looking for the handful that have the
potential for spectacular stock price increases. We are we
looking for emerging companies poised for enormous growth or established ones
that are about to make major advances. We want companies whose
products are in such demand that they can't make them fast
enough. Ones with entrepreneurial leadership that is taking advantage
of technological breakthroughs to create new, super-fast growing
businesses. And we want to find them before they're discovered by
the financial media and hordes of investors. So we can buy them ahead
of the pack and take full advantage of the run-up in their
stocks. We set very strict risk/reward guidelines and whittle the
possibilities down to a handful of companies with superior balance
sheets and liquidity and little or no debt. Then we take this
short list and subject it to a rigorous proprietary system based
on cutting-edge computerized technical analysis. This system ranks
the stocks according to their short-term momentum and relative
strength. We list the top 100 in every issue of the Growth Stocks
Report and when there is space, we add the ones at the top of this
list to our model portfolios.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Are these stocks risky?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. On an individual stock basis, these
small-cap stocks are quite volatile and most people would characterize
them as being very risky. <u>That is why you must diversify over
at least 10-15 stocks, preferably more</u>. If you have 15 stocks
in your portfolio and if four of them lose 25% each, your total portfolio
loss is only 6.66%. Furthermore, its quite possible that some of
the other stocks in the portfolio will go up thereby making up
for the small loss. That is why it is imperative that you diversify your
holdings over a number a stocks.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. My stock is down 5 points in 2 days. Are
you going to sell the stock?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. We don't sell a stock based solely on a few
good or bad days of trading. Therefore, we will not issue a buy
or sell signal on individual stocks between issues. Our research
and computer analysis are designed to select and choose growth
stocks for at least a one month period. Our system is not designed
to trade intra-week or inter-day. Remember, all the stocks on our
Top 100 list are technically very strong.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. My stock is up 250%. Should I take
profits and sell?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. No. Wait till the next issue comes out. If
we deem it to be a sell, it'll be sold. But till we ask you to sell
it, don't sell just because it is up substantially.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. A certain stock is down 4 points. Are you
still recommending it?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Yes. Recommendations on a stock can only
change once a month. If a stock is not rated a sell, then it is
rated a buy.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. As a new subscriber, should I buy all the
stocks in my chosen portfolio, or should I go with only the new buys?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Either strategy if fine. The aggressive
option is to go ahead and buy all stocks in your selected model
portfolio at their current prices. This way you'll be fully
invested instantly. Even though some of these stocks may be up
100-200% since we bought them, it doesn't mean that they cannot
go up another 100% or more from these levels. The more conservative
option is to buy only those stocks that have a new buy
recommendation for that month and leave the rest of your
portfolio in cash. This way, it'll take you a few months to get
fully invested. Just make sure that you divide your portfolio in the
right proportion. For example, if you are following the $75000
model portfolio and there are 3 new buys this month, then you
will buy $5000 worth of each of these stocks (total $15000) and leave
the rest of the $60000 in cash.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Why are you recommending or buying XYZ
stock?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. The answer to a question like this is always
the same -- &quot;because our computer models rank it as an
excellent buy at this time&quot;.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. How do I use the list of top 100 stocks
ranked in order of attractiveness based on relative strength?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. If you decide <u>not</u> to follow one of
our model portfolios, you may use the list of 100 most attractive stocks
to pick and choose and build your own personal portfolio. <u>One</u>
strategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of that
list. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 100. When a stock
drops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top of the
list. This is just <u>one way</u> of using the list. You may
prefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit your personal
taste.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. A stock does not appear in the list of
top 100. Why are you are still holding it in the model portfolio?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. We do not necessarily sell a stock in the
model portfolio when it falls out of the top 100. Our sell discipline
is such that we only sell a stock when it falls into the lower
half of our rankings. Remember, the ranking provided in the newsletter
is only a partial listing of approximately 400 stocks we rank. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. The 1, 3, 6 and 12 month % change in the
list of top 100 stocks is projected or actual?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. That is the actual % change for each stock
in the last 21, 63, 126 and 252 trading days.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. I expect the market to have a correction.
Should I sell my stocks?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Since we are not trying to time the market
and have a long-term time horizon (5 years or more), we intend to
remain fully invested at all times. The stocks in our rankings
and model portfolios are very strong both fundamentally and technically.
Even if they do go down with the general market, they are also
likely to rebound faster.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. What other services do you provide?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. We provide newsletter services with the <i>Growth
Stocks Report</i> and <i>Mutual Fund Bulletin (MFB)</i>. The <i>MFB</i> seeks
to provide magnificent market timing to dramatically reduce risk
while earning spectacular returns with mutual funds. Our sister
companies, <i>Select Sector Research Management (SSRM)</i> and <i>Saxena
Capital Management (SCM),</i> offer professional money management
services. <i>SSRM</i> manages individual commodities accounts and <i>SCM</i> manages
a hedge fund called the Index Timing Fund, LP. Please call if you
have an interest in any of the above services.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Can I call you with questions?</b></font> </p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="3"><i>We are not in a position to give
        individualized investment advice.</i> Everything you need
        to know is contained in the newsletter. The purpose of
        the newsletter is tell you what to buy, when to buy and
        when to sell. The newsletter subscription price does not
        include telephone consultation. We would like to spend
        our time researching new investment opportunities rather than
        answering questions that pertain to just one individual.
        You should consult a financial planner for your specific
        needs. However, if you have a question of a general
        nature that other people may also be interested in,
        please write or fax it to us and we will try to answer it
        in subsequent issues of the newsletter.</font> </li>

<p align="center"><font size="6"><b>How to Use the </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0080" size="7"><em><b>Hot Funds
Analyst</b></em></font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="jazzy.gif"></p>

<p><font size="6"><strong>D</strong></font>on't be fooled by the
elegant simplicity of the Hot Funds Analyst. As you can see, it
is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it generates enormous
profits when followed correctly and with proper discipline.<br>
</p>

<p>Our research and computer analysis are designed to select and
choose mutual funds for at least a four-week period. Our system
is not designed to trade intra-week or inter-day. Remember, all
the funds on our Top 50 list are technically very strong. We
don't sell a fund based solely on a few good or bad days of
trading. <br>
</p>

<p>However, we will send you a <i><u>SPECIAL FLASH UPDATE</u></i>
anytime our Best intermediate Term Timing System (BITS) signals a
major change in stock market direction.<br>
</p>

<p>We also have a telephone hotline that is updated <i>every
Monday by 9:00 am eastern time</i>. This hotline will give you the
current position of BITS and any portfolio changes.<br>
</p>

<p>The Hot Funds Analyst features 4 Model Portfolios. The <i>first
portfolio</i> uses the Rydex Family Of Funds (1-800-820-0888) in
conjunction with our BITS market timing system. This is known as
our INDEX FUNDS PORTFOLIO. By using these funds (Nova, OTC and
Ursa) we can go both long and short depending on the signal from
the market timing system. Rydex Nova is an S&amp;P500 index fund.
Rydex OTC is a NASDAQ index fund. Rydex Ursa is an index fund
that is short the S&amp;P500.<br>
</p>

<p>BITS was developed in late 1988 and was tested on historical
data from 1963 to 1988. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P500 index were
used to generate the buy/sell signals and compute the returns. Since 1989,
BITS has been in use real-time and it has proven itself in both
backtesting and actual trading. On average it signals a trade
every 4 months. The accuracy rating is over 80%, with every 4 out
of 5 winning trades. The compounded annualized return is over 24%
per year.<br>
</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why we are using the Rydex
family of funds for trading BITS signals. <u>Rydex Nova</u> is an S&amp;P500
index fund with a beta of 1.5. This means when BITS is correct in
its long signal, you make 50% <i>more</i> than the S&amp;P500
index itself. <u>Rydex OTC</u> is the an index fund that tracks the
Nasdaq index. The combination of Rydex Nova and OTC lets us
participate in both the large and the small-cap stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>Rydex is the only family that offers a fund that is short the
S&amp;P500. This makes <u>Rydex Ursa</u> a rather unique fund. It goes
up when the S&amp;P500 goes down and vice-versa. This means when BITS
is correct in its cash/short signal you can make money as the
S&amp;P goes down. If you are able to find other similar funds,
you may be able to substitute them for the Rydex funds. Jack
White &amp; Company (1-800-233-3411) offers all three Rydex funds
while Charles Schwab offers only the Nova fund.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>second portfolio</i> consists of no-load funds that can
be bought and sold through Charles Schwab (1-800-2-NO-LOAD) or
Jack White (1-800-233-3411). This is known as our NO-LOAD FUNDS PORTFOLIO and
it consists of funds from excellent families like Twentieth Century,
Janus, Invesco, Berger, Oakmark, Strong, Steinroe, Founders,
Montgomery, Lexington, Cappiello-Rushmore, IAI, Dreyfus, Kaufmann
and many others. These funds are also available through the
Fidelity Funds Network (1-800-544-7777).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>third portfolio</i> is called the FIDELITY GROWTH
PORTFOLIO and it consists of 4 <i>diversified</i> Fidelity funds. The <i>fourth
portfolio</i> is called the FIDELITY SECTOR PORTFOLIO and it
consists of 4 Fidelity Select <i>sector</i> funds. Fidelity
Select funds have a <i><u>one time</u></i> 3% sales load. After
that you may switch to other funds within the family without any
loads. There is also a $7.50 redemption charge which can be
avoided by using their automated telephone touch-tone trading
system. Fidelity can be reached at 1-800-544-8888.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>How To Get Started<br>
<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><b>1. Choose One Or More Model Portfolios</b> </p>

<p><b>2. Invest In Those Mutual Funds That Have A </b><b><u>Buy</u></b><b>
Rating.</b> </p>

<p><b>3. Sell When A </b><b><u>Sell</u></b><b> Signal Is Given<br>
<br>
</b></p>

<p>Once you have decided on a portfolio to follow, you can decide
what to buy. For each portfolio, an allocation percentage is
listed next to each fund. Use this allocation to decide how many
shares to buy depending on your <i>personal</i> portfolio/account
size. Every portfolio gives you a specific percentage for each
mutual fund. <u>Just multiply this percentage by the total amount
of money you have to invest. This way any size investment can be
accommodated.<br>
</u></p>

<p>You'll then see the individual funds in every issue of the Hot
Funds Analyst. You simply invest in the mutual funds that are in
your selected portfolio. Whenever there is a change, just call
your broker or mutual fund and ask them to switch your money to
the recommended fund. By keeping your money in a winning fund,
you automatically win.<br>
</p>

<p>When you get the next issue of the Hot Funds Analyst, check
your selected model portfolio and look at the <u>Status</u> of your
fund. Sell your fund when a sell signal is given. Then purchase
the new recommendation. It is as simple as that.<br>
</p>

<p>Please remember ... <i><u>patience and discipline</u></i> are
the two most important cornerstones of successful investing.
Don't expect miracles or think you'll get rich overnight. Also,
don't let the day to day market volatility and ups and downs bother
you. That is all part of investing in the stock market. <u>Focus
on the longer-term. Look at the bigger picture. Think where you
want to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now.<br>
</u></p>

<p>Jumping around from one investment program to the next can be
detrimental to your wealth building efforts. Once you have found
a good system, like the Hot Funds Analyst, try it for at least
2-3 years before passing judgment on it.<br>
</p>

<p>We at the Hot Funds Analyst hope to make your investing
profitable and enjoyable. </p>

<p>If you followed my recommendation in the past few months and
invested $10,000 in each of the above 5 stocks, <font
color="#008000"><b>you'd have over $262,335 today</b>,</font> a
whopping 424.67% profit. Better yet, if you join our exclusive
group of readers, you can reap similar gains in outstanding
growth stocks which 99% of investors have never even heard about.<br>

<p>In this letter, I'll show you how you can use my <font

the last eight years with remarkable success.<br>

<p>You're invited to learn about the growth stock newsletter that
turned a $25,000 investment into $73,857, a gain of 195.43%, in

<p>In 1995, my <font color="#008000"><b>Growth Stocks Report</b></font>
model portfolios were up a whopping <font color="#008000"><b>143.73%.</b></font>
So far in 8 months of 1996, even after the sharp mid-year
correction, they are up another <font color="#008000"><b>21.17%.<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>If you'd invested $10,000 in Accustaff (ASTF) in November 95,
as I advised, you'd have turned your initial investment into
$42,510. <br>
</p>

<p>Your $10,000 investment in US Robotics (USRX), which I picked
in January last year, would have turned into $60,594 by July 96. <br>
</p>

<p>And in just 17 months, a $10,000 investment in Ascend
Communications (ASND) would have put $91,762 in your pocket.<br>
</p>

<p>How have I been able to do this, particularly when most
advisors and mutual funds are having such a tough time just keeping
up with the broad market averages like the S&amp;P 500 and the
Nasdaq. <br>
</p>

<p>And how can I make my systems yield <u>speedy, significant
growth</u> of your capital? Let me tell you... </p>

<p>In a moment, I am going to reveal a remarkable, time-tested,
system I've developed that will : </p>

<ul>
    <li>Keep you invested at all times in the best performing
        Growth Stocks. </li>
    <li>Give you the discipline to stay invested for double,
        triple digit profits. </li>
    <li>Let your profits keep running, while immediately cutting
        your losses. </li>
    <li>Signal when to sell your weaker stocks and replace them
        with the strongest. </li>
    <li>Make your stock investing easier and more successful than
        you ever imagined possible. <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p>How successful? Here are some of my most recent winning
recommendations : </p>

INVESTMENT ADVISORS</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b><u>DON'T</u></b><b>
MAKE YOUR MONEY GROW FAST ENOUGH<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>My name is <i>Jay Saxena,</i> and I, like you, enjoy making
money. I mean big money. Not 10 or 20 %. But 50% or more - and I
can help you achieve this goal, too.<br>
</p>

<p>Ever since I first became fascinated with the stock market,
I've made it a habit to study every conceivable method for picking
winning stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>Like most new investors, when I first got interested in trying
to increase my wealth, I looked at the results professional advisors
and newsletters were getting with their stock and mutual funds portfolios.<br>
</p>

<p>You've probably done much the same thing I did. I checked out
virtually all the stock investment newsletters. Zweig and The
Moneyletter. Value Line, The Chartist, Standard &amp; Poors.
Dozens and dozens of them.<br>
</p>

<p>I wasn't impressed. The vast majority of them either lost
money or posted gains that didn't even keep up with inflation. That's
not the way to make money grow. If you want to achieve the good
life and the financial security that lets you do what you want to
do, you've got to find a better way.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>THERE HAD TO BE A
BETTER METHOD</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>THAN WHAT THEY WERE
USING... <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>So, being an engineer by training (I have a Master's Degree in
Computer Science), and having an analytical mind, I thought I
could do better on my own. And I was sure I could improve upon
what were then state-of-the-art computer trading systems.<br>
</p>

<p>So I started developing a stock selection methodology that
would find the stocks with the highest probability of explosive
gains in the shortest time. </p>

<p>And I very quickly realized that the blue-chip stocks like
Xerox, GM, GE, IBM and AT&amp;T were not going to put me -- or
you, or anyone else -- on the fast track to wealth.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">The really big gains that can <u>turn
your small investment capital into a large fortune</u> come from
the small cap growth stocks.<br>
</font></p>

<p>So that's where I concentrated my efforts. And they've paid
off handsomely. In fact, in 1995-96 the average gain of the 6
stock model portfolios featured in our Growth Stocks Report is an
astounding 262.82%.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>WHY SHOULD YOU INVEST
IN</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>SMALL COMPANY GROWTH
STOCKS <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Quite simply, you should invest in small company growth stocks
because they are hands down <font color="#008000"><i>the most
successful investment category in the 20th century.</i></font>
They offer an excellent way to grow a portfolio faster than more
traditional methods.<br>
</p>

<p>In 1940 , $1000 invested in the stocks of the large-cap stocks
of the S&amp;P500 would have turned into about $330,300 by 1991,
with all interest and dividends reinvested. But the same $1,000
put into small company stocks would have netted a total of <font
color="#008000"><i>$1,965,000.</i></font> That is almost <font
color="#008000"><i>6 times</i></font> better than the S&amp;P500.<br>
</p>

<p>These figures are based on investing in <i>all</i> publicly
traded small firms listed on the exchanges or the over-the-counter market.
If you had carefully researched the <i>most</i> promising small
companies and placed your capital only with them, you would
almost certainly have done even better -- a great deal better.<br>
</p>

<p>In my newsletter, the Growth Stocks Report<font
color="#008000">,</font> I will share my expertise with you on
the growth stocks market and show you how to best profit from it.
With this newsletter, you can set yourself apart from the
majority of other investors, and your willingness to walk a
different path can result in much greater gains.<br>
</p>

<p>You're probably also going to have a more interesting,
exciting, and involving time than you would with a portfolio composed
only of blue chips, bonds, and mutual funds.<br>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>4 POWERFUL REASONS :
THE FACTS VS. MYTHS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Here are 4 powerful reasons why small cap stocks are such big
winners... </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>1. SIZE!<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>&quot;Small cap&quot; companies are those with low (usually
under $500 million) capitalization. They have only a limited
amount of common and preferred stock outstanding.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>And right there is the major reason why they have so much
potential to make explosive gains -- they're small.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">Let's face it: a company with $200
million in sales has a much better chance of doubling to $400 million
than a $2 billion company has of doubling to $4 billion in sales. <br>
</font></p>

<p>And a small cap stock priced at $10 a share can much more
easily go to $20 than a blue chip stock at $100 a share can go to
$200. <br>
</p>

<p>Hey -- just look at the recent performance of some of the
small cap stocks I've picked in my newsletter, the Growth Stocks
Report, and you can easily see this principle in action : </p>

<p>What are the chances of GE or AT&amp;T or other blue chips <font
color="#008000"><u>ever</u></font> showing gains like that?<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>2. SPEED!<br>
</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Small Cap Companies Can Move Fast!<br>
</u></b></p>

<p>Small cap companies are flexible, nimble. They represent the
best of the American entrepreneurial spirit. They find and quickly
exploit niches in the marketplace.<br>
</p>

<p>And they can shift directions fast to take advantage of new
opportunities, unlike some lumbering giant of a corporation filled
with bureaucrats and super-conservative accountants.<br>
</p>

<p>The best small companies have aggressive management and
motivated employee teams. They are hungry and quick to capitalize
on technological change. Quick to adapt to changing markets.
Quick to seize the day!<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">That means that if you're in the right
place -- where my stock selection system in the Growth Stocks Report
will put you - you can capture gains of 20%... 30%... 50%... even
100%-plus! in a very short time.<br>
</font></p>

<p>If we have periods of higher inflation, the share prices of
small stocks will rise much faster than blue chips. That means a $10
stock can quickly jump to $20, or even $50 in a matter of months.
That's the beauty of the small stocks. The best ones can hand you
a small fortune practically overnight.<br>
</p>

<p><b>But that's </b><b><u>not</u></b><b> all :</b> </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>3. EARNINGS!<br>
</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><u>These Stocks Are Earnings-Driven!<br>
</u></b></p>

<p>When you look at historical growth rates, you quickly see that
small cap companies' earnings rise much faster than larger
companies'. <br>
</p>

<p>Earnings of small cap companies with less than $500 million in
sales, in fact, typically grow 10 to 12 times faster than blue
chip stocks. Think about it -- there's not much room for the
likes of GM and IBM to grow, and they certainly can't grow
rapidly. On the other hand, there is plenty of room for small
companies to grow -- and they will grow rapidly!<br>
</p>

<p>According to <font color="#008000"><i>Ibbotson &amp;
Associates</i></font><i>,</i> a market research firm, the
smallest 10 percent of the NYSE stocks outperformed the largest
10 percent by more than 30 times over the past 67 years. And this translates
into explosive stock price increases. In fact, in 1993 the NASDAQ
composite of small cap growth stocks had better than 2 times the growth
rate of the DOW and S&amp;P 500 for that year!<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Plus, They've Got 1 More Advantage :<br>
<br>
</u></b></p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>4. GREAT LEVERAGE!<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>When a small cap company's earnings grow, the earnings-
per-share aren't diluted... and that makes the stock more attractive
and more valuable.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">Then the basic laws of supply and demand
take over: with a limited number of shares available, a relatively
small amount of stock purchased can quickly push up the price of
the rest.<br>
</font></p>

<p>Small-cap stocks provide you with true ground floor
opportunities. By now, I'm sure you understand why I look to the small
cap stocks to build my wealth -- and why they can build your wealth,
too! <br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>THE REVOLUTIONARY
ALPHA - RSM SYSTEM <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that my method uses a proprietary system
I've developed for identifying high-potential small cap stocks
that will yield explosive gains in a short time. Let me tell you
more about this...<br>
</p>

<p>I've already explained why I look to the small cap stocks for
my winners. Every week, my staff and I screen thousands of them,
looking for the handful that have the potential for spectacular
stock price increases. I want to invest only in the top 1% of all
growth stocks. To me, the other 99% are simply not acceptable. I
know from experience that only the top 1% will beat the market by
100% or more. That's where I want to put my money, and I imagine
you'd want to do the same.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>What are we looking for?</u></font>
Emerging companies poised for enormous growth. Or established
ones that are about to make major advances. We want companies
whose products are in such demand that they can't make them fast
enough. Ones with entrepreneurial leadership that is taking
advantage of technological breakthroughs to create new,
super-fast growing businesses.<br>
</p>

<p>And we want to find them <font color="#008000"><u>before</u></font>
they're discovered by the financial media and hordes of
investors. So we can buy them ahead of the pack and take full
advantage of the run-up in their stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>I employ a combination of fundamental and technical approaches
to investing and have a rigid risk management system to keep my
reward to risk ratio high. I determine my trading ideas based on fundamental
analysis and time my purchases using technical analysis to
recommend the most promising small-cap growth stocks that show
strong technical patterns and evidence of accumulation. <br>
</p>

<p>Some of the fundamental and technical characteristics I look
for are accelerating earnings, positive earnings surprises, accelerating
revenues, high relative strength, high relative industry
strength, a low PE relative to the projected earnings growth
rate, innovative products in a market that is rapidly expanding,
rising order backlogs, and expanding profit margins. I sell when
a stock breaks down technically or violates my screening rules.<br>
</p>

<p>Part of this stock selection process uses the <font
color="#008000">C-A-N-S-L-I-M</font> methodology developed by
William O'Neil, which has proven highly successful. We set very
strict risk/reward guidelines and whittle the possibilities down
to a handful of companies with superior balance sheets and
liquidity, and little or no debt.<br>
</p>

<p>Then we take this short list and subject it to a rigorous
proprietary system based on cutting-edge computerized technical analysis.
This incorporates <u>both fundamental and technical factors</u>
like :<br>
</p>

<p><b>Valuation Indicators</b> -- P/E Ratio, Relative P/E Ratio,
Projected P/E Ratio, Price/Book Value Ratio, Price/Cash Flow
Ratio, Price/Capital Spending Ratio, Price/Sales Ratio </p>

<p><b>Earnings Indicators</b> -- Earnings Per Share, Earnings
Growth Rate, Projected Earnings, Earnings Velocity, EPS Increase,
EPS Consistency, Return on Assets, Return on Equity </p>

<p><b>Debt Risk Indicators</b> -- Current Ratio, Debt/Equity
Ratio, Interest Coverage, Debt Service/EPS </p>

<p><b>Balance Sheet Indicators</b> -- Book Value Growth Rate,
Capital Spending Growth Rate, Cash/Price Ratio, Inventory Turnover,
Receivables Turnover, Asset Turnover </p>

<p><b>Volume Indicators</b> -- Volume/Share, 30-Day Average
Volume, Vol/30-Day Average Volume Ratio, 5-Day/30-Day Average
Volume Ratio, Short Interest </p>

<p><b>Performance Indicators</b> -- Relative Strength, Price
Growth Rates, Least Squares Deviation, EPS Rank, Price Rank, Group
Rank, Accumulation Distribution </p>

<p><b>Background Indicators</b> -- Number and Percentage of
Institutional Holdings, Number of Outstanding Shares, Market Capitalization,
Insider Trading and Exercise of Options </p>

<p><b>Technical Indicators</b> -- Moving Averages, MACD,
Momentum, Stochastics, Wilder's RSI, Daily Range, High/Low, Beta,
Volatility, McClellan Oscillator and many more </p>

<p><b>Forecasting Indicators</b> -- Next 5 Weeks, Next 4 Months,
Next 1 Year and Next 3 Year % Probability of Increase and % Gain <br>
</p>

<p>I realize that's a staggering number of factors to take into
account. It's only possible because of the advanced computer system
I've developed. <font color="#008000">The bottom line is that the <i>Alpha-RSM
System</i> works. <u>It works like crazy!</u></font> Here are a
few more examples of the gains this system has won :<br>

<p>Now, my approach may be simple, but making sure my recommended
stocks are truly the top 1% takes a great deal of work. But don't
let that scare you. If you take advantage of my service, my staff and
I will do all the hard work for you.<br>
</p>

<p>Your job will be to simply duplicate my model portfolio, or
make up your own custom portfolio from my TOP 100 list. I'll
provide guidelines on how to construct a balanced portfolio for
your objectives. But whichever stocks you choose, you can be sure
they're among the top 1% of all growth stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>Once you make the investments, you'll just sit tight until
it's time to take your profits. Each month I'll give you buy or
sell advice on every recommendation in our model portfolios. We
hold a stock anywhere from a few months to a couple of years.
Today's market is one of rapidly changing conditions, of
opportunities coming and going, of fortunes rising and falling in
a fast-paced, highly competitive global marketplace.<br>
</p>

<p>Today, a growth stock may do very well for a one, two, or
sometimes three years, but after a while its performance falls
off. That's when we take our profits and move on. The idea is to
own the best growth companies during their greatest growth
periods. </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>EIGHT UNIQUE BENEFITS
THAT CAN LEAD</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>YOU TO SPECTACULAR,
LONG-TERM PROFITS</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><u>WHY SHOULD YOU CONSIDER USING MY ALPHA-RSM
SYSTEM? <br>
</u></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll only invest in the
        strongest stocks</b>,</font> even in weak markets. My
        system screens thousands of stocks, rejecting most of
        them, even so-called popular stocks. I am really only interested
        in stocks that can bring 100%, 200%, 500%, even 1000%
        gains over the long term. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll be in an enviable
        position</b>,</font> letting your profits run on stocks
        with virtually unlimited growth potential<i>.</i> At the
        same time you will be able to ruthlessly eliminate the
        weaker stocks, immediately cutting your losses. By doing
        just these two things, you would rise far above the average
        investor, who typically does just the opposite. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll know exactly what to do</b></font>
        -- buy, hold or sell, and when to do it. No need to even worry
        about the stock market on a day-to-day basis. You can
        relax peacefully, comfortable with the fact that since
        your money is invested in the best possible stocks,
        you'll make money over the long term, regardless of what
        the market does. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll discover relatively
        unknown companies</b><i>,</i></font> with spectacular
        growth patterns. These are the kind of stocks that most
        people hear about only <i>after</i> they have gone up
        2000%. But you'll be able to get in early and reap
        substantial profits. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll have the revolutionary
        Alpha-RSM System on your side</b></font> -- by following recommendations generated
        by our breakthrough stock selection techniques, you'll be racking up
        profits in virtually any kind of market. Our system is
        able to find good stocks even in tough markets. For
        example, our portfolio was up almost 110% in 1994, when
        the S&amp;P500 gained barely 1.3% and the Nasdaq actually
        lost money. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll know exactly when to sell
        your stocks</b></font> -- This is one of the most
        critical things that some newsletters neglect. They tell
        you when to buy, but forget to tell you when to sell.
        While I firmly believe in a patient, disciplined approach
        to stock investing, I also believe in selling when it's
        time to sell. There's no place for emotion here. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll NOT be required to trade
        extensively</b></font> -- I believe that long-term
        investors make money for themselves while short-term
        traders just make money for their brokers. In fact, the Alpha-RSM
        System is so easy to use that you probably won't have to
        devote more than 15 minutes a month to your investments. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll have a choice of 6 model
        portfolios to help you properly diversify</b></font> your investment dollars.
        All you have to do is select the portfolio that's right
        for you and then each month just follow your lead, adding
        a few new stocks and selling those that have reached their
        peak. <br>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>IT'S TIME TO TAKE
CONTROL</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>OF YOUR INVESTMENTS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Regardless of your investment objectives, you've got to
include some of these stars in your portfolio. No other investments
will do nearly as well in the next few years. These super stocks
have all passed my rigorous analysis. They all have explosive
growth potential!<br>
</p>

<p>If you are retired, I suggest you allocate a portion of your
nest egg -- 20% or 25% -- to as many of these future blockbusters
as you can buy, since no other stocks will grow so quickly. That
could mean a much bigger nest egg for you in just a couple of
years.<br>
</p>

<p>If you are 5 years from retirement, using these stocks is the
best way to triple, and even quadruple, your nest egg in just this
short time. Imagine what a difference that can make for you. Of
course if you're 10, 15, 20, or even 25 years away from
retirement, you can't afford not to take advantage of these very
profitable small-cap growth stocks.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>You'll get the Growth Stocks Report
by FAX or E-mail on the first business day of every month.</u></font>
If you don't have a fax machine or Internet e-mail, you'll
receive your Growth Stocks Report by first class mail, usually by
the 7th of every month.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">You will also have 24-hour access to our
two telephone hotlines -- one is updated monthly for new buys and
sells while the other is updated weekly to bring you the latest
news about the stocks in our model portfolios.</font> These
numbers are changes periodically to prevent any unauthorized use.<br>
</p>

<p>Whether you take delivery by fax, e-mail or first class mail,
you'll discover the Growth Stocks Report gives you greater control
over your profits.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>SMALL RISE IN SHARE
PRICE</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>EQUALS HUGE GAIN<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>This is your chance to dramatically increase your wealth in a
very short period of time. Again, that's the beauty of small stocks
-- the share price can climb dramatically, so fast. Remember, a
$5 jump on a $10 stock can give you a much higher percentage gain
than a $5 increase on a $100 stock.<br>
</p>

<p>Let's see how this works. If you buy a stock selling at $10,
and it climbs $5, to $15 a share, you have a 50% gain. But the
same $5 upmove in a stock selling at $100 is just a 5% gain. And
of course for the same investment, you can buy a lot more shares
of the $10 stock than you can of a $100 stock.<br>
</p>

<p>If you invest $5,000 in a stock selling at $10, you can buy
500 shares. Then if the share price climbs $5, your profit is $2500
(5 x 500 = 2500). That's a 50% gain on your original investment. <br>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you invest $5,000 in a stock selling at
$100, you can buy just 50 shares. Here, a $5 gain gives a profit
of just $250 (5 x 50 = 250).<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>SAFETY FIRST -- GO
WITH QUALITY <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>You don't have to be a mathematical genius to see the enormous
advantage in small stocks. That's why I am so excited. For the
next several years, these explosive investments will post the
biggest gains!<br>
</p>

<p>But again, you have to know which ones to buy. Not every small
stock is going to do well. In fact, most of them aren't worth
your trouble. I can't stress this point too much. To achieve both
high gains and safety, you must invest only in the highest-quality
small stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>The problem is, you can't get timely and reliable information
on quality small-cap growth stocks. And yet, without such information,
you will not know which growth stocks to buy, nor when to sell them
for the highest profit. <font color="#008000"><b>You need The Growth

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="6" face="Flexure"><b>HOT
STOCKS DIGEST</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="6"><b><img
src="jazzy.gif"></b></font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><i>Dear Valued Subscriber,</i></p>

<p>Welcome to the <b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b>. Let me
congratulate you on your wise decision to become a charter
subscriber. Don't be fooled by the elegant simplicity of the <font
color="#FF0000"><b><i>Hot Stocks Digest.</i></b></font> As you
can see, it is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it generates
enormous profits when followed correctly and with proper
discipline. </p>

<p>Our <font color="#FF0000"><i><u>Alpha-RSM System</u></i></font>
incorporates the <font color="#FF0000">C-A-N-S-L-I-M</font>
approach developed by William O'Neil. It is designed to ferret
out those stocks that have a high alpha as well as high relative
strength &amp; momentum. Alpha is that measure of the return that
is not explained by the general market. For example, if the
S&amp;P500 has an average monthly return of 1.5% and a stock has
an average monthly return of 8.5%, then the stock has an alpha of
7%. This 7% is the excess return that the stock generates over
the general market.<br>
</p>

<p>Once we have selected our list of 500+ <i><u>high alpha stocks</u></i>,
we run them through our proprietary mathematical models that rank
them based on their relative strength and momentum. We want to
buy only those high alpha stocks that also have high relative
strength and are going up at the present time. We have no
interest in stocks that are going sideways, or worse, are going
down.<br>
</p>

<p>The <font color="#FF0000"><b>&quot;200 Most Attractive Hot
Stocks&quot;</b></font> are then presented in each issue of the <font
color="#FF0000"><b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b></font><b><i>.</i></b>
Their percent change over the past 21 and 50 days is also shown.
Since we are not day traders or very short-term traders, the 21
and 50 day % change and the 21 and 50 day moving average numbers
give us a better feel for each stock. Intermediate-term trades
usually last from 2 weeks to 6 months. For these kind of trades,
the 50 day moving average serves as an excellent support level.
If it is penetrated and the stock decisively closes below it, the
stock becomes an outright sell. <br>
</p>

<p>Our $100,000 model portfolio can have between 0 and 30 stocks.
The allocation in the portfolio is dependent upon prevailing
market conditions and the buy/sell signals from our market timing
and asset allocation models. A 50% invested position will have 10
stocks and a 150% invested position (using margin) will have 30
stocks. That is the maximum leverage we'll be using in this
portfolio. <br>
</p>

<p>You can also use the list of the 200 most attractive hot
stocks to pick and choose and build your own personal portfolio. <i><u>One</u></i>
strategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of that
list. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 200. When a stock
drops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top of
the list.<br>
</p>

<p>This is just one way of using the list. You may prefer to use
it differently and tailor it to suit your personal taste. <u>Another
way to use the list is to buy any stock that makes it to the top
20</u>. To make room in your portfolio, you may have to sell some
stocks. We recommend you sell the lowest ranked stocks and buy
the top ranked ones. This way you will be rotating out of weaker
stocks into stronger ones.<br>
</p>

<p>As a new subscriber you have two options when you start
building your portfolio. The aggressive option is to go ahead and
buy all stocks in the model portfolio. This way you'll be fully
invested instantly. Even though some of these stocks may be up
50-100%, it doesn't mean that they cannot go up another 100% or
more from these levels. The conservative option is to buy only
the new stocks added to the portfolio each week and leave the
rest of your portfolio in cash. This way, it'll take you a few
months to become fully invested.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">You'll get the <b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b>
every Sunday via fax, e-mail or on our internet world wide web
site.</font> When you start trading using our recommendations,
you'll discover the <font color="#000000"><b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b></font>
gives you greater control over your profits. And triple-digit
gains are NOT rare! Time and time again, I've selected stocks
that have realized over-100% gains in just a few short months <br>
</p>

<p>You don't have to be a mathematical genius to see the enormous
advantage in small stocks. That's why I am so excited. For the
next several years, these <font color="#FF0000"><i>explosive</i></font>
investments will post the biggest gains! But again, you have to
know which ones to buy. Not every small stock is going to do
well. In fact, most of them aren't worth your trouble. I can't
stress this point too much. To achieve both high gains and
safety, you must invest only in the highest-quality small stocks.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>SET REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Can we expect 100% plus returns every year. It would be great,
but it just isn't realistic. In fact 100% returns happen once
only 4 or 5 years. We don't know when that is going to happen.
That is why we need to fully invested in the best high-alpha,
high-RSM growth stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>Many investors, particularly those with less than 5 years
experience with their own money in the market, have
unrealistically high expectations regarding returns. This is
perhaps the biggest source of frustration for newer investors.<br>
</p>

<p>Over a 10-year period, stocks will be up only about 65 percent
of the time on average. The rest of the days are spent drifting
sideways or falling. These negative periods can last months or
even years. The good news is that our <font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Alpha-RSM
System</i></b></font> can find the best stocks even when the
general stock is going down.<br>
</p>

<p>Successful investing requires a mental determination and
emotional commitment to stay invested for at least one market
cycle, which usually lasts four to six years.<br>
</p>

<p>Often investors lack the stamina to hold out through high
period of volatility. They bail out, usually at the worst
possible moment, forgetting that the extraordinary returns
generated by small-cap stocks will eventually compensate them for
the risk or volatility. <br>
</p>

<p>Please remember ... <font color="#FF0000"><i>patience and
discipline</i></font> are the two most important cornerstones of
successful investing. Don't expect miracles or think you'll get
rich overnight. Also, don't let the day to day market volatility
and ups and downs bother you. That is all part of investing in
the stock market. Focus on the longer-term. Look at the bigger
picture. Think where you want to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now.<br>
</p>

<p>Generally, the longer you can leave your money in the market,
the more risk you should be willing to take. You also need a
proven investment strategy. Without a plan, investors often jump
from one idea or philosophy to another.<br>
</p>

<p>Jumping around from one investment program to the next can be
detrimental to your wealth building efforts. Once you have found
a good system, like the <font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Hot Stocks
Digest</i></b></font>, try it for at least 12-18 months before
passing judgment on it. <br>
</p>

<p>Don't expect to make money each and every week. When faced
with the inevitable down periods, don't lose patience and throw
in the towel. Hang in there. Wait for the right opportunities,
because sooner or later, they will surely come. We at <b><i>Hot
Stocks Digest</i></b> hope to make your investing profitable and
enjoyable. <br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><b>Q. When is the newsletter published?</b> </p>

<p>A. The <b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b> is published every
Sunday and is available on our web site by 6:00 p.m. eastern
time. The fax is usually sent around the same time. The prices in
the newsletter are as of the last business day of the previous
week, usually a Friday.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Is there a telephone hotline?</b> </p>

<p>A. No. Since this is exclusively an on-line and fax
newsletter, there is no telephone hotline.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Do I buy at the market or at the price listed in the
newsletter?</b> </p>

<p>A. When you get the newsletter and decide to buy a stock, just
buy it at the market or at the bid price. In some cases you will
get a worse fill than the price listed in the newsletter and in
other cases you will get a better fill. Over time, your fills
should average out.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. How do I use the list of top 200 stocks ranked in order
of attractiveness based on relative strength?</b> </p>

<p>A. You may use the list of 200 most attractive stocks to pick
and choose and build your own personal portfolio. <u>One</u>
strategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of that
list. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 200. When a stock
drops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top of
the list. This is just <u>one way</u> of using the list. You may
prefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit your personal
taste. </p>

<p>Another way to use the list is to buy any stock that makes it
to the top 20. To make room in your portfolio, you may have to
sell some stocks. We recommend you sell the lowest ranked stocks
and buy the top ranked ones. This way you will be rotating out of
weaker stocks into stronger ones.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. How do you select stocks?</b> </p>

<p>A. Our stock selection process incorporates both fundamental
and technical criteria. Every month, we screen thousands of
stocks looking for the handful that have the potential for
spectacular stock price increases. We are we looking for emerging
companies poised for enormous growth or established ones that are
about to make major advances. We want companies whose products
are in such demand that they can't make them fast enough. Ones
with entrepreneurial leadership that is taking advantage of
technological breakthroughs to create new, super-fast growing
businesses. And we want to find them before they're discovered by
the financial media and hordes of investors. So we can buy them
ahead of the pack and take full advantage of the run-up in their
stocks. We set very strict risk/reward guidelines and whittle the
possibilities down to a handful of companies with superior
balance sheets and liquidity and little or no debt. Then we take
this short list and subject it to a rigorous proprietary system
based on cutting-edge computerized technical analysis. This
system ranks the stocks according to their short-term momentum
and relative strength. We list the top 200 in every issue of the <b><i>Hot
Stocks Digest</i></b>.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Are these stocks risky?</b> </p>

<p>A. On an individual stock basis, these small-cap stocks are
quite volatile and most people would characterize them as being
very risky. That is why you must diversify over at least 15-20
stocks, preferably more. If you have 15 stocks in your portfolio
and if four of them lose 25% each, your total portfolio loss is
only 6.66%. Furthermore, its quite possible that some of the
other stocks in the portfolio will go up thereby making up for
the small loss. <i><u>That is why it is imperative that you
diversify your holdings over a number a stocks.<br>
</u></i></p>

<p><b>Q. My stock is up 250%. Should I sell?</b> </p>

<p>A. That depends on your sell strategy. We, however, believe in
letting our profits run while cutting our losses short.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. A certain stock is down 4 points. Are you still
recommending it?</b> </p>

<p>A. Yes. Recommendations on a stock can only change once a
week. If a stock is still in the top 25, then it is rated a buy.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. As a new subscriber, should I get fully invested
immediately or should I invest gradually?</b> </p>

<p>A. Either strategy if fine. The aggressive option is to go
ahead and buy all stocks in the model portfolio. This way you'll
be fully invested instantly. Even though some of these stocks may
be up 50-100%, it doesn't mean that they cannot go up another
100% or more from these levels. </p>

<p>The more conservative option is to buy only the new stock buys
added each week and leave the rest of your portfolio in cash.
This way, it'll take you a few weeks to get fully invested. Just
make sure that you divide your portfolio in the right proportion.
For example, if you have $75000 to invest and you buy 5 new
stocks this month, then you will buy $5000 worth of each of these
stocks (total $25000) and leave the rest of the $50000 in cash.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Why are you recommending or buying XYZ stock?</b> </p>

<p>A. The answer to a question like this is always the same --
&quot;because our computer models rank it as an excellent buy at
this time&quot;. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. The 21 and 50 day % change in the list of top 200 stocks
is projected or actual?</b> </p>

<p>A. That is the actual % change for each stock in the last 21
and 50 trading days.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. I expect the market to have a correction. Should I sell
my stocks?</b> </p>

<p>A. Since we are not trying to time the market and have a
long-term time horizon (5 years or more), we intend to remain
fully invested at all times. The stocks in our rankings are very
strong both fundamentally and technically. Even if they do go
down with the general market, they are also likely to rebound
faster.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Can I call you with questions?</b> </p>

<p>A. <i>We are not in a position to give individualized
investment advice.</i> Everything you need to know is contained
in the newsletter. The purpose of the newsletter is show the best
of the best growth stocks in America today. The newsletter
subscription price does not include telephone consultation. We
would like to spend our time researching new investment
opportunities rather than answering questions that pertain to

nature that other people may also be interested in, please e-mail
it to us and we will try to answer it in subsequent issues of the
