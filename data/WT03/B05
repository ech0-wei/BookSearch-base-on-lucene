Governments Have Lost Control of International Trade

International trade is growing twice as fast as most
countries domestic GNP. Eastern Europe is rapidly moving
toward a market economy. Communications networks are the
railroads of the future; allowing value-added transactions to
move across borders unmeasured, and unrecorded.

Commerce Secretary Mosbacher has initiated a major policy
change to reduce the disincentives to export, created by an
export control policy which is out of touch with commercial
reality.  It is not a criticism that the change will be too
little too late, but the commercial reality is that the
European firms investing in Eastern Europe are not going to
compete in the marketplace with one hand tied behind their
back because of outdated concepts of export and technology
transfer controls.  Nor are they going to wait around for the
US government to give them permission.

Unless something changes Eastern Europe's direction (like
tanks in Tiananmen Square), economic activity will increase.
Eastern European countries are restricting exports of
subsidized consumer goods because it pays for an individual
to drive across a border to sell the goods for hard currency.
Small frequent export transactions are taking place because
human capital is available, even if financial capital is in
short supply.

To illustrate the amazing pace of change in Eastern Europe,
please note the following message from the new leadership in
East Germany (as quoted in a recent article by Craig Whitney
of the New York Times).  According to Mr. Gregory Gysi, the
new head of the East German Communist Party:

"I have never been in America in my life, but I think it is a
country that should not give up its responsibility for
Europe.  If the continued independence of the German
Democratic Republic is in the interests of stability in
Europe, then you should think about whether you want to leave
help for the G.D.R. up to a single neighbor country, and
thereby create dependency, or whether it wouldn't be better
to share the responsibility, to prevent the re-emergence of
Greater Germany,"

Referring to the possibility of unification, he added: "But
if so, then it should happen quickly-and simply."

Last June, 80 Socialist parties from around the world voted
in conference to reject socialism and adopt a system based on
market forces.  And barely six months later, the head of the
East German Communist party calls on the US to help complete
the post war process. The appeal of Eastern Europe is that
they want to buy what we have to sell, and despite a shortage
of hard currency they will take the necessary steps,
including mass emigration to obtain it.

Correction: The SED filing minimum will go to $2,500 when the
final rule is published in the Federal Register.

Our early information that the process of comments was
expected to be complete by January 1 was incorrect. Look for
a final rule with implementation at the earliest April
1st.  In the meantime, all export shipments where one
Schedule B number has a value greater than $1,500 requires
the filing of a completed Shipper's Export Declaration.

Housekeeping: Federal Register Notices usually appearing
monthly will reappear next month. "More than You Ever Wanted
to Know About Letters of Credit" is also scheduled to
reappear next month.

Europe 1992: Direction

Advisory Committee Report

The following is an abstract of the executive summary of the
Europe 1992 report of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy
and Negotiations (ACTPN).

Executive Summary

The European Community's program to create a single,
integrated market by the end of 1992 promises substantial
benefits to U.S. companies.  The program also presents
important challenges to the international trading system
whose current rules do not adequately address the intensely
competitive conditions of global markets.  The U.S.
government and the private sector have an interest in meeting
these challenges by seeking solutions to issues that now
serve to increase bilateral trade tensions.

The Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations
(ACTPN) has identified six such issues in which the U.S. has
a significant interest in influencing the direction of
change.  The ACTPN has also recommended actions the U.S.
government and the private sector need to take to address
current bilateral concerns.  In brief, the issues and
recommendations are:

Rules of Origin-The U.S. government needs to continue to
apply pressure on the EC to provide greater transparency,
clarity, and predictability in Community rule-making and
administration; to eliminate the use of local content in
settlements of antidumping charges; and to support the U.S.
goal within the Uruguay Round to reach a multilateral
discipline governing the rules of origin.

The private sector needs to build support among U.S.
companies for a harmonized system for determining origin; and
to establish a dialogue with companies in Europe aimed at
reducing the mutual reliance on trade law to restrict market
access.

Public Procurement-The U.S. government needs to press the EC
to extend fully competitive procedures for suppliers of non-
EC products; to seek time limits and conditions under which a
Member State may use "industrial adaptation" to postpone
market-opening changes; to allocate additional resources to
the GATT government procurement negotiations on the excluded
sectors; and to use the renegotiation of bilateral defense
agreements with the EC as leverage to achieve access to the
Community's largest areas of government procurement.

The private sector needs to press for the formulation and
acceptance of an effective remedies proposal providing
protection for injured suppliers; and to seek to influence
the ways in which procuring entities in Europe apply the 50%
value-added requirement and establish criteria for qualifying
and selecting suppliers, for evaluating bids, and for using
standards other than European standards.

Product Standards, Testing and Certification-The U.S.
government needs to formalize ad clarify recent agreements
reached with the European standards-setting organizations to
provide effective access for U.S. companies; to support the
commitment made by the EC that it will adopt international
standards wherever possible, rather than developing
specifically European standards; and to press for workable
structures in the EC and in the U.S. that will facilitate the
mutual recognition of test data and certification procedures.

The private sector needs to establish communications with
European subsidiaries, partners, distributors and customers
to keep abreast of standards-related developments in the
Community; and to participate more actively in the
international standards-setting process.

Technology Transfer-The U.S. government needs to assign the
highest priority to streamlining the list of multilaterally-
controlled products and technologies; to adopt standards for
resolving domestic jurisdictional disputes over the control
of goods and technology having both military and commercial
applications; to press the EC to indicate how it will ensure
a common standard of enforcement among the twelve Member
States; and to undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.
foreign policy controls to identify areas of unnecessary
duplication and inconsistency that encourage foreign firms to
design-out U.S. products and technology.

The private sector needs to provide advice to the U.S.
government on streamlining the control list; and to support
efforts to redirect current U.S. export control policy to
address changing technologies and East-West relations.

Local Content-The U.S. government needs to consult with the
EC and the Member States to ensure that the recently enacted
broadcasting directive is implemented in a flexible, non-
binding way.

The private sector needs to monitor developments in the
Member States, and to support the European groups opposed to
the introduction or strengthening of existing national
quotas.

Reciprocity-The U.S. government needs to continue its strong
support for the compromise language contained in the proposed
Second Banking Directive; and to monitor the EC's progress in
making similar changes in the draft directives on insurance
and investment services.

The report was adopted unanimously by ACTPN and represents
the consensus view of a broad spectrum of U.S.  industry and
labor.  It was submitted to Carla A. Hills, U.S.  Trade
Representative by James D.  Robinson III, ACTPN Chairman, and
Chairman and CEO of American Express Company; and Lawrence A.
Bosidy, Chairman of the ACTPN Task Force, and Vice Chairman
of the Board General Electric Company.

Relaxing Export Controls

A New Mosbacher Initiative

Commerce Secretary Mosbacher has gone on record saying that
there will be a "signifigant shortening" of the list of
commercially controlled items before the next Cocom meeting
in April. In an interview on the American Interests
televison show, Mr. Mosbacher said that "...we need to finish
our review, internally, in the US, get our groups together,
and see where we stand, going into Cocom together."

It has been observed that the other members of Cocom usually
follow the US lead in relaxing Cocom controls. It should be
remembered that last spring the official policy of Cocom was
announced as higher walls around fewer products. The delay
in implementing this policy position seems to come from a
dispute over which should come first, the higher walls or
fewer products.

The difference this year is the potential reunification of
Germany.

Following a meeting with his counterparts from East Germany,
Mr. Helmut Haussmann, the West German Economics Minister,
called for a relaxation of rules on East-West transfer of
technology to help give trade and industry cooperation
between East and West Germany "new perspectives". While this
may appear to be simply a German question, it raises the
issue of the viability of Cocom itself under the radical
restructuring of Eastern Europe.

Following the discussions, both East and West Germans were
reportedly satisfied with the talks which covered areas of
greater cooperation in medical technology, electronic control
systems, energy, and environmental technology. David Marsh
writing from East Berlin in the Financial Times said that
"Legal changes are expected to be made by both countries by
next February to allow joint ventures and to protect West
German investments in East Germany." In response to questions
about Cocom controls Mr. Hausman said that some rules
affecting areas like telecommunications and machine tools are
"senseless".

The Cocom process relies upon each member country enforcing
the agreed upon rules within its own borders.  President Bush
has acknowledged that the US "should and will review" the
Cocom process. Secretary of State Baker has said that "we
should rationalize the system to the extent that things that
are to some extent (italics added- ed.) available off the
shelf should not be locked up."  Deputy Secretary of State
Eagleburger is reported to have said that some dual use
technologies will no longer require prior approval, and that
"we understand that CoCom has to change."

Change first requires policy agreement, then implementation.

Two industry supported groups, looking at the process of
change from different perspectives have identified
essentially the same priorities and problems. (See the
following two articles.) The problem has been identified, and
for the most part the solution has been identified.

Before exporters see an actual reduction in the need to
obtain an export license, three obstacles remain:

1.  The Defense Department has not yet announced its
position, and with the rapid changes taking place in the
whole structure of European defense it is not clear when they
will have a new policy position.

2.  Writing new regulations, creating new lists, implementing
change takes time both in initiating the change, and then
going through the interagency review process.  Remember that
the process of shortening the list was also last year's
priority.

3.  Congress is about to re-authorize the Export
Administration Act. The National Academy of Sciences is due
to present another report. That which does not get done by
June is likely to have Congressional input by September,
further delaying the actual publication of new rules in the
Federal Register.

The difference, this year, is Eastern Europe and Western
Europe's integration.  Viscount Etienne Davignon, former EC
Commissioner of Industry, and current head of the European
Roundtable of Industrialists recently pointed out that Cocom
was a "procedure" which is not legally binding. As events in
Europe become clear, however, the procedure should be made
simpler and should become the "joint responsibility legally
of the EC" to reassure the US that Europeans are complying
with export controls.  While an interesting solution, the
problem is that the EC and Efta are currently re-negotiating
their trading relationship in light of 1992; a process which
is seen as the model for the EEC and Eastern Europe to enjoy
trade relations without full political relations.

The final text of the 12/15/89 NATO meeting ministerial
communique states : "In this regard, we support the progress
of rationalising existing export controls through a co-
ordinated approach that allows greater support for reform in
the East, and for Western investment in those countries while
protecting our security interests."  US Secretary of State
Baker was the US representative at those talks.  Agriculture
Secretary Yeutter, returning from a fact finding mission to
Eastern Europe, said that a process of building a
distribution infrastructure was necessary before foreign
direct investment would reap its full benefits.

Commerce Secretary calls for case by case evaluation of
higher tech sales to Eastern Europe; Soviets on hold.

When asked about the proposed sale of five very high-powered
Control Data Computers for contolling nuclear power plants on
NBC News, "Meet the Press" Commerce Secretary Mosbacher said
that they will "have to look at each item on a case-by-case
basis."  On a follow up question, Mr. Mosbacher said "but let
me say that we released middle technology, and we're going to
look to see whether it should go any higher than that.
Eastern European countries, yes. Soviet Union, would have to
be very careful."

In terms of specific direction for high-tech exports,
Secretary Mosbacher said "I think we will, particularly with
the Eastern European countries starting with Poland and
Hungary, open the door for higher technology as long as our
national security is protected.  We're willing to do it with
them because they have told us that they will protect us and
give us the opportunity to review (on site-ed.) what they're
doing with the higher-tech items."

On a very practical note, one knowledgeable observer
commented that with all those East Germans walking back and
forth across the border to West Berlin every day, did anybody
really think that all the packages they were carrying were
being inspected?  Defense Department policy notwithstanding,
soldiers at the border are also writing policy.

1992 and Technology Transfer

Recommendations

Recommendations on U.S. technology transfer policy by the
Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN)
to the U.S. Trade Representative.

The removal of EC internal frontiers increases the pressure
on the U.S. to accelerate efforts within Cocom toward the
development of common standards for national export control
systems.  To accomplish this goal, the U.S. will first have
to reduce the range products and technologies it currently
restricts, and further curtail its efforts to control
reexports of U.S.-origin goods and technology from Member
States, whether for reasons of national security or foreign
policy.

The danger is that, if the U.S. does not move rapidly enough
and cannot find common ground through Cocom then European
tolerance for U.S. export control policy may diminish further
in the context of a large, integrated market.  Were this to
happen it would likely increase European reluctance to
incorporate U.S. components in defense and high technology
products and undercut the ability of U.S. companies to
conduct cooperative research.  U.S. companies might then be
encouraged to conduct their R&D and production in Europe in
order to participate in EC and global markets.  European
companies with U.S. subsidiaries would also be discouraged
from conducting R&D in the U.S.

Thus, export control policies intended to safeguard the U.S.
could serve to weaken its technological lead.

The ACTPN therefore recommends that the U.S. government:

Assign the highest priority to streamlining the Cocom control
list.  The list needs to include only those items which are
of critical military importance to the USSR and its allies,
and are not available from non-Cocom sources.  This action
would assure the continued viability of the multilateral
control system and gain broad acceptance within Cocom of the
minimum necessary standards for national controls.  Serious
effort toward a significant rationalization of the control
list and removal of U.S.  unilateral controls will require a
high-level Administration policy initiative to assign
priority for action and overcome entrenched resistance within
U.S. government agencies.

Adopt standards for resolving jurisdictional disputes between
the Department of Commerce and the Departments of State and
Defense over the control of "dual-use" goods and
technology.  The lack of useful standards for determining the
boundary between the scope of the Export Administration Act
[EEA], administered by the Commerce Department, and the Arms
Export Control Act [AECA], administered by State and Defense,
has created a situation in which non-weapons items with
defense applications are incorporated within the U.S.
Munitions List and treated as weapons items.  The extension
of weapons export policies and procedures to non-weapons
exports in purely commercial transactions in the West results
in unreasonable restrictions on U.S. exports and further
encourages Western European companies to "de-Americanize"
their products.

Seek clarification from the EC regarding the conditions under
which individual Member States will continue to exercise the
right to restrict exports of Cocom-listed goods and
technology to other Member States after 1992.  While
alternative safeguards will probably be licensing may be kept
for munitions and nuclear technology items.  The U.S.,
therefore, should seek understandings with Member States on
how such controls will be administered.

Press the EC Commission to indicate how it will ensure a
common standard of enforcement.  Assurances are needed that
Cocom controls on exports to non-Cocom countries will be
effectively enforced throughout the Community.

Undertake a comprehensive review of U.S. foreign policy
controls to identify areas of unnecessary duplication and
inconsistency that encourage foreign firms to design-out U.S.
products and technologies.  Foreign policy controls are
currently imposed under a broad range of laws and
regulations, including the Foreign Assets Control Act, the
Trading With The Enemy Act, the International Economic
Emergency Powers Act, and the Export Administration Act.
Foreign firms attempting to comply with U.S. laws are faced
with an array of confusing and, at times, conflicting
requirements, most of which have some extraterritorial reach.
The competitive disadvantage created for U.S. firms is
compounded by the fact that other countries are less prone to
use export controls as an instrument of foreign policy and,
when they do, they do not apply such controls
extraterritorally.

U.S. companies interested in avoiding a post-1992 competitive
disadvantage in strategic technology trade need to monitor
carefully developments in the U.S. and the EC, and within
Cocom, and seek to influence the redirection of policy.

The ACTPN therefore recommends that U.S. industry:

Participate in the streamlining of the Cocom control list.
Industry participation in the statutorily-mandated technical
advisory committees should be upgraded and more aggressive in
promoting control list rationalization.  In addition, the
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 permits the
President to include representatives of industry as advisors
to the U.S. delegation at Cocom.  This increased role in
developing U.S. technology transfer policy is in keeping with
the key role played by industry representatives of other
Cocom countries in helping their countries prepare for
multilateral control list negotiations.

Support the initiation of a comprehensive study by the
National Academies of Sciences and engineering of current
U.S. export control policy. The study, which is required by
the 1988 Trade Act, is aimed at providing guidance for
renewal of the Export Administration Act, scheduled for 1990.
Among the major goals established for the study is the
development of dynamic and implementable principles for
determining which technologies should be subject to control
and at what point technological diffusion and/or obsolescence
dictates that a particular technology should be decontrolled.
The study will also develop proposals to harmonize U.S. and
Cocom procedures for dealing with cases of "foreign
availability," i.e., where identical functionally similar
technology exists beyond the reach of the Cocom countries.

Monitor the implementation of the export decontrol measures
included in the 1988 Trade Act.  Particular attention should
be paid to the removal of unilateral export controls for the
least sensitive goods and technology, i.e., those whose
export to controlled countries would require only
notification to Cocom member countries.

Background

The convergence of economic and political change in Europe is
placing new strains on the ability of the U.S. to
unilaterally control the flow of sensitive technologies that
could enhance Soviet military capabilities.  First, European
economic integration is helping create strong competitors
capable of challenging U.S. dominance of high technology
trade for the first time in the post war era.  Economic
integration is leading to the creation of large companies
capable ot achieving greater economies of scale and of
investing heavily in R&D.  This development coincides with
the growing insistence by European countries on nurturing an
indigenous high technology defense industrial base.

Second, although European political integration is still
distant, the EC has already taken its first, tentative steps
toward its goal of assuming a greater role in world affairs.
One of the important changes made by the 1987 Single European
Act was to incorporate the European Political Cooperation
process in the Treaty of Rome, the EC's governing agreement.
The Community has since begun to strengthen its political
structures, including those dealing with foreign policy.  The
key challenge in this arena is the coordination of policy
toward the Soviet Union and East Bloc countries.  European
attitudes on the issue of East-West relations have already
started to diverge from American attitudes, which are only
slowly emerging from the postwar consensus in which European
integration was seen primarily as a bulwark against Soviet
expansionism.

With the current Soviet and East Bloc leadership focused on
internal economic restructuring and pursuing trade and
defense initiatives with the West, most EC Member States are
increasingly persuaded that new realities have overtaken the
postwar consensus.  They argue that a new consensus among
alliance partners is needed, one that places greater emphasis
on multilateral coordination and is more open to East-West
trade.  In this context, Europeans view the continuing U.S.
preoccupation with restrictive East-West technology transfer
policies as misguided.  In particular, continued resistance
to reducing substantially the list of multilaterally
controlled goods and technology serves to undermine adherence
to multilateral constraints as well as inhibit U.S.-based
exporters from establishing trading relationships in Eastern
Europe.

The divergence between U.S. and EC approaches to technology
transfer may become more pronounced as European economic
integration proceeds and internal border controls are
eliminated.  Debate over alternative safeguards for
protecting sensitive technologies is just beginning within
the Community.  The debate is expected to center on the
setting of common minimum standards for licensing and
enforcement, and on the role of the Commission in formulating
and enforcing a borderless control policy.  The UK and
France, for example, have taken the position that they will
not relinquish to the Commission national controls on
munitions, nuclear and other sensitive military technologies;
Germany, on the other hand, has historically expressed the
desire to turn over most controls to the EC.

U.S. export control policies are currently conducted
bilaterally and are based on the U.S. assessment of the risk
of diversion of controlled goods and technology from that
country to the Soviet bloc and the People's Republic of
China.  Other factors considered are possible nuclear weapons
proliferation and foreign policy restrictions aimed at
specific nations.  Countries that participate in multilateral
control agreements, such as the Coordinating Committee
[Cocom], are given preferred treatment.  Cocom administers
three lists of controlled items: munitions, nuclear energy
and "dual-use (i.e., items with both commercial and military
application).  Cocom members include all the EC countries
(except Ireland), the U.S. Canada, Norway, Japan, Turkey and
Australia.  Switzerland and Austria are accorded full Cocom
privileges although they are not voting members.

"Dual-use" technology is increasingly importamt to the Soviet
Union which is intent on closing the existing gap with the
West through aggressive acquisition.  U.S. alliance partners
agree that the acquisition of leading Western "dual-use"
technologies represents a serious military threat and have
been supportive of U.S. attempts to strengthen Cocom.
However, they resent the U.S. tendency to resort to foreign
policy trade sanctions to penalize Soviet and other nations'
political behavior and the application of extraterritorial
controls that signal U.S. mistrust of its Cocom partners.

These strains within the alliance are exacerbated by the more
restrictive U.S. control regime.  A National Academy of
Sciences study in 1987 found that:

"U.S. national security export controls encompass more
products and technologies, are generally more restrictive,
and entail more administrative delays and shipper
uncertainties than those of the other major Cocom countries.
Only the United States requires foreign resellers, even in
countries that are our closest allies, to obtain the prior
approval of-or to account periodically to-the U.S.
government for reexports of U.S.-origin products, U.S.-origin
parts and components incorporated into foreign equipment, and
foreign equipment, and foreign products manufactured with
U.S.-origin technology.  These light of the fact that many
controlled products are available from or through non-Cocom
countries with few or no restrictions."

European countries, for example, have cited U.S.
extraterritorial controls on reexports of U.S.-origin goods
and technology as the reason for denying U.S. participation
in development of the European Fighter Aircraft [EFA} and for
eliminating or designing out U.S. parts and components in
projects supported by Member States.

The U.S. recently has acted to redress some of these
problems.  The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988
contains reforms which, when implemented, will reduce the
cost and competitive burdens of U.S. exports controls for
national security-controlled "dual-use" items, especially
where West-West trade is involved.  These reforms include:
(1) decontrolling the exports of less sensitive U.S.-origin
goods and technology to Cocom and other Free World countries;
(2) decontrolling  the reexport of U.S. parts and components
comprise less than 25% of the end-product.  In addition,
unilateral national security controls are to expire unless
the Department of Comerce determines that there is no other
comparable capability, or that negotiations for multilateral
control are underway.

The U.S. has also taken the initiative within Cocom to
propose upgrading the multilateral control system and to
create greater harmonization of national policies.  The U.S.,
as an incentive, has offered to go beyond the 1988 Trade Act
and remove all requirements for validated licensing of "dual-
use" exports and reexports to and among Cocom countries, and
to reduce substantially the list of multilaterally-controlled
goods and technology.  Cocom Member States have responded
favorably, indicating their willingness to upgrade their
enforcement control systems to an agreed-upon common
standard.  It now remains for the U.S. to initiate a
realistic reduction in the Cocom control list.

An upgraded Cocom system based on common standards would
simultaneously allow removal of U.S. control over reexports
from Cocom and permit a license-free internal market for the
EC.  These actions resolve much of the debate within the
Community over alternative safeguards for protecting
strategic goods and technology once internal borders are
eliminated.

Summary of the Issue

As part of its 1992 program, the EC plans to eliminate
internal customs border controls, and is likely to exert more
authority over the export control policies of Member States.
These changes could increase tensions between the U.S. and EC
over their differing approaches to technology transfer
further justifying European perceptions that U.S. policy is
out of step with new political and economic realities.  If
the U.S. fails to reduce or remove its unilateral controls
over the reexport of U.S.-origin products to third countries,
its company may find it more difficult to export to, and
cooperate with, European firms and governments.  Europeans
are increasingly unwilling to include U.S.-origin goods and
technology in their end-products because of these reexport
controls.  Increased rejection of U.S. goods and technology
by European customers could also discourage both U.S. and EC
firms from conducting research and development in the U.S.

The U.S. should assign higher priority to substantially
reducing the list of multilaterally controlled goods and
technology.  This action would signal the U.S. commitment to
developing and implementing common standards for national
controls among the member countries of Cocom.  Such common
standards must be sufficient to allow removal of U.S.
extraterritorial control over reexports from Cocom countries,
as well as permit a license-free internal market for the
Community.

The U.S. should also press the EC to indicate the extent to
which it will exert authority over the control policies of
Member States, and how it will ensure a common standard of
enforcement.

A Survey of Export Finance Services

Banks in Export Finance - Part I

Servicing the East

By Heather L. McCulloch

The demand for export finance among American companies is
growing as the ranks of new exporters expand, and experienced
players become more active in foreign markets.  While many of
the larger banks are still reluctant to serve any but their
largest customers, others have recognized the potential
business of the expanding market of growing exporters.

In the past, new or infrequent exporters have lost business
to foreign buyers which demanded credit terms.  Considering
the small size of potential shipments and small companies
lack of collateral to support working capital or accounts
receivable financing, many companies did not feel it was
worthwhile to seek credit from reluctant bankers.  Today,
these companies see foreign markets as bearing the greatest
growth potential, so their demand for export finance has
mushroomed.

The following article is the first in a series on banks in
export finance.  The series, based on interviews with trade
finance specialists in banks across the country, will explore
the activities of those banks which are gaining a reputation
for servicing the needs of local exporters.  (The Exporter
welcomes your comments and suggestions as we progress from
the East to West coast in the next issues.)

While many of the larger money center banks have closed down
or strictly limited their trade finance departments in recent
years, several regional and super-regional banks on the
eastern seaboard have given trade finance top priority.
This first article focuses on five east coast banks which are
becoming recognized for their expertise in the market.  They
include the Bank of Boston and Bay Banks in Massachusetts,
Philidelphia National Bank (PNB) in Pennsylvania, Maryland
National Bank (MNB) in Maryland, and Citizens and Southern in
Georgia.

The trade services department of the Bank of Boston provides
exporters with more than the traditional collections and
letter of credit services.  While other banks have pulled out
of the market, Bank of Boston has continued to provide a
diversity of trade finance services for large corporate
clients as well as small and medium-sized exporters.

The majority of the bank's exporting clients have
traditionally been frequent exporters with established buyer
relationships; but the export finance group is beginning to
address the growth potential in the companies which are new
to exporting, or which are beginning to increase their export
sales.

In order to provide such financing without increasing their
international exposure, the Bank of Boston's trade finance
specialists have been trying to work more closely with
government programs to help companies which are small and/or
new to exporting.  In the past, the extensive paperwork
involved discouraged many banks from participating in the
government programs.  The Bank of Boston is trying overcome
this hurdle by developing a reporting package that will
expedite administrative procedures to increase the cost-
effectiveness of lending for smaller transactions.

The bank is interested in doing more accounts receivable
financing for sales covered by Eximbank or FCIA.  They have
also been active in providing buyer credits, a direct loan to
a foreign client to support a customer's sale, again with
Exim or FCIA coverage.

Bay Banks, of Boston, also sees potential in the expanding
middle market.  The bank is trying to figure out ways to use
government working capital and accounts receivable financing
guarantee programs more effectively, so they too can become
more active in providing credit to smaller, or less frequent,
exporters.

One solution reducing the paperwork has been to try to work
more closely with MIFA-Massachusetts Industrial Finance
Agency-the state's export development agency.  MIFA
facilitates the processing of Exim and FCIA applications by
screening companies and providing administrative services in
the application procedure.  (For more information, see
article on state agencies in this issue) Still, according to
the bank's trade finance specialists, the number of bankable
transactions under these programs is still disappointing.

One problem with using government programs is the fact that
many new exporters are start-up companies.  Exim requires
that companies be in existence for three years before they
are eligible for their programs.  Trade finance specialists
within the bank often find this requirement to be a
constraint on the bank's lending because they often see young
companies which would merit the bank's support if Exim were
more lenient.

For medium term lending (mainly for larger transactions of
more than 180 days), the bank is becoming more active in
arranging "supplier credits"-a loan to the buyer, arranged by
the seller.  To minimize its own exposure, the bank works
closely with Exim to arrange a guarantee of the loan, or with
forfaiting houses, which will purchase or participate in the
credit obligation.  For short term financing, the bank may
use the services of an international factoring house, which
will purchase the exporter's foreign receivables at a
discount.

Moving down the coast, Philidelphia National Bank(PNB) is a
growing 'super-regional' which sees trade finance as an
integral part of relationships with corporate clients.  Since
the bank's trade finance unit is a "shadow unit", rather than
a profit center, they are willing to work on all sizes of
transactions.  However, the focus of the bank is on servicing
the needs of its traditional corporate clients, rather than
seeking out new business amongst growing exporters.

PNB bank is willing to provide buyer credits with FCIA
insurance or an Exim guarantee.  They are not involved in
international factoring, but will participate in the
forfait market, if needed to complete a transaction.  PNB has
also been involved in the arrangement of countertrade
transactions, though they will not take title to the goods.

MNC International Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Maryland National Bank.  Focusing on merchant banking, MNC is
more deal-driven than commercial banks.  With a customer base
which stretches across the United States,  this transaction-
oriented, rather than relationship-oriented approach helps
the bank to meet the needs of a diverse customer base.

MNC is among the top ten users of Exim guarantee programs in
the area of post-export finance.  In structuring export
finance, MNC's trade specialists try to respond as quickly as
possible to the customer's needs.  A large percentage are
exporters of capital goods, so no transaction is "standard".
In the area of pre-export finance, the bank is active in the
provision of working capital lending to small companies,
again, it is one of the largest users of Eximbank's programs
(this time for working capital guarantees).

Non-traditional activities of the bank, include growing
cooperation with Maryland National World Trade (formed in
1983, the company was dormant for a period but is now
experiencing a revival), and in a number of countertrade
transactions.  MNC is seeking to expand its business with new
exporters, on a deal-by-deal, or on-going basis.

Citizens and Southern Bank in Atlanta, Georgia, has been
actively providing export finance services for the last 30
years.  While the international departments of money-center
banks were focusing on direct lending in the 1970's, Citizens
and Southern continued to emphasize trade-related lending.
The bank emerged largely unscathed from the third world debt
crises.  Consequently, they have been able to continue to
accept country risk from countries in which other banks have
completely withdrawn.

Citizens and Southern has one of the largest international
departments in the southeast.  It is in the process of
merging with Sovran Bank of Virginia, which is also known for
its trade finance expertise.  On the domestic side, the
bank's focus is on fulfilling the trade finance needs of its
established customers, but they will accomodate the needs of
smaller, or less frequent, exporters if this service is part
of a broader commercial relationship.

The bank has followed the trade finance patterns of its
customers, with a traditional focus on sales to Latin
America.  They are able to accept short term country risk in
countries such as Chile, Brazil and Mexico which other banks
have been unable to do.

To service the needs of its middle market clients, the bank
has developed strong expertise in factoring operations.
Factoring is typically used in transactions of 120 days or
less, and takes two forms, guaranteeing of the receivable at
a nominal rate, and advancing against the guaranteed
receiveable. For the discounting of medium term notes, the
bank is not, itself, an active player in the a-forfait
market.  However, they will consult customers on the
availability of forfaiting services, using access to
forfaiting houses and other banks in the market.

The Roundtable On Credit Conditions

Developments in Africa

Namibia

Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, is moving towards
independence.  At the moment, Namibia is still governed by
the Republic of South Africa.  Following recent elections,
however, the former German and British colony will soon be
preparing the law of the newly independent nation.

The UN General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate for
Namibia in 1966.  The Republic continued to occupy and
administer the territory in spite of a series of UN
resolutions which sought to establish Namibian independence.
Movement towards granting independence, as set out in the UN
Resolution 435 in 1978, was also stymied by armed conflict in
neighboring Angola.

On December 1988, a tripartite peace accord between South
Africa, Angola, and Cuba established a timetable for the
phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and called upon
the UN to effect movement towards Namibian independence.  The
polling for the Constituent Assembly just took place.  These
elections were a contest between the South West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO) and the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance.  Real independence for Namibia is scheduled for
April of 1990.

On the economic side, mining activity is the mainstay of the
Namibian economy representing about one-quarter of GDP and
providing some three-quarters of the territory's foreign
exchange earnings.  Of particular importance are the rich
deposits of alluvial diamonds, of which Namibia produced
approximately one million carats in 1987 alone.

The Rossing open-pit mine produces some 3,600 tons of uranium
annually.  This output is primarily used for generating
electricity.  Other notable resources include copper, zinc,
lead, tin, gold, silver, and semi-precious stones.
Independence should result in the end of South African
sanctions, thereby opening up export markets and promoting
the development of the territory's resource potential.

Some 70% of the population derive their livelihood from the
agricultural sector, mostly employed in subsistence farming.
Because of the arid climate and poor land quality, the sector
is dominated by extensive livestock husbandry, exporting meat
and sheep pelts.  Wheat and maize are the principal arable
crops.

Work is now underway to supply water from the Okavango River
in the north to other parts of the country which should boost
agricultural production.  Upon independence, Namibia hopes to
implement a 200-mile exclusive economic zone to conserve its
fishing resources, and it will develop fish processing
facilities.  With a small domestic market and close ties with
the South African economy, Namibia's manufacturing sector
accounts for only 5% of the GDP.  It produces a limited range
of consumer goods and is undertaking some export processing.
Opportunities for growth are largely in import substitution,
especially in foodstuffs, and in domestic processing of
primary products.  In fiscal 1989-90 the budget deficit will
most likely increase to some 214 million South Africa Rand.
This reduction can be largely attributed to substantial South
African aid reductions.

The outlook for this sparsley populated, predominantly desert
territory is that the country will confront major challenges
in its emergence as an independent nation.  Developed
countries, notably Great Britain and West Germany, have
planned additional assistance, but despite Namibia's
political autonomy, it is likely to remain economically
dependent on South Africa for the foreseeable future.

Ivory Coast

The Ivory Coast was formerly a part of the French West
Africa.  It became independent in 1960 under the leadership
of President Houphouet-Boigny.  Now over eighty years old, he
was confirmed in office for another 5 years in October 1985.
The President heads the unity party, Parti Democratique de la
Cote d'Ivoire.  The constitution provides that, in the event
of the death or resignation of the Head of State, the
President of the National Assembly will take power for an
interim period with an obligation to call new elections
within 90 days.

The Ivory Coast always had a free market economy, and between
1973 and 1980 GDP increased on average by 6.8% per year.
However, per capita income amounted to only US$ 864 in 1988,
partly the result of austerity programs imposed by the IMF
and the World Bank.  The good harvests of 1985 and 1986
improved commodity prices, fuelling a short-lived recovery.
However, the subsequent fall in both commodity prices and the
dollar, together with a reduction in it cocoa crops in 1988,
resulted in liquidity problems for the country.

The banking system of the Ivory Coast came under pressure at
the end of 1988 when resources were required to finance crops
to the detriment of other sectors of the economy.  Exporters
were unable to repay crop credits while credit had to be
restricted because of the increase in external debt
repayments.  As a result of the liquidity crunch, foreign
bank subsidiaries obtained funds from head offices, while
local banks found it increasingly difficult to meet customer
withdrawals.  As some banks closed, others were reorganized
or merged.  (It should be noted, that the local currency, the
CFA franc, is fully convertible with the Franch franc.)

Agriculture in the Ivory Coast generates about 30% of the GDP
and employs approximately 80% of the labor force of the
country.  Agricultural products account for more than three-
quarters of export earnings.  Since the end of the 1970s, the
Ivory Coast has been the world's biggest producer of cocoa.
The country is also the third largest producer of robusta
coffee.  These two crops together account for about one half
of export earnings.

The coffee crop reportedly declined again in the 1988/89
season, to 4.2 million sacks from 4.55 million in the
previous year.  This decline reflects the ageing of plants
and lower guaranteed prices than for cocoa.  The
International Coffee Organization export quota was reduced to
3.6 million sacks in 1988/89, notably because of Western
consumer preference for arabica.  A record cocoa crop of some
750,000 tons was recorded in 1988/89 against 630,000 tons in
1987/88, an increase of 20%.

Cocoa and coffee are largely produced on small-scale
plantations which employ foreign labor and sell their crops
to Caisse de Stabilisation et de Soutien des Prix des
Productions Agricoles (CSSPPA), the State marketing agency,
at prices fixed by the government.  Since 1987, however, the
local cost of cocoa, of about CFA francs 600 per kilo, has
exceeded the world price by about 50%.  With the government
no longer able to make up the difference, planters have had
to sell crops at half the guaranteed price or to accept
purchase vouchers in lieu of payment.

In order to broaden the agricultural base, cotton is being
promoted.  In 1986/87 the Ivory Coast became the third-
largest cultivator among African cotton producers.  Exports
of tropical fruit and rubber have also increased
significantly.  Rubber production is expected to double by
1990, making the Ivory Coast Africa's largest producer.  Rice
output has also been increased considerably and self-
sufficiency has been virtually achieved in pork and poultry.
Wheat imports have been held down despite continuing high
population growth rate.  The production of yams and manioc
fell, by 50% and 20% respectively in 1986/87.

Fish production meets 60% of the domestic needs. Abidjan is
Africa's largest tuna fishing port, accounting for almost a
quarter of the total Atlantic tuna catch.  The total area of
exploitable timber is estimated at only one million hectars,
against 15.6 million at the start of the century, because of
the excessive clearing of forest land.

Industry, including mining and construction, accounts for
about 13% of the GDP, but employs only around 4% of the labor
force.  Agricultural and foodstuff processing account for
about 40% of output, with coffee and cocoa the major sectors.
Some 40 firms produce textiles.  Wood is processed by about
65 firms that depend on the level of activity in the local
building trade, which accounts for 3% of the GDP.  Over two-
thirds of industry is lcoated in and around the commercial
capital of Abidjan.

The Ivory Coast remains a net importer of energy.  Following
the rapid introduction of thermal turbines after the drought
of 1983 to 1985, thermal power stations now account for 60%
of total energy.  The possibility of exploiting rich natural
gas deposits in the coastal region has been considered, but
relatively lower oil prices have restrained the earlier
enthusiasm for using gas instead of oil to fuel generators.

On the financial side, total expenditures for 1989 have been
set at CFA francs 645 billion, an increase of 1.25 from the
previous year.  This amount includes an increase of 1.4% in
operating expenditure to CFA francs 500 billion.  The special
investment and equipment budget (BSIE), of CFA francs 145
billion, has been increased by 1% and is being devoted mainly
to major agriculture programs (39% of the budget), housing
and urban development (11%), and training (8%).

Budget spending, particularly under the public sector's
consolidated budget, could turn out to be substantially
higher than forecast.  The public sector's current revenue
should amount to CFA francs 880 billion, from which CSSPPA's
forecast deficit of CFA francs 180 billion must be deducted.
Current expenditure is expected to total CFA francs 700
billion.  Including the BSIE, which has local debt of CFA
francs 50 billion and external debt of CFA francs 470
billion, total expenditure will total around CFA francs 1,370
billion.  With CSSPPA's cumulative arrrears and government-
guaranteed loans of CFA francs 360 billion, the public
sector's financing requirement will increase to CFA francs
850 billion (US$2.7 billion), or 28% of the GDP in 1989 and
to fall to about CFA francs 500 in 1990.

With approved or anticipated external funding of about CFA
francs 475 billion, about CFA francs 140 billion for 1989
will have to be generated through domestic measures such as
higher taxes, a reduction in "presidential levies", and a cut
in guaranteed producer prices, none of which will be easy to
achieve in the country.   As a result of this, adjustment
will be spread over several years if the austerity policy is
maintained.

With the Ivory Coast the world's largest cocoa producer, and
because the quality of the bean is of the highest grade, the
President adopted a policy in 1988 of holding back exports in
an unsuccessful attempt to raise world prices significantly.
Almost 90% of the crop has reportedly been sold but for only
a portion of the prices demanded.  An agreement reached
with a commercial company in December 1988 provided for the
removal of 400,000 tons of cocoa in 1988/89.  Of this amount
125,000 tons was applicable to 1988, half of which was
stocked in European ports for two years.  The selling price
was reduced to the world price for the Ivory Coast cocoa (CFA
francs 500 per kilo) by waiving a removal tax of CFA francs
100 per kilo. In June of 1989, a contract for the removal of
280,000 tons of cocoa, the balance of the 1987-89 crop years,
was signed with another commercial concern.

Despite the generally unfavorable trend in commodity prices
in 1989, with cocoa prices falling by 10% and cotton prices
by 7.5% (the exception was coffee with a 4.5% price
increase), a rise in export volume should increase export
earnings by 12% to US$2.7 billion.  Imports are not expected
to increase because of the foreign exchange shortage and the
implementation of the IMF-agreed austerity program.  One
aspect of this program is expected to be a fall in the
guaranteed producer price for cocoa to CFA francs 250 per
kilo from CFA francs 400.

The rise in the trade surplus to US$1.1 billion, an increase
of 42%, should offset the adverse impact of higher
international interest rates.  The current account deficit is
expected to fall to US$1 billion from US$1.3 billion in 1988
but, at the equivalent of 10.5% of GDP, it will remain high.

Principal and interest arrears are in the vicinity of CFA
francs 470 billion, while payments to the IMF and the World
Bank remain behind schedule.  Debt is increasing rapidly.
According to the World Bank, it amounted to US$13.5 billion
at the end of 1987, a figure which includes guaranteed long-
and medium-term public debt of US$8.4 billion.  According to
some estimates, total outstanding debt at end-1989 could
amount to US$15.5 billion if short-term debt is included.
This implies a debt servicing of about US$2.9 billion, or 86%
of foreign exchange revenues prior to rescheduling.

France is the major trading partner of the Ivory Coast,
accounting for 35% and 16% respectively of the country's
imports and exports.  Nigeria, the Netherlands, and Japan
each provide about 6% to 7% of imports, while the major
export markets, apart from France, are the United States
(12%), West Germany(10%), and Italy(8%).

Latest Information on the Ivory Coast: Responding to the
demands of creditors for deep cuts in the public-sector
spending, the country's President has radically streamlined
the government.  Ten of the overall 39 ministeries were
abolished.  In general, credit terms extended to the country
show all terms, from open account to strict letter of credit
transactions.  The delay on lenient terms has been longer in
recent months, and some exporters have to wait several weeks
for payment.  Overall, payments are still being made.
Exporters should definitely check the creditworthiness of
their customers, both old and new, to avoid any surprises.

State Export Development Agencies

States Pick Up the Slack in Export Finance

By Heather L. McCulloch

The notion that small business in America is an untapped
source of exports which, once mobilized, will turn around
America's trade deficit is, today, a common perception.
Though the theory has yet to be proven, state administrators
of newly established export finance agencies are trying their
best to push local companies into international markets.

The Reagan administration drastically reduced federal funding
for Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) programs, recommending that
exporters turn to the private sector for export financing.
Unfortunately, in the wake of the third world debt crisis and
the resulting increase in capital adequacy requirements;
American commercial banks were simultaneously retreating from
trade finance, particularly for their smaller customers.

Small and medium-sized American companies are making progress
in tackling foreign markets; but their lack of access to
export finance remains a major barrier to overseas sales.
Small or infrequent exporters face many barriers to obtaining
credit from commercial banks.  It is harder for smaller
companies to obtain working capital financing for domestic
instances; but when it comes to cash flow being dependent on
foreign receivables, the banks' concerns about
creditworthiness are multiplied.

The majority of U.S. exports are sold on a cash or short term
credit basis (less than 90 days), but exporters are
increasingly demanded to extend credit terms in competitive
foreign markets.  In many cases where exporters can not
extend credit, the sale is lost to competiters who can.
In some states, few or no banks are willing to provide post-
shipment export financing, even for their largest customers.
Finally, smaller exporters have difficulties dealing with
FCIA insurance programs because the administrative costs bite
into the profit margin of a small shipment, and private
insurance for small transactions is typically hard to come
by.

State governments have begun to respond to the gap in
financing between the private sector and the federal
government.  According to a recent survey by First Washington
Associates; as of June 1989, export-financing legislation had
been passed in 31 states and 24 states have operational
programs.  Most state export development programs have the
specific goal of helping small and medium-sized non-exporters
to enter foreign markets.  Unlike export credit agencies in
other countries; they are designed and operated to meet local
needs, independent of federal management or financing.

A diverse array of state programs has been developed, ranging
from pre- and post-shipment lending to state guarantees,
insurance and financial advice.  Some state agencies have
limited their involvement to counseling and documentary
assistance.  For example, the Massachusetts Industrial
Finance Agency (MIFA) provides export finance counseling and
assistance in administrative aspects of Exim and FCIA loan
applications.

Other programs, like Minnesota's Export Finance Authority
(MEFA), play a larger role in the transaction.  MEFA
encourages bank involvement by arranging export insurance and
loan guarantees, as well as providing Eximbank packaging
assistance and financial counseling.  MEFA supported $4.3
million in export sales last year.

The ultimate success of the state programs lies in their
ability to bring the private sector back into export finance.
Illinois was a pioneer in working with commercial banks to
provide direct loans to exporters.  In 1984, the state passed
legislation to create the Illinois Export Development
Authority (IEDA), a state export finance program.  The
program provides fixed-rate loans to local exporters, whose
exports have a minimum state content of 25%.  The loans will
cover 90% of an export transaction, with a maximum
transaction size of $500,000.

The California Export Finance Office (CEFO) is one of the
most successful state export finance agencies.  The program
has supported over $160 million of export sales since its
inception.  The majority of the office's activities have
since been focused on providing pre-export guarantees for
working capital loans.  For a guarantee fee of 1%, the agency
will guarantee 85% of the export transaction, to a maximum of
$350,000.  The program may soon be moving into post-shipment
finance lending.  Administrators of the fund are currently
experimenting with the possibility of a foreign accounts
receivables lending program.

Some state agencies have also been playing a more direct role
in providing direct working capital loans to support exports.
The New Jersey Economic Development Authority recently began
to offer a one-year revolving line of credit of up to
$100,000 for state exporters.  The line will cover the
exporters costs of materials and production for foreign
sales.  A confirmed letter of credit from the buyer or
coverage by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association is a
prerequisite for state participation.

State and local governments have also begun to work together
with the federal government to bring Eximbank programs down
to the level of city government.  In 1987, experimental
Eximbank City/State Agency Cooperation Programs were launched
in three states and three cities.  The programs, designed as
distribution vehicles for federal export finance programs,
offer training for state and city personnel by Exim staff
members.

The City of Los Angeles has implemented the program in a
particularly innovative manner.  Loans to local exporters are
approved by the city; guaranteed by the state program or
Eximbank; and financed by a $15 million credit line provided
by Imperial Bank, an L.A.-based regional bank.  Initiated in
1987, the program is the largest municipal export finance
program in the nation.

Despite the demonstrated success of state programs in
bringing new exporters into the market, critics of the
lack of federal participation argue that the fragmented
approach is not adequate to remedy America's trade imbalance.

Howard Lewis, vice president of the National Manufacturers
Association, is skeptical of the federal government's
tendency to leave export finance problems to the states.  L.
Fargo Wells, head of the California Export Finance Office,
emphasizes the fact that state programs are meant to
supplement, not replace, Eximbank programs.  States are
restricted by size, budgetary restrictions as well as
political realities, so they can not be expected to solve
America's deficit woes single-handedly.

With current budget considerations, however, it is unlikely
that the Bush administration will revitalize a currently
'defunded' Eximbank.  By design or default, the state
agencies remain at the forefront of public sector export
finance.

Export Development, Southern-Style

Southern States Adopt Unified Strategy

The Southern Growth Policies Board held a key conference in
New Orleans on December 8-9, 1989 to set an international
agenda for the southern states from 1990 to 1995.  Attending
were over 70 high ranking representatives of twelve southern
state governments, legislators, regional organizations,
universities, research organizations, the federal government,
and others from the public and private sectors.  Uppermost on
the agenda was the subject of how the region could encourage
the growth of exports and international investment using a
variety of new programs and policy approaches.

Export finance and other trade promotion program were a
special focus of attention.  The conference noted the
limitations of existing statistics on international trade,
discussed the major issues affecting export success, and
agreed on a variety of research projects which would help
southern legislatures and administrative agencies decide
which policies and programs could be most helpful to their
states.

The Southern Growth Policies Board will play a catalytic and
coordinating role in seeking to implement the research
projects endorsed by the conference and will share the
results between all members.  This is the first time that a
regional grouping of states has gotten together for the joint
planning of comprehensive research and development efforts
that will lead to increased international trade and
investment.  In the past this had always been done by the
individual states with consequent duplication of effort and
suboptimal utilization of the results.

The Services Trade Deficit

House Export Task Force

Subcommittee Hearing Summary

By Craig Pena, staff member of the House Export Task Force.

The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International
Economic Policy and Trade recently conducted a hearing on the
services trade deficit.  The deficit was the first of its
kind in thirty years.

Chairman Sam Gejdenson, in his opening statement, explained
that there are two components to the service trade balance,
investment and sales.  Investment, the larger of the two
components, compares the earnings of foreigners' investments
in the U.S. with the earnings of Americans' investments
overseas.  That portion of the service balance is currently
in deficit.  The second factor of the services trade balance
is sales performance.  Here the U.S. ran a $5 billion surplus
in the second quarter of 1989.

The purpose of Friday's hearing was, according to the
Chairman "to find out the story behind America's newest
deficit." Comments from some of the witnesses are as follows:

From C. Fred Bergsten. Director, Institute for International
Economics:

1.  Foreign investment in the U.S. has become greater than
U.S.  investment abroad.  However, on a per dollar basis,
U.S. investments overseas still outperform foreign
investments in the United States.  (Generally the foreign
assets held by the U.S. are older investments which are
reaching a maximum yield.  When the foreign held assets
mature, the services trade deficit can be expected to
worsen.)

2.  To alleviate the federal deficit, Bergsten argues that a
tax increase will have to exist and recommends a value added
tax (VAT) or an across the board consumption tax.


From The Honorable Linda Powers.  Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Services, United States Department of Commerce:

1.  The services trade deficit of the past provided a
substantial "offset to the merchandise trade deficit."

2.  "Lack of comprehensive trade data on services is indeed
frustrating to U.S. government efforts to formulate and
execute trade policy for the service sector".  Quite often
many "service trade and income flows do not pass (sic)
generally pass through gateways where they can be easily
counted.  Accordingly, the system of collecting data on
services trade must be based largely on surveys of service
companies."

3.  Powers states that "true traded services have not moved
into a deficit but show a growing surplus with exports
exceeding imports by approximately 6.8 billion dollars during
the second quarter of 1989."  Of these "true services" it is
travel and transportation that acquired the sizeable
deficits.  These deficits are offset by growing surpluses
from technology licensing and other royalties and licensing
fees which bring the entire "true services" balance to
surplus.

4. "A recurring problem for exported-minded U.S.  service
providers is the persistence of a multitude of foreign trade
barriers to services.  One example is the European
Community's television broadcast directive...  [However], the
development of trade rules and procedures for the progressive
elimination of services barriers is a major component of the
Uruguay Round trade negotiations."

From The Honorable Richard Self, Deputy Assistant U.S.  Trade
Representative:

1. Self agreed with Powers that there is no deficit in the
U.S. services sector.

2. "...the problem reflected by the data appears to stem from
increased foreign investment in the U.S. rather than poor
performance of the service sector."

3. "It is the role of the U.S. government to establish and
maintain a suitable international climate to enable U.S.
service industries to gain access to markets and compete
fairly."

From Gordon Cloney. President, International Insurance
Council:

1. "International Trade Statistics for insurance are
fragmentary because insurance transactions between countries
do not pass through the equivalent of a customs house where
recording can take place."

2. Cloney lists three types of trade discrimination practices
faced by the insurance industry:

a. The practice of simply closing a market to the U.S.
insurer by nationalization or domestication of the market."

b. "...making it impossible to set up, license and organize
an effective establishment to operate in the market."

c. Those [practices] which cripple the commercial operations
of the foreign insurer even when they are admitted and
permitted to organize.

3. "The U.S. must be sure it provides its international
insurers with as good a commercial base for global operations
as possible.  Industry and government should cooperate to
identify and reduce or eliminate domestic disincentives to
doing an international business from the U.S.  Our state
regulators are beginning to pursue this worthwhile
objective."

All witnesses, while having varied points of view, agree that
as time progresses it will be the ever growing income from
U.S. assets held by foreigners that will lead to a further
deterioration of the services trade balance in the future.

Governors Create Export Database

The NGA has created a database that will be useful for
tracking the growth of exports state by state. While it
does not answer the question of how many exporters there are
in each state, the new database does allow states to track
the growth of export industries in their state year by year.

This database is necessary because the Census Bureau does not
have the funds to provide trade statistics below the national
level, in fact, the only detailed statistics are from the
1987 trade year. In 1989, the Shipper's Export Declaration
database of transactions will be compared with the Census of
Manufacturers' database of establishments to indentify the
number and type of exporters in each state, at the four digit
SIC level.  Even so, it will not be possible to update the
Census Bureau data.

The new service being offered by the National Governors
Association, in cooperation with DRI, will make it possible
to distribute national trade statistics to state activity at
the more detailed three digit level SIC classification,
through the use of an input/output table. The service is
called Expolink.

Expolink contains the value of US exports to more than 141
countries by state-by 3 digit SIC industry-for the fifty
states and the District of Columbia.  Estimated from several
sources, including the US Commerce Department's Origin of
Movement data series, Expolink contains the files of total
exports as well as a breakdown by mode of transportation (air
and sea).

EDIA - 21st Conference

National EDI Systems Conference and Exhibit

The Maturation of EDI

By R.T.Crowley

Once again, as they have for the last score of years, the
members of the EDI community made their annual pilgrimage to
Washington, DC to participate in the TDCC: The Electronic
Data Interchange Association's two-and-a-half day conference.
Actually, as any regular attendee to this event knows all too
well, the conference itself may last only two-and-a-half
days, but the other related meetings and happenings scheduled
by other groups in conjunction with it stretch things out to
a full week.  While many of the usual rites of this regular
week long "mating season" of EDI were observed, there were a
number of notable new twists and additions that point the way
to the future evolution of EDI as we now know it.

I am fond of saying that to be involved in EDI is to be
passionately in love with change.  EDI represents a
monumental change to the way that mankind will communicate
and do business, but EDI itself is changing in many ways.
The first TDCC conference, twenty-one years ago, consisted of
a little less than one-hundred fifty individuals who came
together to discuss the, then "brand new", technology of EDI.
Most attendees were either traffic managers from transport
companies or production managers from manufacturing companies
with a small sprinkle of computer professionals from the same
companies to advise them about the technical aspects of the
discussions.  Over the intervening years, the cast of at-
tendees has undergone a subtle change which was quite
apparent in the over two thousand people who came to
Washington, DC this year.

Traditionally, in our society, the twenty-first year
represents the point of passage from adolescence to
adulthood.  This twenty-first year saw the coming of age of a
new type of individual that can now take their place as the
EDI Professional.  These individuals are the consultants,
neo-consultants, and semi-consultants who work for many types
of companies, and specialize in EDI as a profession.
Conferences like this one are the places where these people
come together to learn their trade, sharpen their skills, and
share ideas.  This conference showed that EDI is no longer a
sideline, but a primary job skill that needs to be treated as
such by business and industry.

This process of maturation is good for EDI as a whole.  For
most of its life, EDI has been something that has been
relegated to the systems departments of many companies with
the advice of the commercial management to identify the
needs of the company.  EDI now has to be taken as a primary
corporate function with roots extending into both the
commercial and systems side of any enterprise.

This change in the complexion of EDI was evident in the types
of sessions presented at the conference.  In the past, these
sessions were devoted to discussions of the specific
application of EDI in specific industries.  This year that
accent changed to a more general view of the use of EDI in
business as a whole.  The subjects presented included such
topics as "EDI Support Requirements for Smaller Trading
Partners," "EDI: An Academic Perspective," and "Legal
Considerations in Planning, Establishing and Managing EDI
Programs."

All of these topics address the real business needs and
theories that underlie the true purpose for the use of EDI.
EDI is not simply a means of automating specific business
tasks, but a way of integrating the flow of information,
material, and product through a chain that starts with raw
materials, progresses through transport and manufacturing,
and ends at the ultimate consumer of the product.  This true
nature of EDI was well evident at this year's conference.

The exhibition area also reflected the view of EDI as a
profession in itself.  More exhibits than ever before showed
the tools of the EDI trade, rather than the specific
applications of EDI that are available for doing business
with specific companies.  A myriad of generalized software
packages, communications networks, and consulting services
could be seen in the exhibition area, that allow any company
to become EDI-capable in short order.  It was obvious that
EDI is now available to all levels and sizes of business, and
at a reasonable cost.

The most significant event of the conference, however, was a
luncheon address by The Honorable Esteban E. Torres, United
States House of Rep-resentatives (D-California).  Congressman
Torres used this forum to announce the proposal of a
Congressional initiative to encourage the use of EDI in small
business.  In his position as Chair of the House Small
Business Subcommittee on Environment and Labor, he stated
that he would hold a series of field hearings during the
summer of 1990 on the impact and application of EDI in the
small business community of the United States.

The Congressman also stated that he would investigate
legislation that would provide a tax credit for the use of
EDI for both small business and big business in their
interaction with small business.  These two initiatives will
go a long way to encouraging the use of EDI to an even
greater extent, and is supported by an EDIA Task Force
directed toward the Small Business Community of the United
States.  The EDI community should welcome this announcement
with open arms, and support it to the best of their ability.

We have always spoken of EDI as a concept that will lead us
all to a bright future.  I suggest that future has now
dawned, and we will move into it during the 1990's.  Many are
fond of talking of how different this world will be at the
impending change of millennium in the year 2000.  The
shifting of the world political climate, the 1992 accords in
Europe, and the proliferation of EDI both nationally and
internationally will all contribute to this.  We, in EDI, can
look with pride to the significance of our own contribution
to this change.

EDI and Third Party Managers

Middlemen on the Fast Track

By Donald R. Greenwood

The historical role of the freight forwarder and broker must
be singled out if one is to understand the dynamics of
international trade.  This market segment has traditionally
been comprised of numerous small and medium sized companies,
the majority of which employs less than five people.

Until quite recently, most of these forwarders and brokers
used little automation in their day-to-day activities.  Their
primary means of communication consisted of the telephone,
facsimile, telex, couriers, and mail.  With the introduction
of the mini- and micro- computers, many of these companies
began to automate their back office functions (i.e.,
accounting and financial functions).  However, due to a lack
of off-the-shelf software and the high cost of people to
develop new software applications, these computer systems
were rarely used in the day-to-day operation of managing the
in and outbound international shipments.

The emergence of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and its
associated value-added computer applications, has sparked a
demand for more accurate shipment information and processing.
As a result, a new player-called the logistics management
company-is emerging.  These new full-service logistics
companies manage the physical and information flow of
shipments-from the purchase order all the way through to
final delivery.

Logistics management companies are making investments in
computer hardware, application software, and communications
to support their primary business.  This investment, in turn,
is forcing changes on the forwarders and brokers to automate
their own operations.  The need for expensive technology is
making survival difficult for small and medium-sized
forwarders and brokers not servicing a niche market.

The emergence of sophisticated third party managers has
led to several acquisitions and mergers within the industry.
The resulting influx of investment capital is allowing these
companies to expand both vertically and horizontally, with
the resulting larger companies increasing their services and
locations worldwide.  If the current trend continues, it
appears that fewer and larger forwarders, or "mega-
forwarders", will be managing the movement of international
shipments.  This trend is occurring within Europe, as well as
in North America.

If one were to forecast what changes are likely to occur in
the industry in the future, I would venture to say that
the Electronic Forwarder will emerge in the mid-1990's.  The
Electronic Forwarder will be a fully automated
forwarder/broker who has access to a worldwide communications
network for the electronic exchange of documents and
shipment-related information.

It will be possible to exchange information instantaneously
between clients, carriers (both domestic and international),
ports, government agencies, off-shore forwarders and brokers,
as well as ultimate consignees.  This information will be
available totally electronically and will provide immediate
accessibility from mainframe, mini-, and micro- computers
located around the world.

New products will include applications that address both the
operational and customer support needs of the industry.  They
will meet the needs of both back-office support systems as
well as the primary activities of the companies in the
international trade industry by integrating software with a
worldwide communications network that provides:

-shipment tracking and tracing (international and domestic)
-transportation scheduling
-electronic booking
-equipment tracking and management
-export/import documentation generation and exchange
broadcast messaging EDI with full standards support.
-electronic payments
-manifesting systems
-bay plan management

Although initially these applications wil be developed for
access via micro, mini, and mainframe computers, addressing
voice response systems via a handheld telephone handset will
be addressed.  These are just a few of the applications the
GE Information Services are developing to address the needs
of the industry.

transportation services at GE Information Services.  For more

EDI Standards

Edifact and CEN Join Forces
(Reprinted from EDIFACTS, the bulletin of the Western
European EDIFACT Board.)

In Helsinki, at a meeting held on the 27-28 September 1989,
the WE/EB arrived at an agreement with the European standards
body, CEN, which will give it associated body status.

Cen, the European Committee for Standardization, is made up
of the national standards bodies of the 18 EC and EFTA Member
States.  It works to implement harmonized standards in
Europe.

Once standards have been issued by CEN, they must be adopted
by the CEN members as national standards.  CEN has already
adopted some of the components of UN/EDIFACT, issuing the
data element directory as EN27 372 and the syntax rules as
EN29 735.  In the future, it will issue relevant UN messages
as European standards.

The signing of this new agreement will strengthen the
standards - making the role of the WE/EB, putting European
companies one step ahead in their preparations for the
integrated market place of 1992.

Technical Help To Exporters

European Certification Update

A look at what has happened to approval marks over the last
seventeen years.

In June 1972, Technical Help to Exporters' Quarterly Bulletin
featured an article on approval marks.  It looked at a range
of European marks then in existence, and the extensive use
which many European manufacturers made of them to sell into
different countries. Seventeen years on, an understanding of
the need for approval marks in the markets of different
countries remains just as important, despite moves towards
European harmonization.  All the marks shown in the 1972
article are still in existence; in fact, a few have been
added-particularly in Germany where the need for some third
party indication that a product is safe is most widespread.

It must be admitted that most serious exporters are much more
aware of the need for some sort of an approval mark than they
were seventeen years ago.  But many still think that the
'Common Market' and the approach of '1992' will obviate the
need for them to do much about it.

Directives from the European Commission on subjects such as
construction products, toys, personal protective equipment,
and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) are now illustrating
a European CE mark which is intended to indicate compliance
with the directives.  In some cases a manufacturer can put
this mark on his product and thus make his own claim of
compliance.  In other cases some test results from a
'recognized' laboratory must be available to support the
claim.  This raises many questions:-Will the need for
national marks go away?  Will national marks be obsolete
after 1992? Will national marks still be applied in addition
to the CE mark, or will national marks come to mean more than
they mean today, having 'quality', 'performance', or 'fitness
for purpose' connotations?  The German government's GS mark
which means 'tested for safety' is in fact used together with
the mark of the organization which did the testing, such as
VDE, TUV, BG, RAL, etc.

In the UK the British Standars Institute (BSI) Kitemark which
has existed since 1902 and the Safety Mark which was
developed in 1973 both mean something to purchasers in
Britain.  Both require a product not just to be safe but also
to be backed up, by BSI, as an indication of established
quality control.  The license has to satisfy BSI that his
manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing a
product made under quality controlled conditions.  Other
countries' marks indicate a similar process and are
recognized as such by purchasers in these countries.  They
are not, therefore, going to disappear overnight in 1992 just
because the Commission publishes a directive which
promulgates a CE mark.

Maybe one day we shall see fewer certification marks than
there are today but, as in the USA, it will be the market
place that will determine which, or even if, a certain mark
is needed.  Exporters can not ignore the need for
certification now and in the future.

Standards Europe

Report of US - EC Standards Discussions

Report provided by the Department of Commerce

On October 4 and 5, 1989, the U.S. Department of Commerce and
U.S. private sector experts met with experts on standards-
related matters from the European Community Commission and
the Committee for European Standardization (CEN) and the
Committee for European Electrotechnical Standardization
(CENELEC) to discuss U.S. concerns arising from the EC's 1992
initiatives to harmonize European standards, testing, and
certification.

Mandate and Objective

This was the first meeting between the United States and the
European Community that brought government and private sector
experts together for a detailed review of standards-related
matters.  In recent months, representatives of U.S. and
European private sector standards interests met on these
issues.  However, there was a growing and an overwhelming
expectation from the users of standards that governments
needed to formally engage on this matter to develop a broad
and balanced review.

It was expected that this meeting would clear up confusion
and misunderstanding and relieve concern stemming from the
EC's EC 1992 initiatives in standards, testing and
certification.  It was further expected that, where problems
were identified, the governments and their private sectors
would determine the appropriate next steps.

The meetings resulted from a May 31 agreement between U.S.
Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher and the EC Commission
Vice President Martin Bangemann.  At that time the U.S. and
the EC governments agreed that they:

-share the goal that the EC's single market should contribute
to sustaining an effective liberalization of trade and
investment.

-commit to the work of international standardization bodies
and the principle of transparency in standardization, testing
and certification.

-afford imports equal access to testing and certification
procedures as enjoyed by domestic products.

-encourage the recently-initiated exchanges between European
and United States standards bodies that advance these goals.

-meet and formally discuss any issues of mutual concern
regarding regulations, private sector standards activity, or
access to testing and certification for products.

Standards Development In The European Community

The European Community has devised a series of sectoral
strategies to terminate trade barriers within the EC market
due to standards-related practices.  These strategies follow
two general frameworks-one for regulated products and one for
non-regulated products.

The European Community intends to regulate food, drugs,
autos, and tractors by issuing mandatory harmonized European
technical specifications legislated entirely by the EC
Commission.  Any product meeting these legislated standards
is guaranteed the free circulation of the entire EC market.

The European Commmunity also intends to legislate harmonized
essential requirements covering safety, consumer protection,
and the environment for a wide range of products listed in
the Annex.  Products able to meet these essential
requirements are guaranteed free circulation throughout the
European Community.

The essential requirements and the criteria to meet these
essential requirements differ widely from product to product
depending on the level of risk and commercial factors.  Each
EC product directive specifies these differences.  Directives
are published in the EC Official Journal.

These product specific directives mandate the criteria to be
applied for declaring conformity to the mandatory
requirements, types of testing, and the nature of the
certification required in order to market the product in the
European Community.

The EC Commission has asked the European standards entities,
CEN and CENELEC to develop voluntary product standards that
in general are presumed to meet the mandatory requirements in
the EC directives.  In the case of construction products, the
EC Commission is developing "interpretative documents" and
code-type standards that concern the general safety
requirements of the building and engineering works themselves
which will ultimately be regulations.  At the same time,
CEN/CENELEC is developing voluntary standards for the
products that fall under this sector.

For telecommunications equipment and software, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute is developing
harmonized standards for terminal equipment and software.
These standards must be adopted by telecommunications
administrations in Europe.  Any product meeting these
standards is free to circulate in the European Community.

All other products not covered by directives are unregulated.
Technical specifications associated with the sale of these
products are those specified between a willing buyer and a
willing seller.  Such unregulated products are guaranteed
free circulation throughout the community.

Freedom of circulation in the EC Community for regulated and
unregulated products is supported by the legal principle of
mutual recognition.  That is, any product that is able to be
sold in one EC member state market is guaranteed access to
all other EC markets.

For the regulated products listed in the annex, the
CEN/CENELEC needs to develop 900 product standards by
January 1, 1993.  In the event that harmonized CEN/CENELEC
standards are not completed by that date, the European
Community will adopt an interim standard until the
CEN/CENELEC work can be completed.  This interim standard
will probably be selected from the existing European
standards which most closely approximates the requirements in
the EC legislation.  The EC could select a non-EC standard.
The EC probably will not allow the mutual recognition of
existing national standards as the transition.

Although the EC Commission has no intention of changing
product standards legislation already adopted, in certain
instances current legislation will be amended to simplify
requirements within product groups and improve consistency of
approach for companies.  For example, the machinery directive
will be amended to include small forklift trucks and lifting
and loading equipment which were covered by previous
legislation.  In like manner, the EC is reevaluating the
consistency of approach for electrical products which could
result in amendments to recent directives and the termination
of older directives.

Because the EC product directives were developed over a
period of 5 years or more, there are a variety of
inconsistent requirements for products regarding testing,
certification and marking.  The EC Commission can be expected
to develop various amendments as the system evolves.

For telecommunications equipment and software, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute is developing
harmonized standards for terminal equipment and software.
These standards must be adopted by telecommunications
administrations in Europe.  Any product meeting these
standards is free to circulate in the European Community.

All other products not covered by directives are unregulated.
Technical specifications associated with the sale of these
products are those specified between a willing buyer and a
willing seller.  Such unregulated products are guaranteed
free circulation throughout the community.

Freedom of circulation in the EC Community for regulated and
unregulated products is supported by the legal principle of
mutual recognition.  That is, any product that is able to be
sold in one EC member state market is guaranteed access to
all other EC markets.

For the regulated products listed in the annex, the
CEN/CENELEC needs to develop 900 product standards by
January 1, 1993.

In the event that harmonized CEN/CENELEC standards are not
completed by that date, the European Community will adopt an
interim standard until the CEN/CENELEC work can be completed.
This interim standard will probably be selected from the
existing European standards which most closely approximates
the requirements in the EC legislation.  The EC could select
a non-EC standard.  The EC probably will not allow the mutual
recognition of existing national standards as the
transition.

Although the EC Commission has no intention of changing
product standards legislation already adopted, in certain
instances current legislation will be amended to simplify
requirements within product groups and improve consistency of
approach for companies.  For example, the machinery directive
will be amended to include small forklift trucks and lifting
and loading equipment which were covered by previous
legislation.  In like manner, the EC is reevaluating the
consistency of approach for electrical products which could
result in amendments to recent directives and the termination
of older directives.

Because the EC product directives were developed over a
period of 5 years or more, there are a variety of
inconsistent requirements for products regarding testing,
certification and marking.  The EC Commission can be expected
to develop various amendments as the system evolves.

The European Community requires all member states to regulate
further national standards development so that new standards
activity does not interfere in the EC internal market.
Generally, member states must notify the EC of new national
standards development proposals and the EC Commission must
decide if it wants to intercede with a proposal for the
development of an EC-wide standard.  Also, under the Single
European Act, EC member states may keep a previously existing
essential requirement more stringent than the EC proposal if
the EC Commission agrees.  These are the only exceptions to
the harmonization process.

International Standardization and EC 1992

In order to complete its work by January 1, 1993, CEN/CENELEC
has stated that it wants to use international standards (ISO
and IEC standards) where these standards are appropriate to
meet the EC's essential requirements and the standards can be
developed in a timely manner.

The United States stated that sole reliance on ISO/IEC
requires effort to make the ISO/IEC activities and procedures
relevant to manufacturers and professionals in the respective
markets.

The United States stated that it was interested in using the
ISO/IEC forum as one of the ways to participate in the EC
standards development. In some products, the EC had adopted
IEC and ISO standards.  However, in many product areas there
was no international work, international work had been
blocked, or international work was not being used.

The United States government and the EC Commission agreed to
review the ability of their respective private standards
bodies to live up to their commitment to use international
standards.

Transparency of EC Commission and CEN/CENELEC

The EC Commission will not share early drafts of EC
directives.  The only official access to information on
essential requirements is in the EC Official Journal.

The EC Commission is willing to consult with U.S. interests
at any point over its regulations.  CEN/CENELEC stated that
it has recently instituted several changes to make its
process more transparent to non-members. CEN/CENELEC
publishes draft standards and monthly activity reports that
summarize working group activities.  These publications are
available through ANSI New York City.

CEN/CENELEC has agreed to accept comments from U.S. interests
through ANSI in New York City.  Comments may be made at any
stage of standardization.

ANSI intends to submit all U.S. comments on CEN/CENELEC
standards activities to review by the Technical Advisory
Groups (TAGs) before being submitted to CEN/CENELEC.  In
the absence of TAGs, ANSI intends to submit comments directly
to CEN/CENELEC.

CEN/CENELEC have encouraged their working groups to accept
oral presentations from non-EC interests.

ANSI reported that its proposal to ISO to have members of the
ISO technical committees participate in the standards
development work of the CEN/CENELEC had been refused. ANSI
reported that CEN agreed to joint review of work plans.

The US government and the EC Commission agreed to review the
effectiveness of these methods of transparency worked out
between CEN/CENELEC and ANSI.

Testing and Certification

For regulated products, on the date of implementation of EC
product directives, the European Community intends to allow
only the sale of such products that bear a CE mark of
conformity to EC essential requirements.  Regulated products
without this mark cannot be sold in the EC.

The ECE mark will signify that the regulated products have
complied with the EC essential requirements and will be
allowed free circulation in the EC.

The CE mark signifies that the product conforms with the
essential requirements in the EC directives in a manner
specified in the applicable EC product directive.

While many of these product directives rely on CEN/CENELEC
product standards, other standards may be recognized and in
some product directives adherence to standards are not
expected.

No mark is required for non-regulated products except those
agreed by a willing buyer and seller.

Additional marks will continue to be affixed to products as
"quality" marks signifying performance or safety levels more
stringent than that specified by the CE mark.  Absence of
those national "quality" marks does not affect the legal
right to market a product.

For the most part, the date of implementation of these EC
product directives is in 1992 but no later than January 1,
1993.  (Toys, pressure vessels and electromagnetic
compatibility are implemented in 1990 and 1991).

EC product directives covering products listed in the annex
specify the means of proving conformance.  These mandatory
procedures offer some flexibility to manufacturers to choose
among options to show compliance but the specific directive
dictates the type of conformance procedure and these
requirements must be met.

Proof of conformance requires that the CE mark be affixed to
the product.  Depending on the EC product directive, the CE
mark can be affixed by the manufacturer or an approved body.

Interpretation of essential requirements related to EC
product directives summarized on the previous pages and the
interpretation of compliance with European Norms or standards
generated by CEN/CENELEC rely upon approved bodies to perform
tests, certify compliance, audit quality control systems and
so on.

At this time, member state governments are the only entities
that can approve these testing and certifying bodies to
perform the services required in the EC directives.

The EC Commission states that approved bodies in the EC must
carry out the third party intervention in a non-
discriminatory manner.

At this time, member states will only approve entities to
perform services required by the EC directives that are
located within their national boundaries.  Member states also
are required to accept the approvals of all other member
states in the products covered by the directives.

Selected EC product directives rely on accreditation of
quality assurance techniques in manufacturing plants as the
means to show compliance with an essential requirement.
CEN/CENELEC has adopted EN29000 series standards on quality
assurance to advance harmonization.  EN29000 is the European
version of ISO 9000.

In like manner, EC testing labs, inspection and certifying
bodies follow EN45000 standards on establishing competence of
bodies.  CEN/CENELEC is developing sectoral elaborations for
these rules as well as EN29000.

It is EC Commission's recommendation that in the future
foreign bodies be approved to perform regulated activities
called for in the EC product directives outside the EC.  In
order to have any force in the marketplace, the EC Council
must adopt the EC Commission recommendation.  Council
adoption may come as soon as January 1990.

The EC Commission has recommended that foreign testing and
certifying bodies be required to satisfy the same criteria
for becoming an EC approving authority as is inherently
applied to the EC testing and certifying authorities.
Therefore, foreigners must be prepared to:

-guarantee adherence to the EC essential requirements

-adopt EN29000 and EN45000 series of standards as the basic
technical instruments for performing regulated activities.
(Any sectoral adaptations to these basic series developed by
the EC must also be complied with.)

-competence must be maintained on a continuous basis.

-guarantees must be developed for equivalent and equal access
to the market provide for mutual benefits under the systems.

In the case of foreign approvals the EC will look for a
national system that can guarantee that approval bodies meet
EC requirements.  This does not have to be the U.S.
government nor does it have to be a single system for all
products or approvals.

The EC Commission expects that the approved bodies notified
under the directives will carry out the negotiations with
third country entities to establish mutual recognition
agreements.  EC Council will approve these agreements before
they can be implemented to assure that the objectives of the
EC have been met.

All existing bilateral agreements between EC member state
testing and certifying bodies and third country bodies will
have to be transposed (renegotiated) as EC-wide bilateral
agreements when the EC product directives are implemented
under the conditions stated above including "mutual
benefits."

In addition to the CE mark, many EC directives require
additional product labels that give an EC contact point for
the manufacturer.  In virtually all directives, the European
standard developed by CEN/CENELEC carries additional weight
that aids the manufacturer to establish conformity to the
essential requirements in the EC product directive.

Office of European Community Affairs, International Trade
Administration, Washington D.C. 20230.

1992 Center in the U.S.

George Mason University Center

Focus on 1992

George Mason University's Center for European Community (EC)
Studies, which opened last month in Norfolk, Virginia, is no
ivory tower enterprise.  The Center was established with the
explicit purpose of providing the business community with
information and assistance in understanding developments in
European efforts to establish a single market by 1992.

GMU's designation as a European Documentation Center, by the
European Commission in Brussels, will help it to accomplish
this goal.  The Center will receive all EC official
publications and will have unlimited access to EC databases
in Brussels and Luxembourg.  With these resources, it will be
a unique information base for Northern Virginia and the
greater Washington area; both of which generate a strong
demand for international economic information.

The colleges of George Mason University will also benefit
from the center's resources, as well as its promotion of
research, conferences, and seminars on EC issues.  The
undertaking of collaberative research projects between
European and American academics will also benefit the rest of
the University.

Another GMU program of particular interest to exporters is
the Entrepreneurship Institute.  Established in 1986, the
institute has focused its efforts on encouraging
entrepreneurial approaches to business.  On the international
level, the institute aims to promote export expansion,
particularly amongst small, high-technology companies.  The
European center will give impetus to their efforts by
providing access to information about the latest developments
in the European market.

The EC Center will also house the headquarters of the
European Community Studies Association (ECSA), an association
of European scholars and researchers in the United States.
The organization held its first conference in May 1989 with
its second planned for May 1991.

European Community Studies, George Mason University, Suite
450, Quincy Street Station, 4001 North Fairfax Drive.

Predex Forecast

Update of a Ten-Year Forecast

Provided by Predex Corp.

The Rand

Ten years ago a client asked us to forecast the rand ten
years out.  Last March the Financial Mail reported the
results (see below), and wondered how the model, updated with
data of the past decade, would forecast the next ten years.
Under the conditions described below, this simple model sees
the rand recovering in 1990-91.

How bad can a worst-case scenario be?  Worse even than a
forecaster's wildest expectations.  A 10-year projection on
the rand, made in 1980 by U.S. currency analyst Charles
Ramond, plotted a series of alternative outcomes based on 12
different scenarios-and failed to come up with any estimate
as bad as reality.

Though Ramond, president of Predex Corporation, "oldest
independent forecaster of currencies," correctly interpreted
the trend, he failed to foresee the strength of the forces
working against the rand.  His worst-case prediction was
pitched at a rand of around US75 cents in 1988 - instead of
the 43 cents it actually averaged last year.

Why was reality so much worse than expected?

Within the confines of the model, two assumptions turned out
to be grossly understated.  The predictions thrown out by
what Ramond describes as a naive model were based on two
factors: the real price of gold (the price adjusted for US
inflation), and US inflation in relation to the SA inflation
rate.

When the forecast was written in 1980, says Ramond, the rand
had been worth between $1,15-$1,40 for most of 14 years.
"Inflation was raging worldwide, US long rates were nearing
20% and a Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman named Volcker was
about to throttle that inflation with the deepest US
recession since World War 2."

As a result of Volcker's success, Ramond was wrong in two of
three assumptions. Though he correctly predicted SA's
inflation rate was likely to be higher than that of the US if
it was not the same, he did not foresee:

-The real gold price falling, as it has uninterruptedly up
until the present; or

-The wide divergence between inflation rates in the US and
SA.

Ramond estimated the lowest year-on-year change in US CPI
would be 5%. "It actually reached 2% before rising again.
Similarly for SA, the highest CPI we assumed in any year was
14%-which it has exceeded for the past four years."

Factors not taken into account by the model, which exerted a
powerful influence on the rand in recent years, were capital
flight and credit sanctions.  The effect of these is
illustrated in the graph which carries a forecast based on
actual gold prices and relative inflation rates of the US and
SA, contrasted with what happened in the years to 1988. The
discrepancy is due to factors outside the model.

Crucial to the future course of the rand is the continuing
success of US monetary policy.

On this score Ramond has some reservations.  He says, in
a recent presentation on the US economy, present Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan referred to an (unidentified) economic
indicator which has been flashing warnings of inflation for
several years.  And, as a result, he has been attempting to
choke back growth in M2 since last March.

Ramond believes Greenspan's attempts to hold down
inflationary forces may be undermined by monetisation of
debts of the devasted savings and loan industry.

What is bad news for the US may then bring a measure of good
to SA.

Political Risk Letter

Country Updates

Political and Economic Forecasts from PRS, a division of IBC
USA.

Changes in Eastern Europe

This article is a summary of a special report in the
December 1989 issue of Country Forecasts, which contains
detailed analysis and comparative rankings of the countries
of Eastern Europe.

Irreversible Momentum for Economic Liberalization:

The introduction of market mechanism in the Soviet Union and
most of the other Eastern European states is irreversible.
At the same time, the movement toward open economies will be
slow and tortuous.  Many pockets of political and
bureaucratic opposition remain to disrupt reform, so that the
rules of the game will be altered frequently.  The key
elements will be ability of Gorbachev to remain in power in
the Soviet Union and the progress made in East Germany toward
economic coordination with West Germany.

Political reform, on the other hand, will proceed at a much
slower pace, with movement toward liberalization intermixed
with repression.  Political liberalization may even be
stymied, particularly if nationality conflict increases
substantially in the Soviet Union.  However, even a return to
widespread political repression, would only slow, not
reverse, economic liberalization.

Business Prospects Are Improved, But Limited:

Within the next 3 to 5 years the risks of unexpected and
unusual costs outweigh the potential for profits except for
the sale of products and services that improve the base for
long-range economic development.

Key Risk Factors:

-A chronic shortage of foreign currency.

-Poor training, experience, and attitude among both labor and
management.

-An entrenched bureaucracy resistant to change.

These problems are similar to those that plague most Third
World countries.  The difference with Eastern Europe is that
its economies, while under-developed, contain much more
potential than those of Africa and Latin America.  The
workforce is relatively educated and the underclass is
relatively small.  In addition, the economic development of
Eastern Europe is a much higher priority to the countries of
Western Europe than economic development in Latin America or
sub-Sahara Africa is to the industrialized countries.

Better business prospects are by no means certain.  In any
case, the opportunities will not be uniform throughout
Eastern Europe. Continued improvement depends on several
economic and political conditions, including avoidance of
nationallity conflicts and territorial disputes; continued
cooperation between the United States and the USSR; the
coming to power of competent leadership in Eastern Europe;
and adequate aid and investment from OECD countries.

If these conditions were to develop, the economies of most
Eastern European countries could be equal in strength and
business potential to some of the newly industrialized
countries by the year 2000.

Pre-1945 Economic Performance Will Be A Guide To The
Future:

In estimating the varying strengths and weaknesses of the
economies of Eastern Europe, the health of the economies
prior to World War II is a better guideline than the current
political attitudes toward reform.  It is easier to change
political leaders, official government policies, and even
ideology than the attitudes of potential business managers,
the discipline and skill of the labor force, and economic
infrastructure.  In addition to these crucial long-term
economic factors, it is also necessary to look at each
country's debt, hard currency positions, and experience with
private market mechanism during the last forty years.  Based
on these political, economic, and financial considerations
Eastern European countries are ranked below-from the best to
worst-with respect to climate for international business over
the next ten years:

(1) East Germany
(2) Czechoslovakia
(3) Hungary
(4) Poland
(5) Romania
(6) USSR
(7) Bulgaria
(8) Yugoslavia

The events in Eastern Europe will have a variety of effects
on other parts of the world.  Most important is in Western
Europe, especially West Germany. German firms already have a
head start on trade and investment in Eastern Europe, and
will be able to move quickly to take advantage of the new
opportunities in the region.  The movement toward EC 1992
will not be significantly slowed by recent events, as long as
the question of German reunification does not become a
stumbling block.  Firms from North America and Japan will
find it much more difficult than European firms to capitalize
on developments on the continent.

Bulgaria-Slow Economic Reform

After resisting pressure for reform from both the Soviet
Union and within the country, Bulgaria's long-term leader,
Tidor Zhivkov, stepped down in November.  The government had
permitted more dissent in recent months despite occasional
crackdowns, and had allowed some private activity in the
service sector at the urging of the Soviet Union.  However,
events in East Germany in November appear to have convinced
the leadership that Zhivkov had to go and that economic
reform had to be pursued more vigorously.

Poor economic conditions and resistance from within the
bureaucracy and party will limit the speed of economic
reform.  The new leadership itself is drawn from those who
were influential in the Zhivkov regime.  The new Communist
party leader is Petar Mladenov who was the Foreign Minister
udner the previous regime for 18 years.  The most crucial
factor, however, will be the degree of economic progress in
the more reformist Eastern Europe.  Bulgaria will continue to
follow rather than lead in dismantling the state control of
its economy.

Brazil-Collor Slight Favorite

The first state of the voting has left a clear choice for the
Brazilian electorate which votes on December 17th.  The
front-runner in the first round was the forty year old former
state governor, Fernando Collor de Mello, who will face the
labor leader Luis Inacio da Silva, popularly referred to as
Lula. Collor is advocating privatization and austerity and
openness to international business while Lula is calling for
strong central government control, land reform, and less
openness to international business.

With a television debate and stronger party base for Lula,
Collor will have a tough time winning the election despite
his strong showing in the first election.  However, support
from the center and right along with his youth should enable
him to win a close race. Because the two houses of Congress
are likely to be hopelessly divided among several parties,
whoever wins the presidency is likely to pursue policies less
extreme than the positions they currently advocate.
Nevertheless, a victory by Collor is much preferred by the
domestic and international business community.

China-Business Conditions Decline

Despite an attempt to attract new foreign investment with
promises of more open-door policies, the government will be
unable to reverse declines touched off by the student
uprising in June 1989.  Foreign exchange reserves are
drastically down, from $19 billion in April to $14 billion in
June.  Foreign debt service payments to reach peak in the
1990-1992 period, although the debt service ratio is still
low compared with other Third World countries.  China will be
paying higher interest rates because of a reduced credit
rating by international financial institutions.

Japanese businesses have maintained their investments in
China, but Japanese banks are not likely to put in more
money.  Several joint-venture automobile factories have been
forced to close because of reduced domestic demand and
bureaucratic inaction.  More restrictions on imports can be
expected to protect foreign reserves.

Tough austerity measures have slowed growth and halted what
was becoming a runaway inflation.  However, popular
dissatisfaction with the measures will require tight
political control, which will further reduce worker morale.
The replacement of troops with police at key points in
Beijing will likely be followed by other symbolic acts on the
political front, such as the removal of martial law, in order
to reduce human rights pressure.  Business interests have
lost influence among the leadership, and the ascendance of
the hardliners is likely to last for some time.

Shipping Regulations

Report on the 1984 Shipping Act

The following has been abstracted from an executive summary
of the Section 18 Report on The Shipping Act of 1984,
published by the Federal Maritime Commission, September 1989.

Overview

Under the 1984 Act's new agreement review process and
standard, the Commission experienced (a) an increase in the
average number of agreements and modifications filed each
year; (b) a reduction in average processing time per
agreement; and (c) a decline in the cost of proceedings
before the Commission.  These changes freed more Commission
resources for expanded enforcement actions which brought
about significant increases in penalty collections.

These procedural improvements also enabled the Commission to
devote more time to address foreign government restraints on
shipping.  The Commission instituted more proceedings under
section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, since enactment
of the 1984 Act than at any other comparable period of time.
These Commission actions have had a positive influence on
trading conditions in the US foreign commerce.

The 1984 Act's reforms did not bring about the negative
consequences that some observers predicted.  The creation of
"superconferences" and the increase in rationalization
agreements did not result in sharp rate increases,
curtailment of shipping services, or loss of independent
carrier competition.  The 1984 Act did not have a significant
impact on rate levels, service frequency, and the strength of
independent competition.  The US trades remained open and
competitive.

The popularity of the IA and the service contract provisions
of the 1984 Act led to a disagreement about whether common
carriage obligations should be relaxed.  In particular, major
shippers have called for a greater role for contract
carriage.  These shippers would like Congress to establish a
clear distinction between common carriage under tariff rates
and carriage under service contracts.  They would (a) require
that the terms of service contracts be kept confidential; and
(b) prohibit conferences from restricting the right to their
members to enter into service contracts.

Carriers, on the other hand, assert that these steps would
ultimately undermine the tariff system, the conference
system, and the principle of common carriage in ocean
shipping.  Instead, they advocate continued filing and
publication of the "essential terms" of service contracts and
the availability of those terms to similarly situated
shippers.

The Impact of the 1984 Act on the International Shipping
Industry

As required by the 1984 Act, the Commission collected and
analyzed information on the Act's impact on rates, service,
independent carriers, and regulatory proceedings.  In
addition, the Commission conducted a series of annual surveys
to solicit the views of the maritime industry on the
consequences of the 1984 Act.  These survey results were
supplemented by policy papers presented by industry
representatives serving on the Section 18 Study Advisory
Committee.

The major conclusions to be drawn from this information are
as follows.

Data and Analysis on the Impact of the 1984 Act

(1) The Commission experienced an increase in the average
number of carrier agreements and modifications filed each
year, and a reduction in the average processing time per
agreement.

(2) Changes in the agreement review process and standard of
review made easier the creation of superconferences and the
use of conference intermodal authority.

(3) The 45-day agreement effectiveness provision in the 1984
Act decreased the average processing time for agreements to
become effective to less than one-third of that required for
approval prior to the 1984 Act.  The total cost of major
proceedings declined as well.

(4) Following implementation of the 1984 Act, there was a
decline in the number of major proceedings before the
Commission coupled with a modest increase in the average
length of those proceedings.  The Commission was able,
therefore, to concentrate its resources on more complex
proceedings and other issues, including enforcement cases and
strategies.

(5) Independent action rates and service contracts expanded
the commercial options available to the shipping public.  In
some trades, port-to-port tariff rates became the exception
rather than the rule.

(6) The main factors that explain freight rate structures
(value, tonnage, distance, direction, stowage, refrigeration)
did not change appreciably as a result of the 1984 Act.
Where change was noted - in the significance of the direction
variable (i.e., outbound US versus inbound US)- the most
likely cause appeared to be trade flow imbalances, rather
than provisions of the 1984 Act.

(7) Quarterly rate data on the major moving commodities in 18
US trades between 1976 and 1988 indicate that fluctuations in
the supply of and demand for liner shipping services - not IA
and service contract provisions -were the basic cause of the
rate changes that occurred after implementation of the 1984
Act.

(8) A comparative study of rate stability in 18 US trades
before and after implementation of the 1984 Act indicates
that only six US/Pacific trades experienced a decrease in
rate stability.  However, that decrease began in 1982,
suggesting that changes in the international economy were the
primary cause.

(9) A comparison of shipping capacity growth rates before and
after implementation of the 1984 Act showed that, of the six
US trades studied (North Europe, the North Pacific, the South
Pacific, Italy, Australia and Brazil), three trades exhibited
no dramatic changes in growth; two trades showed significant
increases in capacity growth; and one trade, the Australia
trade, showed a decrease in capacity growth.  These results
suggest that the prevailing economic conditions in specific
trades, rather than particular provisions of the 1984 Act,
were the important influences on the level of capacity
provided to shippers.

(10) A comparison of the largest US trade, the Pacific trade,
with the largest non-US trade, North Europe/Far East,
involving nine basic service parameters, revealed broadly
similar patterns of change during 1984 to 1988 period.  These
results further support the view that factors other than the
1984 Act were mainly responsible for changes in service
levels.

(11) Data from the six trades studied indicate that no
contraction in the average number of direct ship calls
occurred between 1984-1988.  In fact, the average number of
calls made annually in the US port regions studied increased
slightly.

(12) As inland transport costs declined relative to all-water
transport costs, service concentration at the US range
closest to the foreign destination increased.

(13) The relative strength of independent carriers, as
reflected in the proportion of total shipping capacity
provided, has changed little since the implementation of the
1984 Act.  In some individual trades, such as the North
Europe trade, independents made significant market share
inroads.

(14) Independent carriers made significant gains in terms of
tonnage carried in the largest US trade, i.e., the Pacific
trade.

(15) Comparisons of value-to-tonnage ratios between
conference and independent carriers show that in most US
trades, conference cargo mixes yield a higher ratio.  But
figures also show that independent carriers reduced the
difference between their ratio and those of the conferences
in most US trades.  Independents appear to be increasing the
proportion of high-valued cargo in their cargo mix.

(16) The Brazil trade, with its bilateral maritime agreement,
revenue pooling agreements, and cargo reservation laws, is
characterized by high conference market share with no
independent action on rates.

Industry Views on the 1984 Shipping Act

The views offered by various industry segments affected by
the 1984 Act varied widely.  They varied both across
industries and within each industry.  A presentation of each
industry group's views is contained in Chapter 7.  To the
extent that consensus exists on some key points, the
following broad conclusions can be drawn:

(1) There is industry support for retaining an "open"
conference system in the US trades.  Alternative approaches,
such as prohibiting conferences or allowing "closed"
conferences, had little support.

(2) A majority of the international ocean shipping industry
supported the proposition that tariffs continue to be filed
with, and enforced by, the FMC.

(3) The revised agreement review process in the 1984 Act has
proven beneficial.

(4) The more controversial 1984 Act provisions are (a) the
mandatory independent action provision, and (b) the provision
permitting service contracts.  Generally, shippers tended to
endorse shorter notice periods for IA and the extension of IA
to service contracts, while carriers tended to prefer the
opposite.

Volume and Mass Tariff System

(1) In response to Commission surveys, neither users nor
providers of tariffs favored a system of tariffs based solely
on volume and mass (i.e., weight or measure) or a
freight-all-kinds system.

(2) An analysis of the economic implications of adopting a
system of tariffs based on volume and mass suggests that such
a system could cause distortions in the existing
transportation system.

(3) Volume and mass tariffs might lead to a simpler system,
and therefore require less regulatory oversight.  Such a
system could also:

(a) reduce the movement of low-valued cargo in the US trades;

(b) increase the impact of IA on conferences;

(c) create distortions in the choice of ports if Canada, for
example, does not impose a similar system; and

(d) complicate intermodal ratemaking.

(4) Based on both data and theory, it is difficult to make a
case for adopting a system of tariffs based on volume and
mass of shipment.

(5) There was some support, especially among shippers, for a
lump-sum per container system.  This suggests support a more
simplified tariff structure.

(6) There is little data to support the contention that the
current rate structure results from conferences' exercise of
monopoly power.

Antitrust Immunity for Ports and Marine Terminal Operators

(1) The regulation of marine terminals was a reaction to the
pricing policies of railroad-owned marine terminals and their
effects on competition among shippers lines.  The current
system of terminal control and coordination by state-
sponsored public port authorities does not present similar
threats to competition.

(2) The need for antitrust immunity to lessen excessive
competition depends on one's theoretical point of view.  The
neoclassical economic interpretation concludes that there is
no strong case for antitrust immunity.  On the other hand,
the Austrian economic view states that a case can be made for
granting antitrust immunity.

(3) Public or quasi-public agencies are not motivated solely
by economic considerations, and antitrust principles based on
the traditional ideas of competition may not be fully
applicable.  Interport conferences that include members from
two or more states generally are not successful in reducing
interport competition.

(4) There is no clear public benefit in allowing private
marine terminal operators to collectively fix rates and
charges within a port.  Granting antitrust protection for
such purposes may not be necessary or economically
justifiable.

(5) The need to provide antitrust immunity for port
authorities and private terminal operators to allow "parity"
with carrier conferences is questionable.  Carriers'
bargaining strength over terminal leases or services is
generally due to port-related geographical and logistical
factors and the availability of alternative ports-of-call,
not to the carriers' 1984 Act antitrust immunity.

(6) Public port authorities may enjoy protection from US
antitrust laws even without 1984 Act antitrust immunity.
However, not all ports may enjoy the same level of immunity.
This could result in a nonuniform application of antitrust
immunity.

(7) Whether to retain the current 1984 Act antitrust immunity
provisions dealing with marine terminals, or to limit them
only to public port authorities, or to remove them
altogether, requires a value judgment that balances all
regulatory concerns.  These include economic analysis,
antitrust policy, state and federal regulatory
responsibilities, and established industry practices.

FMC Tariff Filing and Enforcement

(1) The historical record reflects a continuing reliance on
tariff filing and enforcement.

(2) Based on annual survey responses, a majority of the
shipping industry favor the continuation of the existing
tariff filing and enforcement system.

(3) Surveys indicate that carriers believe they should
continue to have the right to file excepted commodity rates,
but oppose IA on these rates.  Shippers are divided on the
filing issue but favor mandatory IA on excepted commodity
rates.

(4) Surveys of the tariff filing and enforcement practices of
foreign governments reveal a trend towards increased tariff
regulation.

(5) The commission would find it difficult to meet its
legislatively mandated responsibilities in the absence of
tariff requirements.

(6) Of the policy options considered, only the existing
system ensures a nondiscriminatory ocean transportation
system.

(7) The existing tariff filing and enforcement mechanism, in
an open conference environment, can promote market
efficiency, ensure fair treatment of shippers by carriers,
and preserve just competition between carriers.

Summaries of Supplementary Reports

Service Contracts

(1) Service contracts have had a significant impact upon the
maritime community.  During the period of study, carriers and
conferences filed 17,103 service contracts and substantial
amounts of cargo moved under those contracts.

(2) Sixty-nine percent of service contract filings were by
independents (or individual conference carriers), and 31
percent were by conferences.

(3) Evergreen Line filed more service contracts (2,333) than
any other carrier or conference.  The Asia North America
Eastbound Rate Agreement ("ANERA") had the second highest
total (1,317), and the North Europe-U.S. Atlantic Conference
was third (1,253).

(4) There was a wide variation in rates between service
contracts and tariffs for similar commodities carried by
conferences.

(5) Industry opinions are mixed on both effects of service
contracts and the extent to which the service contract
provisions of the 1984 Act should be amended.

(a) Since 1986, carriers have increasingly indicated that
service contracts have had a positive impact on their firms.

(b) Shippers, especially those who have successfully
negotiated them, view service contracts favorably.

(c) Majority support existed in the maritime community for
continuing to require that the essential terms of service
contracts be made publicly available.

However, a significant number of shippers prefer confidential
contracts.

(d) Carriers oppose, while shippers support requiring
independent action on service contracts.

Independent Action

(1) IA allows conference members to offer lower rates and
more responsive service to shippers.  IA enhances the
competitiveness and flexibility of conferences because the
members are able to compete both among themselves and with
independents.  If intraconference competition becomes too
intense, the ability of the conference to stabilize rates can
be threatened.  Although mandatory independent action may
have expedited changes in tariff rates, market conditions
determined their ultimate levels.

(2) The large number of IAs taken by two conferences in the
Pacific trades, the Transpacific Westbound Rate Agreement
("TWRA") AND ANERA, may reflect the level of competition from
independents in those trades.  The recent decrease in the use
of IAs by TWRA carriers may be explained by growing US
exports that have served to reduce excess shipping capacity.
Slowing imports may be the reason for the growing use of IA
by ANERA carriers.

(3) Mandatory independent action in conference agreements was
not subject to as much debate as was the length of the
maximum IA notice period.  The current ten-day maximum period
was opposed by carriers and supported by shippers.  While the
ten-day notice period may have facilitated carrier rate
reductions, it did not cause them.  The cause was more likely
overtonnaging.

(4) Service contract rates were affected by IA on tariff
rates because tariff rates were often the basis for
negotiating service contract rates.

(5) It is difficult to formulate specific conclusions
concerning IA on service contracts (i.e., a member's right to
enter into individual service contracts), because of the
minimal amount of such activity under the 1984 Act.  The
impact of service contract IA on the conference's ability to
establish uniform rates in an overtonnaged market could last
longer than for IA on tariffs, because a service contract
effectively diverts at least a portion of a shipper's cargo
from other carriers for the duration of the contract (rather
than for a single voyage).

Technical Adjustments, Clarifications, and Anomalies

The Commission has identified certain provisions of the 1984
Act which are unclear or might create unintended effects.
these provisions are discussed in the Section 18 Report's
final chapter.

KENNEDY, D'AMATO ADD LIBYA TO IRAN OIL
SANCTIONS BILL
Bill lacks the real teeth that proponents claim

The Senate on December 20 passed the Iran Oil Sanctions Act of 1995
(S. 1228), a bill sponsored by Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) to
impose discretionary sanctions on  foreign companies that invest over
$40 million in the Iranian oil industry in any year.  The bill is a
watered-down incarnation of other foreign sanctions bills advanced by
D'Amato earlier in the year, and is unlikely to be enforced frequently
enough to ignite disputes with U.S. trading partners.  In a last-minute
maneuver, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) made Libya an additional
target of the sanctions bill.

The Senate passed the bill with the blessing of the Clinton administration,
which had opposed previous D'Amato proposals to cut off all U.S. trade
with foreign companies that pursue trade with Iran. The purpose of these
proposals was to bring bout an international embargo against Iran by
forcing foreign companies to choose between trading with the U.S. and
trading with Iran.

The new bill is much narrower-both in terms of the activities that trigger
the sanctions and the sanctions themselves. The administration would be
obliged to impose at least one of the following sanctions against foreign
companies that invest over $40 million in the Iranian oil industry in one
year:

*  Denial of U.S. Export-Import Bank assistance;
* Denial of export licenses for products to be shipped to sanctioned
persons;
* Prohibition on loan assistance from U.S. financial institutions
exceeding $10 million in any 12 month period; and
* Ban on the operation of financial institutions that contribute to Iran's oil
development

According to Senator D'Amato, several major European corporations will
be affected by the measure.  These companies include but are not limited
to Repsol-Spain, Agip-Italy, Total-France, Petrofina-Belgium,
OMV-Austria, and Veba-Germany.

According to Washington, D.C. attorney Eric Hirschhorn, a partner at
Winston and Strawn, the bill represents a victory for the Clinton
administration, which can now avoid the political heat of vetoing a bill
that purports to punish terrorist states. "They were going to go off a cliff
on this one," said Hirschhorn, "this is a short drop compared from the
legislation that started.  Do I like it?  No.  It is a pointless exercise and
may cause retaliation from overseas, but it could have been a lot worse."

Here's what the bill does not do and where it has been narrowed:

* It only applies to "investments" (not just trade) of over $40 million in a
12 month period;
* It no longer denies entry into the United States of executives who work
for companies subject to the bill's sanctions; and
* It no longer prohibits the importation into the United States of items
from companies subject to sanctions

The amended version of the bill was fittingly passed on the eve of the
seventh anniversary of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland.  "Despite U.N. economic sanctions which have been
in force since 1992, the Government of Libya has refused to turn over
suspects, and the two suspects remain in Libya under the protection of
Colonel Qadhafi," said Kennedy on the Senate floor when introducing his
amendment.  As with Iran, the sanctions will not prohibit foreign
companies from doing business in Libya.

Hill sources claim that the House will consider similar legislation but
may attempt to make it stricter, most likely by lowering $40 million
trigger and by including import sanctions against any foreign company
that trades with, not just makes investments in, Iran.

But any attempts to beef up the bill may be more trouble than they are
worth. Administration sources say that though the administration was
originally not very excited about the bill, the final product is about the
type of bill they expected, and is one they will support.  Further, the
administration expects that the House version will closely resemble the
Senate bill.

CWC-FREE AT LAST!
Senate expected to ratify by late spring '96

Responding to pressure from exporters, the  Clinton administration and
the press, Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) has agreed to consider allowing
Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty, a
ground-breaking arms control agreement that Helms has kept bottled up
for months in the Senate Foreign Relations committee, which he heads.
Helms was keeping the CWC, along with other critical foreign policy
items-like ambassadorial nominations and the START II treaty-hostage to
his plans to downsize the State Department and its affiliated agencies, the
Agency for International Development and the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency.  It was unclear whether Helms had secured
concessions from the Clinton administration in return for his about face.

In a brief statement, Helms asked that the treaty be placed on the Senate
calendar by May 1 unless his committee reports it out before then.
Furthermore, he pledged to begin committee hearings on the treaty in
February.  Although Helms in the past has pilloried the treaty for weak
enforcement provisions and the possibility of non-compliance by Russia,
his committee will almost certainly deliver the treaty to the Senate floor
with a recommendation for ratification.

Republican presidential front-runner Bob Dole, eager to show deft
foreign affairs leadership, promised speedy Senate action on the treaty.
Ratification, which requires approval by two-thirds of the Senate, should
be a mere formality.

Reaction from industry was swift.  "We finally got a date certain," said
Mike Walls of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA).  Fred
Webber, CMA president, applauded the move: "[t]he Senate has cleared a
major hurdle and opened the way for the United States to join 44 other
nations in ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention early next year,"
he said in a press release.  "We are, today, one step closer to realizing the
treaty's goal for a future free of chemical weapons."

BXA gearing up for implementing regulations

Imminent ratification set off sirens at the Commerce Department's
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA), which must coordinate treaty
compliance with U.S. chemical companies.  Larry Christensen, BXA's
regulatory guru, said that his reg-drafting team will step up its CWC work
in January and February. Christensen's office must churn out a set of
regulations that mirror the CWC's host record keeping and reporting
requirements.  Christensen said his goal is to finish the regulations
quickly to allow industry to gear up for compliance.  The sample
compliance forms that BXA has already circulated have drawn a
favorable response from chemical companies.

Had Helms not relinquished his control over CWC, U.S. producers would
be burdened with controls parallel to those that will be put on pariah
nations such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea.  Of equal
importance, the United States will now be a participant, rather than an
observer, on inspection teams.  United States officials will also be eligible
to hold positions on the CWC's Secretariat when it is established.

The treaty is widely recognized as one of most comprehensive arms
control agreements ever negotiated. It not only bans chemical weapons
,but also asserts strict control over the production and trade of chemical
warfare precursors, which include commonly traded commercial
chemicals used to make consumer goods such as clothing and paint. The
jurisdiction of the treaty is so broad, in fact, that its compliance
requirements bind companies that do not produce chemicals but merely
use them as inputs in manufacturing.

Politically, the newly pronounced action on CWC will save the United
States from international embarrassment-it was the United States that
initially led the charge for the treaty.  Once the Senate gives its
ratification, other countries will be sure to follow, pushing to ratification
total safely above the 65 countries needed for the treaty to enter into
force.  Currently, 43 countries have ratified the treaty.

But the challenge of ratification is trifling compared to the treaty's
calling: Stemming the spread of chemical weapons.  As calamities in the
Middle East and Japan over the past decade have shown, chemical
weapons are the equal opportunity equalizer of poor, technologically
backward terrorists and two-bit dictators the world over.  The CWC,
despite its lofty aims and well-conceived provisions, can no more hope to
stop rogues from acquiring chemical weapons precursors than to prevent
them from acquiring the rudimentary scientific expertise to convert them
into chemical weapons.  The hope, however, is that the treaty will act a
deterrent by strengthening the chorus of international condemnation of
chemical weapons.

ENCRYPTION AT A CROSSROADS-THE FIRST OF MANY
Industry calling for more liberal export criteria

Industry and government officials went at it again over encryption export
criteria this month at a December 5 meeting at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST).  After the government bureaucrats
and industry techies had said their piece, and the banter was finished, it
was not difficult to tell exactly what came out of the meeting. Though
there was an admirable exchange of thoughts and comments between
government and industry, one left the NIST center feeling that the whole
day there was a fruitless exercise with little impact on how the
government will control the export of sensitive encryption software.

According to one industry source who requested anonymity, despite the
change in the proposal's language (see last month's Practitioner for the
most recent draft), the government is basically sticking with its August 17
proposal as the answer to the matter and will not accept anything else.
"Basically, that is the deal" said the source.  The two sides will certainly
clash again before any final resolution is reached.

64 Bits Just Won't Do It

The most critical issue remains the number of key length bits that the
government will allow producers to export.  The debate centers around
requirement number seven of the government's latest draft for key
escrow encryption export criteria.  Requirement number seven reads as
follows:  "7.  The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall use
an unclassified encryption algorithm with a key length not to exceed
sixty-four (64) bits."

Industry is becoming increasingly more insistent that the government
increase the permissible export level to at least 80 bits, if not more.  To
put all this in context, it is important to understand the industry standard
for judging encryption.  Industry generally considers 40 bit length
encryption as "weak" encryption; 64 bit encryption is "good" encryption;
and "strong" encryption is considered to be encryption key lengths of 80
bits or more.  This includes Skipjack, 80 bits, and triple DES, with
approximately 112 bits depending on which operational mode you use.
Note that since the French broke the Netscape Navigator's 40 bit
encryption system in November, 40 bit encryption has not even been
considered "weak" encryption by many.

This all brings us back to industry's request to increase the level of
encryption key length bits that can be exported.  Banks, for instance, need
to protect millions of dollars in overseas financial transactions. The
chemical and petroleum industry have similar interests.  Though the two
sides can discuss the exact procedures regarding how a key escrow agent
will interface with government law enforcement agents, and other
logistical issues, the government, the National Security Agency in
particular, will not show any public willingness to go above  64 bits.

Other problems with the 64 bit level involve issues concerning
competitiveness rather than security.  For instance, under the latest draft's
requirements, U.S. industry will be at a great competitive disadvantage
when facing competition from unescrowed systems with over 64 bits
manufactured overseas.  Moreover, there has been a greater demand for
triple DES, a feature that is prohibited under requirement number eight in
the latest draft.

At least one industry source in the know, however, indicated that
government officials have privately expressed a willingness to consider
larger symmetric encryption key lengths.  This is conditioned, of course,
that the encryption system and the accompanying escrow arrangements
are hardware-based products that are designed to make them
tamper-proof.  Trusted Information Systems (TIS), of Glenwood, MD has
requested that the government consider for export a hardware-based
system with key lengths up to 128 bits when it is accompanied with such
a tamper-proof system.  TIS claims that the government has expressed a
willingness to discuss the request, but has not gone much further than
that.

As the debate over key length intensifies, it is becoming more apparent
that 64 bits will not satisfy industry's concerns.  In any event, encryption
software producers may be well advised to take the best arrangement they
can get from the government and start marketing their products to see if
they will actually be able to sell them.

European Officials Meet to Discuss Encryption Issue

In a related development, European industry representatives and
European government officials met at a two day conference in
mid-December to devise a global encryption policy.  It was the first time
leading European business associations and government officials
discussed the growing number of encrypted electronic messages sent
internationally.  At the conference, officials analyzed the use and
safekeeping of keys to encrypted messages, and the conditions under
which governments will be allowed to access the messages.

The two sides also attempted to assign the liability in the case of misuse
or material loss  under any encryption methods.  OECD government
officials participated in the conference along with representatives of the
International Chamber of Commerce, the Business and Industry Advisory
Committee of the OECD, and information technology associations
covering Europe, Canada, Japan, and the United States.

Both U.S. government and industry officials would be well advised to
keep abreast of their European counterparts' activities.  Once all sides
have finished their bantering, any rules adopted in the United States will
need to be consistent with procedures overseas.  If U.S. criteria end up
being more liberal than other country's criteria, it will be of little use
because U.S. producers will have nowhere to sell their product.  If U.S.
criteria is too stringent, then U.S. producers will not be able to compete.

WASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT (A.K.A. "NEW FORUM") TO TAKE
PLACE OF COCOM
The United States and its allies commence post cold war export control
regime

The United States and 27 other nations, on December 19 reached final
agreement on a new trade control agreement to restrict the transfer of
weapons to rogue states.  The  group includes Russia and nations of the
former Soviet Union.  The arrangement was first called the "New Forum"
when its countries announced in September that they had agreed in
principle on a regime.  But naming an international regime "New Forum"
begged the question: What do you call the treaty ten years from now?
The Old Forum, The Aging Forum, The Adolescent Forum?

This must have been on the top of the drafters' minds as they crossed the
t's and dotted the i's on the new export control regime's final declaration.
Now given the lengthy title of The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export
Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies,
the agreement will replace the now-defunct Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The agreement is known simply
as The Wassenaar Arrangement: a ten word title does not easily lend
itself to an acronym.

The length of the treaty's title was almost as long as the text of its final
declaration.  It is obvious from the declaration's few sentences that there
is more work to be done, said one administration source.  The declaration
only named the member countries and announced that each of the
countries would submit initial elements of the new arrangement to their
respective governments for approval.  The declaration also established a
preparatory committee that will begin work in January 1996.  The
Secretariat will be located in Vienna, Austria, and the first plenary
meeting will be in Vienna on April 2 and 3, 1996.

Impact for shippers

Though the administration can declare victory for the agreement, there is
little practical impact for exporters.  The agreement does not provide a
specific list of countries to whom members cannot ship goods.  Rather,
the agreement prohibits the shipment of arms and dual-use items to the
four generally recognized pariah states: Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and
Libya.  But even these seemingly politically uncontroversial parties are
not named in writing.  It is difficult to fathom member countries agreeing,
much less committing, to prohibit exports to other countries.

No list of controlled goods, well there is a list, it just is not public.

Enforcement mechanism: The Wassenaar Arrangement (one Freudian
slip and it's the Weimar Arrangement) lacks the type of system under
COCOM where member countries reviewed sensitive exports to pariah
countries.   Though this might change, there is no strong enforcement
mechanism as of yet.

State Department officials hail the agreement as a long overdue
replacement of COCOM, and as an agreement more suitable and
responsive to the post-cold war world.  The arrangement will aim to
respond to new security threats posed by rogue countries.  Indeed, a
central part of the regime is its members' commitment to stop the
acquisition of armaments and sensitive dual-use items by such countries.

Building on the lessons of the Iraq war, the Wassenaar Arrangement
seeks to prevent the accumulations of conventional arms around the
world.  "The Iraq war taught us that indiscriminate exports of
conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use technologies can pose
serious threats to our interests, foreign policy goals, and to international
security," said a State Department fact sheet.

Little burden on exporters

The Wassenaar Arrangement will require exporters to furnish little, if
any, additional information, said a State Department official.  Though
there may be some items that will require reporting in the future, for the
time being most of the information will be captured through
congressional reporting requirements, the licensing process, and
Shipper's Export Declarations.  There may be a very small set of general
license items that will have to be reported in the future. High
performance computers, for example, are one likely target of the regime's
reporting requirements.

Any new reporting requirements will be published in the Federal Register
by the Bureau of Export Administration.  These new regulations will
most likely require shippers to send in a summary of the designated items
on a periodic basis (e.g. quarterly). The Wassenaar Arrangement's
dual-use and munitions list essentially parallel U.S. law, so there is really
no need for exporters to be aware of additional lists.

The central goal of these new reporting requirements is for each member
nation to have information at its disposal to share with other member
countries.  The regime provides  a context where countries will be privy
to information to which they previously did not have access.

Administration cautiously optimistic on regime

The regime meets the Clinton administration's goals of moving forward
and beginning cooperative efforts with other countries.  Administration
officials are generally pleased with the results, though they candidly
acknowledge that they would have preferred a setup that featured
stronger restraint provisions and more mechanisms for openness and
transparency.  In any event, sources say, the Wassenaar Arrangement will
provide a context and mechanism where such matters can be debated at
greater length.  And debated they will surely be.

ANTICIPATING THE FINAL FORMAT OF NEW BXA
REGULATIONS

While it may cripple national parks and museums and delay issuance of
government paychecks and entitlements, the federal shutdown has not
blanketed the dank halls of the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)
in a black haze of dormancy.  Nope, as this Practitioner goes to press,
BXA's regulations policy group is working away, churning through
interagency comments, to bring you the revised version of the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) by January 1996, as well as trying to
hammer out the much-anticipated computer decontrol that President
Clinton announced on October 7, 1995.  Because the government is
closed and official meetings between important inter-agency players are
hamstrung, these regulatory changes are not expected in the Federal
Register before the end of the year, and may even not be out until much
later.

A sign of recent progress, however, did appear in the mailboxes of the
ever-shrinking ranks of Distribution Holders in the form of a December
15, 1995 letter from Acting Office of Export Licensing (OEL) Director
Eileen M. Albanese.  The letter authorized DL holders to adopt the major
reforms in computer export controls and raise the level of computer
eligibility on their special licenses.

Using the grouping of countries that President Clinton gave, the
following is a breakdown of how the countries will be grouped:

* Country Group A-no CTP restrictions:  Japan, U.S., Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, The
Holy See, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the U.K.;

* Group B-CTP up to 10,000 Mtops:  Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Brunei,
Chile, Colombia, The Czech Republic, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Hungary,
Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Poland, Peru, Philippines,
Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea,
Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela; and

* Group C-up to 2,000 Mtops, and for civil end-users only, up to 7,000
Mtops are permitted under the Distribution License, as long as shippers
meet certain conditions and the procedures are updated appropriately in
the Internal Control Program:  Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola,
Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, India, Israel, Kuwait, Morocco,
Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates,
Vanuatu and Yemen.

These conditions are similar to the supercomputer safeguards plan from
the current regulations and are as follows:

For all three groups-(1) No physical or computational access may be
granted to nationals of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria,
Sudan, and Somalia.  (2) Appropriate measures and checks must be
established to ensure that physical and computational access to the
computer and computer using facility will be limited to authorized
persons.  (3) The computer may not be used for military (Weapons of
Mass Destruction), cryptography, or clandestine activities.  (4)
Appropriate monitoring of the use of the computer (any indications of
improper or unauthorized use or requests for runs will be promptly
reported to the government of the importing country).

* For Group A-No reexport outside Group A.
* For Group B and C-No reexport or intra-country transfer without prior
written authorization from the Bureau of Export Administration.
* For Group C-Security measures will be established to protect the
computer against theft or unauthorized use at all times.

The current regulations, which prevent delivery of higher level computers
for destinations not eligible in this listing for these higher level computers
without an approved individual validated license or "other appropriate
export authority," remain in effect.

This notice should provide a good hint of what the final computer
decontrol will look like.

In another harbinger of how upcoming regulations may affect exporters,
BXA on December 7 notified DL holders that the regulatory reform
effort would include the new Special Comprehensive License, which will
expand the slate products and countries eligible for special license
exports.

Deborah Kappler, head of special licensing and compliance at BXA,
noted that when the new EAR is adopted, there will no longer be several
distinct special licenses, such as the DL, the service supply license, the
project license, and so on. Instead, these licenses will be consolidated into
one Special Comprehensive License (SCL).  DL  holders should refer to
part 752 of the EAR draft, which will be effective upon publication in the
Federal Register.  No changes in action or use of current special licenses
is required for 12 months.  But after that time, holders who wish to
continue will be switched to the SCL and will have to go for a new
pre-license consultation, reapply on new forms, and submit a copy of
their Internal Control Programs.

PARIAH RESTRAINT
Sanctions and Sanctimony on the Banking Committee
by E.J. Prior and Michael Schaffer

Score one for democracy.  With a vote balance resembling the majorities
commanded by Brezhnev in the Supreme Soviet, and a public hearing
which made the politburo look like a rancorous debating society, Senator
Alfonse D'Amato's Senate Banking Committee this month took a
courageous stand, they say, against dictatorship.  Making up in
self-congratulation and blatant bandwagon opportunism for what the new
bill, sponsored by D'Amato (R-NY) and ranking committee Democrat
Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), lacks in political daring, the Banking Committee,
with the passage of the Iran Foreign Oil Sanctions Act of 1995 (S. 1228),
has further tightened the thumbscrews on a reliably crowd-pleasing foe:
Iran.

The committee's December 12 hearing was not burdened with intricate
legislative maneuvering or political nuances.  Foregoing the
number-crunching details of a traditional public mark-up, D'Amato,
Sarbanes, and the paltry two other committee members who bothered to
attend instead rushed through fifteen minutes of pro forma gushing
before adjourning in time for the Senators to listen to Israeli Prime
Minister Peres' address to Congress.  The hearing proceeded as follows:
Committee chair D'Amato inveighed against Iranian terrorism and
praised Sarbanes' assistance in crafting and pushing this crucial piece of
legislation.  Sarbanes inveighed against Iranian terrorism and praised
D'Amato's leadership on the committee.  D'Amato, digressing briefly to
inveigh against Iranian terrorism, then praised Senator Barbara Boxer
(D-CA) for her crucial assistance with the bill.  Boxer, for her part,
inveighed against Iranian terrorism before launching into an adulatory
speech about D'Amato that may even have outdone her Democratic
colleague.

This celebration of committee backslapping and groupthink was a fitting
harbinger of the uncontested December 18 Senate vote that passed the
Iran Oil Sanctions Act. Still, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) added a
dose of drama the next day when he sponsored an amendment pulling
Libya, another oil-rich pariah, into the sanctions party.

All of this was timed perfectly to coincide with the seventh anniversary
of the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
and the same-day announcement that a Scottish businessman had been
indicted in Boston for selling over $250,000 worth of U.S. computer
equipment to Libya.  Rhetorical politics at its best: two terrorist birds
with one legislative stone.  Clearly, this is one bill whose target
constituency is unconcerned with the details, just so long as the bad guys
are getting it.

But what does all this mean for industry?  Lost in the posturing and
hoopla were the details of the bill, and what it suggests about future
government involvement in trade with politically profitable yet
economically marginal foreign targets. (Tremendously profitable China,
like Iran a dictatorship and an irresponsible world citizen, would never be
singled out for such treatment.)  Fortunately for exporters, the bill will
not require the imposition of U.S. trade sanctions against foreign
companies that do any trade-even in sweaters and garden hoses-with
Iran, as was previously contemplated. Removed from the bill were bans
on imports from any country that dealt in oil equipment with Iran, and a
ban on travel to the United States by executives of companies engaging in
such activity, two measures that would have signaled a drastic change in
American policy.  Also, the bill only penalizes those who invest more
than $40 million supporting oil refining procedures in either country over
any 12 month period.

So much for the good news.  The bill still requires the President to
impose one of four types of sanctions: Deny assistance from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank; Withhold export licenses of the foreign corporations
U.S. subsidiaries; prohibit commercial bank loans above $10 million;
and/or ban the operation of financial institutions that support oil
development projects in Iran or Libya.

The Iran Foreign Oil Sanctions Act of 1995 should alert industry that
they need to keep a watchful eye on Congress.  Though the stigma of
arguing against punishing pariah nations such as Iran and Libya could be
damaging from a public relations standpoint, industry should have
lobbied much harder against the measure, lest next time they are not so
lucky.

Senator D'Amato's stated goal-a laudable one-is to stop Iranian
terrorism. The problem is that this bill bears no relation to its fulfillment.
Instead, it will be greeted with rolled eyes by a domestic and foreign
public already cynical about U.S. policy's being subject to unpredictable
lurches to and fro at the whim of publicity-minded legislators, making
people still more unsure of what American policies really are, and less
likely to take us seriously when we do something we mean.  Usually The
Practitioner would skewer such a measure as an unreasonable
extraterritorial assertion of U.S. law that will end up hurting U.S.
industry.  But we won't waste our time on this one. That's because the
bill will be passed, signed by President Clinton and then tucked away in
the drawer of some mid-level NSC bureaucrat and forgotten for good.
The only folks that will hear about it again are the voters of New York
State, who will hear that their senator's impossible-to-implement
sanctions bill underscores his nails-man approach to Middle East
terrorism.

VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE
Third in a four-part series

The Export Practitioner has asked three leading practitioners to provide
their thoughts on four hypotheticals involving voluntary disclosure of
export violations.  Each of these individuals has asked to remain
anonymous so as not to affect cases they are handling for their respective
clients.  Their advice contains general legal guidance and should not be
construed as specific legal advice.

Subscribers are welcome to contact The Practitioner directly if they have
any specific questions regarding these essays.  The Practitioner again
thanks each of the three authors for the time and thought they have taken
in preparing these essays.

For eight years, Knowledge, Inc. a Huntsville, AL.-based computer firm
has been supplying general purpose computers to Enhanced Production
Concepts Inc. (EPCI), an Indian research firm.  When Knowledge filled
its first order to EPCI, it completed a comprehensive customer profile and
learned that EPCI was a reputable firm that assisted Indian companies
with enhancing their manufacturing operations.

Accordingly, Knowledge has made over 40 computer shipments to EPCI
since 1988 and has enjoyed a warm relationship with EPCI's principals.
Staff at the two companies routinely trade E-mail messages on topics
ranging from curry chicken and seafood gumbo to Himalayan treks and
how to buy gifts for people who have everything.  The E-mail traffic
omitted mention of export controls, for Knowledge's computer shipments
always fell under the Commerce Department's export licensing
thresholds.

However, a recent E-mail from EPCI set off the export compliance sirens
at Knowledge:  An EPCI engineer revealed that for the past three years
the company had been working on a project with the Indian government
to enhance the production of its line of Prithyi ballistic missiles.

Knowledge's export compliance officer, John Noblinders, plunged
immediately into a tizzy of panic.  He recalled the time at a 1992 BXA
seminar when Bill Clements scared him and his peers with his discussion
of Commerce's "know" controls, which require licenses for any shipment
that the exporter "knows" is destined for illicit weapons activities.
Noblinders comforted himself with the notion that he did not know about
the EPCI contract.  Then he E-mailed the entire sales staff and told them
to put on hold any new contracts with EPCI.  He got a response from the
South Asian sales manager saying that EPCI had briefed him on their
missile contract two years ago.  The manager added that some of the
recently shipped computers may have assisted with this project.

Is there a violation that merits voluntary disclosure by Knowledge, Inc.?

Essay number one

Knowledge, Inc. definitely has a problem that demands self-disclosure,
but the situation may not be as bad as its export compliance manager,
John Noblinders, believes. Clearly, Knowledge, Inc. has been violating
the Export Control Regulations by doing business with the Indian
company, Enhanced Production Concepts, Inc. (EPCI) for the past two
years, ever since Knowledge's South Asian sales manager was briefed on
the nature of EPCI's business.  Obviously, the incriminating information
passed on to the sales manager, who was an officer of Knowledge, Inc. at
the time, is the equivalent of "knowing" that EPCI was a company to
which any computers shipped would require a license, since any
knowledge gained by any officer can be imputed to the corporate entity.

Nonetheless, while low performance computers may have helped EPCI in
its design work on Prithyi ballistic missiles, it can be argued that they
were not at all integral to that work, and they did not advance the design
or production of such missiles in any unique way.  Therefore, the
self-disclosure-which should be made promptly and in full detail-could
argue that while there was a technical violation of the Export

Administration Regulations (EAR), the violation was incidental and
inconsequential.

Recent changes in the EAR/EPCI regulations recognize that not all
shipments to prohibited sites and prohibited activities are equal, that the
shipment has to in some way advance the design or production of the
proliferation-related product.  Particularly, in today's world, where
computers have been all but decontrolled (with only very high
performance supercomputers having any restrictions at all), it could
easily be argued that the computers that were shipped to EPCI over the
past two years were no more significant to the production of ballistic
missiles than other word processing and calculating devices, such as
pencils and slide rules.  While that argument may seem bizarre to those of
us who practiced export controls during the Cold War, it would be
difficult for a Government that has just decontrolled almost all computers
to almost all destinations around the world to argue that somehow these
particular low performance computers shipped by Knowledge, Inc. pose a
danger of undermining the antiproliferation objectives of the United
States Government.  This is not to claim that Knowledge, Inc. did not
violate the EAR, only that the penalty should fit the crime (which in
today's world is insignificant).

Essay number two

Knowledge, Inc. may have violated the EAR and, if so, is required to
disclose such violations to the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)
and the Census Bureau.  Under the Enhanced Proliferation Control
Initiative, an exporter must obtain a validated license for products
otherwise eligible for general license treatment only if BXA informs the
exporter that a validated license is required because there is an
unacceptable risk of use or diversion to missile projects (15 C.F.R. sec.
778.7(C)(2)); or if the exporter "knows" that the products are destined for
a missile project listed in Supplement 6 to Part 778 (15 C.F.R. sec.
778.7(C)(1)(i)); or if the exporter "knows" that the products will be
"directly employed" in the design, development, production, stockpiling,
or use of missiles (15 C.F.R. sec. 778.7(C)91)(ii); 58 Fed. Reg. 68029,
68030 (1993)).

BXA never informed Knowledge that a validated license was required for
exports to EPCI.  The Prithyi project is listed in Supplement 6 to Part 778
but, assuming that EPCI employed the computers at EPCI's facility and
not at the Prithyi facility, the products were not "destined for" a listed
project.  Nevertheless, Knowledge may be deemed to have had the
requisite "knowledge" that EPCI's computers would be directly
employed in missile design, development, or production.  The theory of
such violation would be that Knowledge's failure to inquire after seeing a
"red flag" constituted impermissible self-blinding.  If the goods in fact
were to be directly employed in missile design, development, or
production, Knowledge would be deemed to have had knowledge and
hence to have violated the EAR by exporting the products to EPCI under
a general license.

For the past two years, Knowledge's South Asian sales manager has
known that EPCI was assisting the Prithyi missile project.  Even
assuming that the sales manager did not have actual knowledge that EPCI
was "directly employing" Knowledge's products in the project, he had
sufficient information to raise a "red flag" concerning EPCI's activities.
Because the sales manager's knowledge almost certainly would be
imputed to Knowledge, this gave rise to a duty on the part of Knowledge
to inquire further.  If EPCI in fact was using the products to enhance the
production of missiles, a violation of the EAR occurred when Knowledge
shipped computers to EPCI after the sales manager learned about EPCI's
activity on the missile project.

Knowledge has stopped exports to EPCI and hence has no prospective
duty to inquire under the "know" provision of the nonproliferation
regulations.  But Knowledge probably has a duty to inquire under another
provision of the EAR.  Section 778.5(a)(3) requires exporters to notify
BXA and other cognizant agencies upon receipt of "information which
would lead a reasonable prudent person to believe that a change of
material fact or intention [previously represented to a federal agency] has
occurred."  This requirement is separate from and additional to the
nonproliferation validated license requirements of Parts 771 and 778.

When Knowledge exported its products to EPCI, Knowledge presumably
submitted Shipper's Export Declarations (SED) to the Census Bureau
(through the Customs Service) stating that the products were eligible for
export under general license.  Although Section 787.5(a)(3), like the
nonproliferation rules, is triggered by knowledge (i.e. "has occurred")
rather than such lesser thresholds as reason to know or reason to believe,
the presence of the "red flag" could constitute "knowledge" for purposes
of this provision in the same manner as for the nonproliferation
provisions.  That is, the "red flag" information gained by the sales
manager would mean that Knowledge must inquire whether the goods
required a validated license (and thus made "general license"
representation on the SEDs inaccurate).

If the inquiry yields positive information about such use, there is a
change in previously represented material fact or intention and Section
787.5(a)(3) requires Knowledge to file an amended SED with the Census
Bureau and to also advise BXA as well.

Essay number three

The EPCI "catch-all rules" present perhaps the stickiest of all voluntary
disclosure questions.  At this point, it is not yet clear whether Knowledge,
Inc. has committed a violation, but the facts indicate a strong possibility.
The question is whether the provisions of EAR 778.7(c) (1) were
violated; did someone in Knowledge, Inc. know that they were exporting
products that would be used in a listed missile project in India or that
would be used in design, development, production, or use of missiles in
or by India.  BXA published very helpful guidance on the catch-all rule
on December 23, 1993, clarifying that one must "know" that such
activities are transpiring for such a violation to occur.  (58 Fed. Reg.
64550; knew about EPCI's missile contract, and said that some of the
recently shipped computers "may" have assisted with the project.  A
more thorough investigation is required to determine whether they were
directly employed in such missile activities and whether anyone from
Knowledge knew this.  Careful interpretation of this murky law applied
to the facts learned is in order.

Knowledge, Inc. needs to take the following basic steps:

*  place further shipments to EPCI on hold pending results of the
investigation
*  alert the general counsel, CFO, or other appropriate person pursuant to
the company's compliance program so that a decision can be made at
appropriate levels of "shared responsibility" on this delicate matter;
*conduct a more thorough investigation (under the auspices of counsel to
retain the privilege) to determine whether there have in fact been any
violations;
* set up some type of screening program so these questions can be
ferreted out in advance, not two years after they should have arisen;
* train sales and other appropriate personnel on the EPCI catch-all rules,
instructing them to refer any questions to Noblinders, as export
compliance administrators are otherwise unlikely to know about such
information to supply their screening checklists effectively.

Whether or not there was a clear violation, Knowledge, Inc., should
seriously consider whether making some sort of voluntary disclosure is
nevertheless in its best interests.  The adverse publicity from dealing with
a missile manufacture can cause much worse collateral damage to a
company's reputation and thereby its sales and even its stock
performance than the potential export control law penalties.  If the
investigation shows clearly that employed in applicable missile activities,
so there was no violation of law, a report to BXA can help demonstrate
this fact and also show concern of the "good citizen" corporation in
bringing the matter to the attention of appropriate government officials
become a cause celeb, such a disclosure and consultation could provide
useful cover for the company and put it in a better posture than having no
action.

Unfortunately, a disclosure of no violation can also have the practical
effect of putting all future sales to EPCI on hold until BXA responds with
the requested advice, which could take a very long time (years in a few
cases).  The various agencies addressing EPCI problems have not
developed a sound process for answering these hard questions in the four
and a half years that the catch-all rule has been in place if there is a
problem, but the application is unclear, or they do not want to disclose
sources and methods of intelligence gathering.  Thus, if one wants to do
business with entities like EPCI, it is often better to make your own
decisions and thoroughly document your files than to file an end-user
check with BXA and see whether they are allowed by other agencies to
provide a meaningful response.

Clearly, this is a sticky wicket.  All advice in prior hypotheticals applies.
Further advice should await discovery of all the facts, and application of
the judgments of experienced counsel based on the benefits and
detriments of disclosure versus nondisclosure as applied to that company.

FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT

BXA Enforcement Heads Declare Victory on Efforts in 1995

In 1995, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) set a new high
water mark for enforcement of export control regulations, according to
John Despres, BXA's chief enforcement official. Despres commended
enforcement field agents and his higher-ups in the Clinton administration
for a record year both in terms of fine totals and related convictions for
export control violations.

But what does a successful 1995 mean for '96?  For starters, BXA plans
to hire new investigators in its various field offices.  Also, enforcement
officials plan to target foreign representatives of U.S. companies with a
hard-hitting message: Just as in 1995, export control violations in 1996
will bring dire consequences for their perpetrators.

Computers and Software Remain Targets for '96

Continuing a sift begun immediately after the conclusion of the Cold
War, BXA's enforcement efforts in 1996 will focus on nonproliferation
controls.  Despite the administration's imminent liberalization of controls
on computer hardware and technology, the Office of Export Enforcement
(OEE) will ply the country's ports for diversion of computer technology
to pariah nations such as Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, all of which
remain subject to U.S. embargoes.  This claim has credibility in light of
the recent arrest and indictment of a Scottish businessman for attempting
to send computers to Libya (See related story below).

So how can enforcement agents tell the difference between a 486
computer and one that operates in thousands or tens of thousands of
MTOPS?  Simple: They compare information from computer
manufacturers with information from shippers and other sources.

Of course, no way is as good as two of the most historically tried and true
methods:  Following the money, and the anonymous tip. The first of these
has been particularly helpful, says Despres, in cases involving high-grade
encryption software.  Any party interested in purchasing such software
generally seeks a continuing relationship with its supplier. The mere fact
that encryption software may be available on the Internet as freeware is
almost meaningless.  If a company wants reliable encryption software it
will buy it from a company, not download it off CompuServe.

Voluntary Disclosure a Mitigating Circumstance

Though it may never appear in writing, OEE wants exporters to know
that it welcomes voluntary disclosures and will consider them a
mitigating factor in enforcement cases.  "There is a strong and recurrent
interest on the part of exporters to know what the advantages are for
disclosing infractions," says John Despres. "We encourage this."  In
recent years, exporters have pressed OEE for written guidance on how
voluntary disclosures will be considered. Barring a reversal of existing
policy, OEE will not issue such guidance, but Despres said that the
awards of voluntary disclosure "will be very substantial."

Frustrated by industry pleas for concrete data on mitigation levels, Frank
Deliberti, BXA's deputy assistant secretary for enforcement, pointed to
the commendable record of voluntary disclosure mitigation. "There is a
real piece of information that could put this to bed," said Deliberti. "Over
99.8% of the cases end up in a warning letter, an information letter, or a
do-nothing letter."

AES Predeparture Certification Requirement Key to Enforcement Efforts

The big hang-up for Customs' Automated Export System (AES) is the
debate over its predeparture approval procedure.  Exporters are
convinced it will hang up their shipments.  Customs, for its part, says
they have nothing to worry about.  For BXA's enforcement folks,
moreover, AES-and especially predeparture certification-is a valuable
enforcement tool.  And Deliberti notes that the threat of having shipments
held up "is nothing new, and it could still be held up based on current
regulations."

In whatever way AES is implemented, it will provide critical information,
potential leads, and answer questions for investigations in a more timely
manner.  As opposed to the current system, under which agents sift
through piles of paper SEDs, they will now have at their disposal a much
more comprehensive and timely set of information to be used in
investigations and enforcement actions.  Industry doesn't want to hear
this, and will let the government hear it vociferously once the first
shipment is unnecessarily delayed and an exporter loses business as a
result.

Scottish Businessman Stung Trying to Ship Computer to Libya

David McKeeve had no idea what he was in for when he traveled from
Scotland to Boston to clear up some paperwork problems with the Boston
seaport supervisor. McKeeve explained to the official that an October
1995 shipment of computers were destined for Cyprus or Ethiopia. After
McKeeve signed documents swearing to this, the seaport supervisor
revealed his true identity-a Customs enforcement official-and arrested
McKeeve for conspiring to export computers to Libya in contravention of
the U.S. embargo.

The indictment, unsealed on December 19, charges that McKeeve, along
with associates of his company, McNeil International, attempted to export
$335,000 worth of computers from Boston to Libya in October by
falsifying the ultimate destination of the shipments.

U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern, who is prosecuting McKeeve, praised the
Customs Service for its action: "The Customs Service did an excellent
job in getting him back into this country, so that he cold be arrested and
face an American court." If convicted, McKeeve faces a maximum
penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of $550,000.  The computer
equipment is also subject to forfeiture.

Filtration and Pumping Equipment Manufacturer Hit with Antiboycott
Violation Penalties

An administrative law judge this month affirmed Commerce Department
charges against Illinois-based Serflico, Ltd., a commercial filtration and
pumping equipment manufacturer and its President, Jack H. Berg, for 25
violations of the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration
Regulations.  Serflico was penalized $118,000, while Berg was set back
$90,000 in civil penalties.  The judge also barred Serflico for one year
from exporting to Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of
Yemen.  Mr. Berg could not be reached for comment.

The judge found that between January and July of 1989, Serflico and
Berg had violated the antiboycott prohibition by furnishing business
relationship information in responding to a boycott questionnaire from a
distributor in Iraq.  Serflico also failed to report to Commerce its receipt,
on seven different occasions, of boycott-related requests.  The antiboycott
regulations require companies to report all such requests to the
Department of Commerce or be subject to civil penalties and denial of
export privileges.  The antiboycott provisions also prohibit providing
information on a company's business relationship with a boycotted
company, or with any person known or believed to be restricted form
conducting business with a country that participates in the Arab boycott
of Israel.

LOGISTICS LOG

Harbor Maintenance Fee Collection Prohibited-But Court Stays its
Decision

The New York-based Court of International Trade will allow the Clinton
administration to continue collecting the Harbor Maintenance Fee
(HMF), a levy that it struck down in October as an unconstitutional tax
on exports, until the administration's appeal is heard.

The appeal may take years, and in the meantime exporters should follow
one of two courses to have their HMF payments refunded. First, continue
to file quarterly HMF statements and pay the appropriate fees.  Then file
for a refund in accordance with Customs' refund filing procedures.
When Customs denies this request, file a formal protest with Customs.
Once the formal request is denied, file directly with the Court of
International Trade.  Under the alternative approach, file directly with the
Court of International Trade.

In addition, the judge handling the case will entertain briefs on whether
interest should be refundable along with the fees, and, if so, when the
interest should begin accruing.  According to Munford Page Hall II, a
partner at Dorsey and Whitney in Washington, D.C., who represents an
interested party in the case, the judge will have to decide whether interest
will start accruing for the prejudgement period, the postjudgement period,
both, or neither.

AES Team Remains Unfazed by the Court's Decision

For Customs' Automated Export System (AES) Team, it is business as
usual.  Though HMF collection was once trumpeted as one of AES'
greatest benefits, Customs is moving ahead regardless of the court's
decision.  This decision is as much budgetary realpolitik as a defense of
the HMF.  AES officials are convinced that even if the court's decision is
upheld on appeal, Congress, obsessed more than ever with tax revenue,
will not tolerate the loss of HMF revenue.

To make up the difference, AES officials think that lawmakers will draft
an HMF that will withstand constitutional scrutiny.  The long-term view
is to build a system to collect fees because Customs is sure that there will
eventually be a "legislative fix," says Peter Baish, Customs' Outbound
Process Director.

Editor's Note:  Almost immediately upon announcement of the trade
court's decision, opponents of HMF universally changed its language and
began calling it HMT.  The "T" standing for tax rather than "F" for fee.
In accordance with the industry standard, and to emphasize the
Practitioner's support of the court's ruling, the Practitioner will from this
point forward use the convention HMT when discussing the issue.

AES Hints at Plan for Early '96

Customs will be conducting random checks on business travelers to
verify compliance with export controls on hand-carried items such as
laptop computers and cellular phones. The compliance checks will focus
on flights to countries where demand for high-tech products is great and
that are subject to tight U.S. export restrictions.  Customs will be
examining whether such checks are worth the effort-a determination
that will take one year to make.

Through AES, Customs will also reportedly attempt to "help" smaller and
uninformed companies prevent unintentional violations.  It remains to be
seen whether this is a public relations effort or whether Customs is being
a truly charitable government agency.  In another effort, Customs hopes
to use AES to identify odd transactions.  One place that AES will help,
explains Baish, is when there is a suspect export of, for example, farm
equipment from the Bronx to Columbia.  Having such information
available electronically rather than on a paper SED will enhance
enforcement efforts.

Discussing another long-range '96 plan, Dorleen Pilachowski of the AES
Team confirmed that Customs will attempt to include all export forms
into the AES system, such as export licenses.   The idea is to present "one
government face" to the export community, says Pilachowski.  They will
reportedly do this, however, only after a lot of inter-agency consultation.

Customs had better start consulting soon: Bill Reinsch, The Bureau of
Export Administration's chief export official, is already on record in last
month's Practitioner as saying that even though he supports the general
notion of AES, he would be against it if Customs attempts to include
license applications in the system.  "We think that a system to file export
licenses would be a bad idea," said Reinsch.

INSIDE BXA

What Shutdown?

Yes, the government is shut down and its employees furloughed until
further notice.  But as the public goes without its national parks and the
Vermeer exhibit, BXA, like the pink Energizer Bunny, just keeps going
and going and going with what is little more than a skeleton crew.  Credit
for BXA's continued operation lies squarely with its Under Secretary,
William Reinsch, who has been charged with the multiple-hat duties of
emergency export license administrator, enforcement agent, public
relations officer, etc.  If you place a call to BXA while the shutdown is
still in effect, don't be surprised if the BXA chief answers the phone too.

Nevertheless, according to Reinsch, the shutdown has had a severe
impact on export licensing.  BXA typically approves an average of 35
licenses a day at a value of  $32.5 million.  Each day they also receive
over 400 calls for information.  During the shutdown, none of that is
happening.  Additionally, 1,027 pending license applications worth $2.3
billion are in administrative limbo because they are not being acted on.
"I object in principle to holding hostages," said Reinsch in an interview,
"The President is prepared to negotiate to achieve the result everybody
wants.  [Congress'] actions are incomprehensible."

Other than licensing issues, BXA has held onto its computer personnel,
two assistant secretaries, and its enforcement agents.  BXA's enforcement
agents are deemed essential, just as any other federal law enforcement
personnel.  So your chances of sneaking unlicensed goods out of the
country are the same as they are in normal times.

The biggest change in BXA's game plan for the shutdown this month-as
compared to handling last month's shutdown-was its retention of the
11-member export regulation rewrite squad.  As the deadline for the new
Export Administration Regulations (EAR) neared, BXA went to its
official-in-the-clutch to get the job done in time for January's big
event-the exporter's Super Bowl-Update West.  With the clock running
out, BXA sent EAR veteran Larry Christensen, sidelined during last
month's shutdown, dashing onto the regulatory playing field to lead the
rewrite team to San Jose with something to show: a new EAR.

Christensen was not quite able to get the new regulations out by BXA's
initial goal of January 1, and had to bring the agency's efforts into
overtime so that participants at Update West would have a new EAR to
take home with them.  The unofficial revised goal of getting the new regs
to the Federal Register is now set for January 12.  It is not yet known
whether the EAR will be in hard copy format or on diskette.

In addition to its presentation at Update West, BXA is preparing outreach
presentations around the country to explain the new regs to exporters
(See schedule at bottom of this column).  The presentations will include
written training materials, charts, visual materials and the like.  It is yet 
to be determined if these materials will be mailed out to interested persons
or whether the parties will have to attend the presentations

In any event, the rewrite has undergone no further adjustments of great
magnitude since the  November draft version.  "There are no deal killers.
Nothing will torpedo it," said one BXA source.  According to Eric
Hirschhorn, a partner at Winston and Strawn law firm in Washington,
D.C., the new regulations will make life easier for the first-time exporter,
but they will disorient veteran exporters steeped in the arcane ways of the
long-standing regulations. Further, foreign reexporters face an even more
difficult task with the new regulations, which will not even include a
chapter to reexports, as the current regulations do.

Control List Makes Switch to EU Numbering System

The Euro trend has reached the untrendy world of export controls. As
part of an interim rule to overhaul dual-use export control regulations, the
Bureau of  Export Administration (BXA) will convert all Export Control
Commodity Numbers (ECCN) in the Commerce Control List (CCL) to
the format used by the twelve countries of the European Union.

To assist exporters in bridging the transition between the two formats,
BXA will place a "slashed-out" version of the current ECCN entries
alongside the new Euro versions. The most obvious difference between
the two versions is plain to see: The European ECCNs are one character
longer than the long-standing CCL versions. Still, the new ECCNs should
scarcely pose an intellectual challenge even for the most blockheaded
exporter. For example, the current ECCN 3A01A under the new format
will be 3A001.

In other changes to the CCL, BXA is adding entries to CCL category 10
(Miscellaneous) covering items on the International Atomic Energy List
(a.k.a. the "Trigger List"). Also, the "related controls" and "related
definitions" sections have been added to every entry. If neither applies to
a particular entry, the term "N/A" is used.

Executive Order Expedites
Licensing   Sort of

On December 5, President Clinton dusted off and then signed Executive
Order 12981, a year-old initiative that purports to streamline the
interagency processing of export license applications. "Early on, this
Administration committed itself to a broad interagency review process,
but one which provided accountability," said Bill Reinsch.  "This
Executive Order accomplishes both of those goals.  It is good for U.S.
business and the American people."

For exporters, the order promises a more responsive export control
regime, as it reduces to 90 days from 120 days the government's deadline
for reaching decisions on export license applications. If a decision is not
passed down within the deadline, the case is automatically referred to the
president for final resolution. The order's effective date is February 6,
1996.

The order allows all federal agencies access to export license applications
submitted to BXA on the condition that the agencies deliver their
recommendations within 30 days of receipt. Should they fail to issue a
recommendation, BXA may assume that they support the application.
BXA officials argue that the inclusion of all agencies in the licensing
process will protect national security, foreign policy and nonproliferation
interests.

In the event that an agency recommends denying  a license application, it
must clearly state the recommendation's statutory or regulatory basis.
The order also requires agencies to adhere to strict review deadlines.
Here's a quick look at the time frame under which agencies will have to
operate:

Within nine days of registration:
* additional information must be requested if needed
* the license must be referred interagency
* it must be Returned Without Action (RWA) in the event a license is not
needed
* an intent to deny must be issued
* classification of an item must be verified and the license must be
granted if there is no referral

Other agencies that request referrals will have only 10 days to request
additional information and 30 days to recommend approval or denial.  An
interagency review board will resolve disputes among the relevant
agencies. Under the order, a subcommittee of  the Advisory Committee
on Export Policy (ACEP), which consists of representatives of the
departments of State, Defense, Energy, and the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, must resolve disputes over applications within 14
days. The subcommittee's decisions may be appealed to the ACEP chair,
the Under-Secretary of Export Administration, who must make a final
decision within 5 days of the decision.

If an agency fails to give its recommendation in the allotted time frame,
the agency will be considered to have no objection to the issuance or
denial of a license.  In other words, acquiescence is acceptance.

The interagency review process will need some fine tuning, however.
According to Eric Hirschhorn, former head of what is now BXA, the
order still does not apply to the Central Intelligence Agency, which is the
biggest dilatory culprit when it comes to license applications. In addition,
licenses that under the old system would be reviewed in less than 10 days
may now take longer, as various agencies get in on the act of reviewing
the dwindling number of applications submitted to BXA.


New Computer Regulations Near Completion

The computer export decontrol announced by President Clinton in
October will appear as a final rule in the Federal Register by early
February, according to BXA officials (see related article page 8).
Implementation of the decontrol has reportedly been hung up over a
dispute with Japan over whether the decontrol violates the 1991
U.S-Japan agreement to jointly regulate exports of supercomputers.
President Clinton introduced the initiative as a unilateral measure after
Tokyo balked at approving the radical level of decontrol that it set forth.
According to administration sources, however, recent negotiations with
Tokyo have patched up the differences.

BXA to Play Role in CWC Implementation

With the Chemical Weapons Convention now moving through Senator
Helms' Foreign Relations Committee (see related article page 5), BXA
will now be responsible for developing and maintaining a database of
domestic chemical production, says Bill Reinsch.  In addition, BXA will
be preparing the treaty's regulations so that exporters will be able to
prepare for the treaty's requirements.  BXA will also be responsible for
organizing the logistics for approximately 15 to 20 regular inspections
(inspections with advance notice) per year.  They expect two or three
challenge inspections (inspections without notice) per year.  The
Bureau's officials will accompany inspectors and will organize outreach
efforts.

Commerce Includes Software and Semiconductors Under General
License GLX

The Commerce Department announced on December 13 that it has
expanded eligibility for General License GLX to include commodities
such as virus protection software and semiconductor items.  The
expansion also includes mobile telephones that contain encryption
technology, a change that eliminates cumbersome validated licensing
requirements for U.S. exporters. GLX authorizes license-free exports of a
wide range of dual-use commodities for civil end-users in China, the
former republics of the former Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe.

Industry applauded Commerce's announcement.  "This modernization of
export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needless and costly
licensing delays and burdensome paperwork," said Thomas W.
Armstrong, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).

Producers had long claimed that such items were widely available in the
international marketplace and that U.S. restrictions hampered their efforts
to compete globally.  Statistics show that less than one-third of some 139
billion semiconductors and 33 billion integrated circuits were made in the
United States.  Mobile telephone producers-such as Motorola and
Nokia-will benefit from the change.

"This expansion of the GLX category is a prime example of our efforts to
eliminate controls that are no longer necessary and to help U.S. business
compete globally," said BXA chief Bill Reinsch.  "This expansion will
lead to new export opportunities for U.S. businesses, and increased
opportunities for U.S. businesses and increased exports mean a stronger
U.S. economy and jobs for our citizens."

Hong Kong bank granted branch status 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Deborah Shen

     The Ministry of Finance on Oct. 15 approved a proposal by the
Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's largest bank, to upgrade its
representative office in Taiwan to branch status.
     The BEA is the first bank with mainland Chinese investment to be
permitted into the Taiwan market. Also, it is only the second Hong
Kong-based bank allowed to set up a branch on the island. The first
such branch was opened in 1984 by the Hongkong Bank, also known as
the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd.
     But as the Hongkong Bank relocated its headquarters to London
several years ago, the BEA can be seen as the only bank truly
headquartered in Hong Kong to operate a branch here on the island,
the ministry noted.
     The ministry expects that approval of the BEA's upgrade proposal
will encourage the Hong Kong government to gradually give the green
light to each of the seven similar proposals made by Taiwan-based
banks. The Taiwan banks have applied to either set up representative
offices in the British colony or upgrade their existing offices there
to branch status.
     The BEA had applied to the ministry more than a year ago to
upgrade its representative office, which was set up in Taiwan in
April 1993. But as the bank failed to meet the ministry's request for
concrete data on its mainland Chinese ties, the ministry postponed
approval of the application.
     The move in turn caused the Hong Kong government to also delay
approval of the applications by the seven Taiwan-based banks,
according to the ministry.
     The situation improved a few months ago when the BEA presented a
list of its shareholders to the ministry. After reviewing the
information, the ministry decided to approve the upgrade proposal, as
it was determined that the mainland Chinese stake accounts for only
11.77 percent of the bank's total capital. The figure is well below
the 20 percent ceiling imposed by the ROC government.
     However, because the BEA is a listed company, it is possible
that the percentage of mainland Chinese-owned shares could increase
over time. Thus, if the 20 percent ceiling should ever be exceeded,
the ministry said it will have to consult with the Mainland Affairs
Council at that time on how to handle the case.
     As of the end of 1995, the BEA had capital assets totaling
US$1.1 billion, ranking the bank as Hong Kong's largest. The bank has
74 branches in Hong Kong, in addition to six more branches and five
representative offices in mainland China.

Taiwan outward investment ranks as 2nd highest in Asia 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Kelly Her

     Taiwan's outbound investment last year ranked as the second
highest in Asia, according to a United Nations report cited locally
by the Council for Economic Planning and Development.
     Outward investment by Asian countries and territories in 1995
amounted to US$43 billion, representing 90 percent of such investment
by developing countries worldwide, the CEPD said, referring to the
report.
     Hong Kong was Asia's top supplier of foreign capital last year,
investing US$25 billion abroad, mainly in mainland China.
     Taiwan placed second with outbound investment totaling US$3.8
billion. Mainland China ranked third with US$3.5 billion, South Korea
fourth with US$3 billion and Malaysia fifth with US$2.6 billion.
     The same report noted that the mainland not only was the third
largest foreign investor in Asia, but was also the region's top
foreign investment site.
     But the pace of foreign capital coming into the mainland is
expected to slow after hitting a peak this year due to the mainland's
implementation of credit-tightening measures and gradual phasing out
of preferential treatments for foreign investors. Foreign investment
in the mainland is projected to fall below US$30 billion in 1997.
     However, the report said the mainland investment by Japan, South
Korea and the European Union will likely increase despite the general
slowdown.
     The report noted that as long as the mainland enjoys rapid
economic growth and opens new investment fields, it will remain a
major foreign investment site.
     According to the report, worldwide investment in developing
countries last year accumulated to US$99.7 billion on impressive 15
percent annual growth. Two-thirds of this investment capital headed
to Asia, with the mainland absorbing the most, or 38 percent.
     Investment capital injected into Asian countries from throughout
the world reached US$65 billion in 1995, representing an increase of
21 percent from a year before. Ninety percent of the investment funds
were destined for Southeast Asia and East Asia.
     Foreign investment during the year in the mainland, Malaysia and
Singapore reached US$37.5 billion, US$5.8 billion and US$5.3 billion,
respectively. Projects in Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong totaled
US$4.5 billion, US$2.3 billion and US$2.1 billion, respectively.

High-speed railway bidding to open 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Kelly Her

     The Ministry of Transportation and Communications is scheduled
to make a public announcement at the end of October inviting private
firms to participate in Taiwan's high-speed railway project.
     Different from in the past, the ministry will divide the bidding
into two phases by first selecting qualified applicants and then
conducting thorough evaluations of their detailed investment plans.
     Qualified applicants must possess considerable financial assets
and technological capabilities. On the financial side, a bidder needs
to have either a minimum paid-in capital of US$363 million or annual
revenues of more than US$1.09 billion. Sound financial performance
over the past three years is also required of an applicant.
     The ministry's guidelines permit several companies to pool their
efforts and bid collectively in the form of an alliance. An alliance
bid must have a combined paid-in capital of at least US$363 million.
Each investor in the partnership is required to have paid-in capital
totaling US$72 million or more.
     The 330-kilometer rail will provide an express link between
Taipei, the northern business center of the island, and Kaohsiung, a
major port city in the south. The high-speed transportation system is
slated to become operational by the year 2003.
     As designed, the large-scale railway project will cost around
US$16 billion. Also, it has been decided that private capital must
account for more than 40 percent, or US$6.42 billion, of the
project's total investment.
     Participation is open to private firms on a
build-operate-transfer basis. The categories available for private
investment include rail installation, station construction,
electrical engineering and maintenance operations.
     As such, the project is expected to add vigor to Taiwan's
construction, electrical engineering and financial service sectors by
bringing ample business opportunities to them.
     But opportunities exist in more than only the construction
phase. Private firms will also have the opportunity to take charge of
the management, operation and maintenance of the transportation
system after its completion, according to the ministry's Provisional
Engineering Office of the High-Speed Rail.
     This aspect explains why such strict financial conditions have
been imposed on bidders, the office noted.
     In the days ahead, the office plans to organize several
investment seminars targeting leading domestic and foreign
conglomerates in an effort to spur their eagerness to participate in
the high-speed railway project.

Visa's card for stored value introduces electronic cash 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Deborah Shen

     Visa International Service Association will cooperate with eight
banks in Taiwan to issue "Visa Cash" cards on the island at the
beginning of next year.
     The move will mark the first entry of an international-standard,
microchip-based, stored-value purchasing card into the Taiwan market.
In addition, it also ushers in a new era of purchasing with
electronic cash in Taiwan, according to Visa, which already issues
the No. 1 credit card on the island.
     The U.S.-based company and the eight local banks held a joint
news conference in Taipei on Oct. 15 to announce the launching in
Taiwan of a Visa Cash pilot program. The partnership expects that
200,000 disposable Visa Cash cards will be available on the market in
early 1997.
     So-called Visa Cash is an alternative purchasing medium for
everyday low-value products and services like newspapers, bus fares
and cups of coffee. The microchip embedded in the stored-value card
automatically deducts the amount of each purchase to keep track of
the card's remaining value.
     "Visa Cash will revolutionize the way Taiwan people pay for
small-value purchases," according to Raymond Chan, executive vice
president and general manager of Visa's North Asia, Asia-Pacific
region.
     As cardholders do not need to authorize transactions by using
personal identification numbers or signing their signatures, Visa
Cash is nearly as convenient to use as regular currency, Chan noted.
     Since Visa launched a pilot program in Hong Kong in August of
this year, more than 100,000 Visa Cash cards have been issued in the
British colony, according to the company executive.
     Chan said Taiwan is an ideal market for the service, as the
average local consumer spends about US$7,275 annually on daily
necessities.
     The eight local banks participating in the program include
Citibank, Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank,
International Commercial Bank of China, Chung Shing Bank, Far Eastern
International Bank, Grand Commercial Bank and Taishin International
Bank.
     In the first phase of the Taiwan pilot, the eight banks will
issue 200,000 disposable Visa Cash cards in denominations of NT$1,000
(about US$36) and NT$500, according to Albert Shiung, vice president
of Visa International Asia-Pacific and the company's country manager
in Taiwan.
     Shiung further explained that the success of the initial phase
will lead to the issuance of value-reloadable purchasing cards.
     The firm said 5,000 Visa Cash purchase-processing devices will
be installed at convenience stores, food courts in department stores,
fast-food restaurants and supermarkets across Taiwan.

A booster shot for democracy 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p6

by FCJ Editors

     The National Development Conference scheduled for December holds
out promise for the continued advance of democracy in the Republic of
China on Taiwan. But much work must be done beforehand to ensure that
the forum concentrates on the promotion of genuine political
communication. Five days, while a fair amount of time for
brainstorming ideas, can rush by in a blur when it comes to searching
for agreement on bedrock issues.
     Fortunately, work began weeks ago. A Presidential Office task
force established a broad-based preparatory committee to organize the
conference, and seminars throughout the Taiwan area have been planned
to sound out grassroots opinion before the forum actually convenes
Dec. 23 in Taipei. The preparatory committee's initial work has been
hopeful. On Oct. 11, committee members from all three major parties
agreed on an ambitious aim for the conference: to build a consensus
on the major topics of future national development in order to
formulate policies and put them into practice.
     The three main topics--constitutional reform and party politics,
economic development, and relations between Taiwan and mainland
China--have fundamental importance. ROC parliamentary bodies, though
crucibles of democratic debate, sometimes cannot escape gridlock. The
economy has been sluggish. And intermediary agency talks between
Taiwan and mainland China have been on hold for 16 months. Sharply
contested political issues cluster in thickets around all of these
topics. The 150 conference delegates, meeting outside established
government structures, will attempt to break pathways into the clear.
     President Lee Teng-hui introduced the idea of the National
Development Conference in his inaugural address May 20, and the
meeting of course has a historic precedent. In the summer of 1990,
after his first-term inauguration, Lee convoked the similarly named
National Affairs Conference. It gave birth to several agreements that
built the framework for Taiwan's democratization, such as the direct
election of the provincial governor and Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors.
     In addressing the preparatory committee last week, Lee set the
tone for the forthcoming conference. He pointed out that national
development reached a new stage with the direct presidential election
this year and asserted that "how to concentrate the experience and
wisdom of our people" is the key to the future.
     The ROC's political landscape has indeed changed in six years.
New democratic institutions are in place. The rule of law has been
strengthened. The government is more representative and more
responsive. Yet progress, while it leaves old roads behind, also
presents new and uncharted regions ahead. The National Development
Conference can at the very least help light the way.

Religious group scandal leads to cult crackdown 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p4

by Christie Su

     ROC law enforcement agencies have launched an island-wide
crackdown on religious cults whose illegal activities threaten social
stability and undermine public morality in Taiwan.
     The operation targets religious cults and temples across Taiwan
which are not registered with the government, swindle money out of
followers through fraudulent means, or have ties to gangster
organizations.
     Moreover, the Interior Ministry has announced its intention to
establish an interministerial task force that will focus on
strengthening the management of affairs related to civilian groups on
the island.
     The various measures are part of the government's wide-ranging
war on crime. The cleanup campaign comes in the wake of a major
religious scandal involving "supernatural" shenanigans, political
figures, gangsters, enormous sums of money, and thousands of duped
people in Taiwan and in mainland China.
     The scandal surfaced last week when Taipei City Councilor Chu
Mei-feng accused a Taipei-based cult, the Sung Chi-li Miracle
Association, of swindling money from people.
     Chu, a member of the New Party, announced in an Oct. 9 press
conference that she had received complaints from around 40 people who
claimed cult leader Sung Chi-li had cheated money from them through
fraudulent acts.
     Meanwhile, several association members went to the police with
similar charges against Sung.
     Councilwoman Chu also named Frank Hsieh, the Democratic
Progressive Party's vice presidential candidate in the elections this
past March, as being associated with the cult. Moreover, Hsieh, a
former legislator, was accused of having received about US$580,000 in
campaign donations from cult leader Sung.
     Hsieh, however, denied receiving any such donations and
clarified that his only tie to the association is that he has served
as its legal consultant.
     It was also reported that some government officials in Taiwan,
including the deputy director-general of the National Police
Administration, Yu Yu-tang, might be associated with the mystic cult.
     On Oct. 10, the Miracle Association issued a statement refuting
all charges against it. The statement emphasized that the association
was a registered private organization devoted to helping people by
teaching them how to discover their real selves through philosophical
learning. The group further stressed that it had no links to illegal
businesses.
     But an extensive police investigation and an explosion of media
coverage on the case suggested otherwise, resulting in the arrest of
Sung and several core members of the association on fraud charges.
     The police investigation revealed that the cult leader, whose
real name is Sung Chien-lin, had a string of previous convictions on
fraud and violations of the so-called negotiable instruments law.
     Using trick photography, Sung had convinced his association
members that he possessed the ability to separate his body and soul
and miraculously manifest himself at different points on the globe
simultaneously. This purported supernatural power of his can be used
to help his followers ascend to paradise after death, he had claimed.
     But during police interrogations a few days after the scandal
broke, Sung finally admitted that the manifestation photos were fakes
and he did not possess any supernatural powers.
     Police reports said Sung had bilked association members out of
about US$7 million. The illegal fortune was amassed through several
sources: the sale of books, video tapes and photographs about Sung's
so-called miraculous manifestations, donations from the cult leader's
followers, and fees Sung charged to people who wanted to meet him in
person to learn how to develop supernatural powers for themselves.
     Reportedly, one photograph showing a haloed image of Sung
floating in the sky above a range of mountains was purchased by a
cult follower for US$3,000. Personal meetings with Sung, however,
came with a price tag of US$363,000 each, according to media reports.
     The ill-gotten gains afforded Sung a luxurious lifestyle. He
reportedly had vast real estate holdings, including the elaborately
decorated association temple. The gaudy-looking temple has since been
razed by the Taipei City Government for building code violations.
     Taipei police authorities also have alleged that Sung and his
association maintained links to underworld organizations.
     Police reports said Sung's group set up money-soliciting
branches in mainland China as well as Taiwan. Members of the mainland
branches included college professors and ranking Chinese Communist
officials.
     The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office said it has frozen the
assets of the association pending completion of the investigation.
     Hsieh, the former lawmaker accused of receiving political
donations from the association, on Oct. 14 filed slander charges
against Councilwoman Chu.
     News analysts suggested that the allegations of Hsieh's close
relations with the cult will probably become a hindrance in his
political future. Hsieh had recently announced that he wanted to run
for the mayor's office in Kaohsiung in two years.
     The campaign to ensure propriety in religious activities also
includes inviting religious leaders in Taiwan to discuss how to break
down potentially harmful superstitions in society, said Chao Shou-po,
secretary-general of the Executive Yuan.

Open telecom door prompts a surge 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by Kelly Her

     The opening of Taiwan's telecommunications market has encouraged
leading foreign investors to launch new projects on the island,
resulting in a dramatic rise in the overall inward investment during
September.
     Approved investments in Taiwan by foreign nationals and overseas
Chinese in September totaled US$345 million, a sharp rise of 78
percent over the previous month.
     In its report, the Investment Commission of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs attributed the surge in inward investment to the
liberalization of Taiwan's telecommunications market.
     Representing the biggest of September's foreign-funded
telecommunications projects, the Taiwan affiliate of U.S.-based
Southwest Bell Corp. funneled US$123 million into a joint venture on
the island.
     As for in the first nine months of the year, the Investment
Commission approved 344 foreign investment projects on the island, up
15 percent from the same period of the previous year. These projects
were valued at US$1.64 billion, down 5 percent from the year-earlier
level.
     Despite a downturn in sales in the semiconductor sector, the
electronics and electrical products industry still attracted the most
foreign investment of all industries in Taiwan in the
January-September period. Even so, the industry's investment total
was a substantial 50 percent lower than the year-earlier total, the
commission reported.
     The period's other leading investment areas included the
island's banking and insurance, wholesale and retail, food and
beverage, and service industries. Together with the electronics and
electrical products industry, these industries accounted for 55
percent of the total inward investment between January and September.
     The commission said the government's campaign to build Taiwan
into an Asian Pacific operations hub is helping to attract foreign
investment into the five industries.
     Looking at September's outbound investment in areas besides
mainland China, the commission's report said Taiwan enterprises
poured US$156 million into 32 projects overseas. The value figure
represented a hefty 62 percent increase over the non-mainland
outbound investment of the same month a year ago.
     In the first nine months of the year, non-mainland outward
investment by Taiwan firms climbed to US$1.49 billion, up an
impressive 49 percent from the year-earlier period.
     The most popular investment areas of the Taiwan firms were the
banking and insurance, electronics and electrical products, and
service industries. Projects in the three industries made up 62
percent of the island's total outbound investment between January and
September.
     A particularly strong increase was noted in Taiwan firms'
establishment of investment holding companies overseas in the period.
The commission said this was a reflection of the trend by the
island's investors to update their information and technologies as a
means of accelerating their internationalization and bolstering their
competitiveness.
     The report also evaluated investment targeted at the other side
of the Taiwan Straits. In September, the commission gave the green
light to only 16 mainland investment proposals filed by local firms,
a decrease of 48 percent from the number of proposals in August and a
record single-month low.
     The aggregate value of September's mainland projects was US$46.4
million, down 62 percent from August and the lowest value in 20
months.
     The slowdown indicates that the mainland investment fever of
Taiwan enterprises has subsided significantly in response to
President Lee Teng-hui's call for the government to review its policy
on cross-Straits business exchanges, according to the commission.
     In the first nine months of the year, the number of approved
mainland proposals decreased 24 percent from the year-earlier period.
However, the value figure increased 15 percent. The commission
attributed this phenomenon to the fact that the average size   of
Taiwan companies' mainland projects is getting bigger, even though
the number of projects is dwindling.
     In an attempt to lure more foreign capital to the island, the
Economics Ministry has targeted 10 newly developing industries in
Taiwan for active investment promotion. The 10 include the consumer
electronics, communications, precision machinery, semiconductors,
aerospace, pharmaceuticals, high-end materials, health care
equipment, pollution prevention equipment, and bio-technology
industries.
     Chou Yen, director-general of the ministry's Industrial
Development and Investment Center, said the IDIC will encourage
foreign firms to inject capital into these industries.
     To help formulate measures for promoting such investment, the
center will survey foreign firms already operating on the island to
see whether they plan to launch new or expansion projects, he added.
     Also, the center already has sent out correspondences to leading
firms around the world, introducing Taiwan's investment environment
to them and inviting them to gear up local projects, Chou said.
     Ministry statistics show that since 1952 a total of 7,705
foreign-invested projects, worth around US$36 billion, have been
approved by the government.

Production drain to mainland 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by FCJ Editors

     Thirty percent of the Taiwan investors with projects in mainland
China have completely ceased production here on the island, according
to a survey report released Oct. 14 by the ROC Mainland Affairs
Council.
     The council commissioned the Chinese Professional Management
Association of Taipei to conduct the survey on some 300 Taiwan
investors on the mainland.
     According to the survey, many of the investors who no longer
manufacture their products in Taiwan continue to receive export
orders and conduct research and development work here on the island.
     However, about 10 percent of Taiwan's mainland investors have
withdrawn their operations from the island entirely. Of these
companies, 40 percent are now engaged in agriculture, fishery or
mining on the mainland. Many others operate service businesses there.
     More than 60 percent of the investors surveyed are focusing on
the mainland's domestic market.
     Some 89 percent of those surveyed said they continue to purchase
the materials they need for mainland production from plants in
Taiwan. However, a declining trend is foreseen, as half of the
investors said they plan to reduce their Taiwan materials purchases
in the days ahead. Explaining the reason for the expected change,
they noted that more upstream and midstream Taiwan factories are
deciding to relocate to the mainland.
     About 30 percent of those surveyed said they think the products
they produce in Taiwan and on the mainland are of the same level of
quality. This is seen as a sign that the production technology on the
mainland has improved.

UPS opens regional center 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by FCJ Editors

     The U.S.-based courier United Parcel Service opened its
Asia-Pacific regional center at the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport on Oct. 10.
     UPS said the northern Taiwan center will bolster its service
to regional customers and eventually hook up with the company's
European base to form a worldwide delivery network. More than that,
the opening of the first phase of the UPS center is seen as a step
toward Taiwan becoming a regional air shipping hub.
     The inauguration of the US$400 million center, however, was
marred by a demonstration by 100 members of the Taipei Air Cargo and
Warehousing Industrial Union, who said the inroad gained by UPS will
enable the U.S. firm to seriously undermine their businesses.
     The union companies said the privileges granted to UPS will
enable the major international courier to elbow many of them out of
the market. This, in turn, will result in closures and the loss of
local jobs, they warned.
     UPS is the first foreign express courier that the government has
permitted to establish an Asia-Pacific freight center on the island.
The company also has been given special treatment, including 24-hour
customs clearance and quarantine and certification services.
     In December, UPS filed an application to set up the
multimillion-dollar center at the CKS airport. The government gave
the green light earlier this year despite protests from local
couriers which feared they would not be able to compete with the U.S.
delivery giant.

WTO talks end with Australia 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by Deborah Shen

     Following 14 rounds of bilateral negotiations, the ROC has
finally reached a consensus with Australia on the terms applicable to
the ROC's bid to enter the World Trade Organization.
     Australia now becomes the 11th WTO member country to have
completed bilateral talks with the ROC on membership terms, Lin
Yi-fu, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade, said.
     The two sides are expected to sign an accord on the agreed-upon
package of entry terms in the next few weeks. The finalized accord
will help speed up the ROC's admission into the trade body, Lin said.
     Lin was the chief ROC negotiator in what now appears to have
been the final round of WTO talks with Australia. During the Oct. 7-8
negotiations in Taipei, the two sides failed to resolve a major
sticking point which had lingered since the bilateral talks began
several years ago. That would be the ROC's tariff rate on imports of
Australian beef.
     At the conclusion of the Taipei negotiations, the Australian
delegation, headed by Graeme Thomason, said it would need to consult
with its government on proposals made by the ROC in the meetings. The
proposals included reductions on the tariffs which the ROC applies to
imports of Australian beef.
     Australia is the largest source of imported beef in Taiwan.
According to the Council of Agriculture, the island imported more
than 57,000 metric tons of beef and beef products last year, of which
about 30,000 metric tons came from Australia.
     Even so, Australian negotiators have long complained in the
bilateral WTO meetings that the ROC applies discriminatory treatment
to imports of Australian beef. In that the ROC classifies imported
beef from the United States as "special grade" and beef from
Australia as "ordinary grade," the Australian product falls into a
category with a higher tariff. This makes Australian beef less
competitive in the Taiwan market, they noted.
     Currently, the ROC government taxes special-grade imported beef
at a rate of NT$22.1 (US$0.80) per kilogram. Ordinary-grade imported
beef faces a duty of NT$30 (US$1.09) per kilogram.
     The ROC's initial stance was that it would not cut tariffs on
imported agricultural products until after gaining membership in the
WTO. The nation's negotiators decided to yield ground, however,
following President Lee Teng-hui's call for WTO talks with related
countries to be completed by next March so that the ROC can enter the
trade body before Hong Kong goes over to mainland China rule in July
1997.
     The nation's negotiators drew up a package of WTO entry terms,
adding in a key element--the beef tariff reductions long sought by
Australia. The proposal was presented to the Australian delegation
during the Taipei meetings in an effort to secure Australia's full
support of the membership bid.
     On Oct. 11, Australia notified the ROC that it had decided to
accept the beef tariff reductions as well as the rest of the entry
terms. The package of proposals is expected to boost the value of
Australia's overall exports to Taiwan by US$23.7 million annually.
     Under the accepted terms, the ROC will cut its tariffs on
Australian beef by 10 percent, lowering the duty from the current
NT$30 (US$1.09) per kilogram to NT$27 (US$0.98) per kilogram before
being admitted into the WTO. After membership is gained, the ROC will
further cut the beef tariffs over a period of six years to NT$15
(US$0.55) per kilogram.
     In other areas besides beef imports, ROC negotiators also agreed
to open the Taiwan market to 2,000 Australian-made compact cars for
the first time ever, beginning in 1997. After membership in the WTO
is granted, the quota will be gradually increased to 6,000 cars.
     The ROC also promised to double the annual import quota of 1,200
metric tons of Australian apples and allow Australian peaches, plums
and oranges to enter the Taiwan market for the first time ever, at
annual quotas ranging from 600 to 1,000 metric tons.
     The package of membership terms also includes measures to open
up Taiwan's financial and legal services and other service markets.
     The ROC applied to join the WTO's predecessor, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1990 under the name "Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu." Currently, the ROC
maintains observer status in the trade body.
     The 11 countries with which the ROC has completed talks under
the WTO framework include South Africa, Turkey, Malaysia, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, the Philippines, El Salvador, Colombia
and Uruguay as well as Australia.

Trade group arrives from mainland 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p2

by Weiling Liu

     A high-profile mainland Chinese trade delegation arrived in
Taiwan this week to meet with business leaders, tour industrial sites
and promote investment in the mainland.
     The 14-member delegation led by Guo Dongpo, chairman of the
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, was invited
for a weeklong visit by the China External Trade Development Council,
or CETRA, Taiwan's top trade promotion organization.
     Guo's position is equivalent to the rank of vice minister in the
mainland government, and the make-up of his delegation made it the
most influential to visit Taiwan since both sides began exchanges of
trade professionals last year.
     Other delegation members include Wang Wende, director of the
Office of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs under the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation; Zhang Yuqing, director of the
same ministry's Treaty and Law Department; and Xu Mang, director of
economic affairs of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.
     Guo said upon arrival that he hoped the trip would help to ease
tensions between Taiwan and mainland. "The main purpose of my
weeklong visit here is to call on my old friends as well as to make
new friends," he said. "I hope to meet with as many Taiwan business
and industry executives as possible to facilitate future development
of cross-Straits trade ties."
     Asked to comment on President Lee Teng-hui's recent warnings
about the risks of overreliance on trade and investments in the
mainland, Guo smiled but said nothing.
     During an Oct. 14 dinner hosted by CETRA Chairman Wang
Chang-ching, Guo said he wanted to understand Taiwan better and
intensify industrial and commercial exchanges. He said he had no
special intention to meet any high-ranking officials in the Mainland
Affairs Council, the ROC government's top agency for mainland policy.
     MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian had said three days earlier
that MAC officials would not hesitate to meet with the mainland
delegation. But Kao did not attend the Oct. 14 dinner even though he
had been invited. The MAC said that pressing matters had detained Kao
and that he would attend a party for Guo toward the end of the visit.
     MAC officials also did not attend CETRA's Oct. 15 welcoming
reception for Guo's delegation. Asked at the reception whether he
would like to meet with Kao, Guo replied: "I will follow the schedule
arranged by my host." Asked whether Guo's trade promotion council
plans to set up a liaison office in Taiwan, Guo said the council has
already built up regular dialogue channels with CETRA.
     Taiwan's intermediary agency for cross-Straits talks, the
Straits Exchange Foundation, which is affiliated with the MAC, also
appeared to keep its distance from the mainland delegation. Although
Chiao Jen-ho, SEF vice chairman and secretary-general, attended the
Oct. 15 reception, he stayed only briefly.
     Analysts suggested the response by the MAC and SEF reflected the
ROC government's decision to cool down trade and investment exchanges
with the mainland. In response to such suggestions, the mainland's
Wang said that massive amounts of capital from all over the world
have been funneled into the mainland's infrastructure market and that
Taiwan risks missing out on a golden opportunity.
     The delegation on Oct. 15 toured the Taipei International
Electronics Show at the Taipei World Trade Center and the next day
visited the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, the heart of
Taiwan's computer chip industry. On Oct. 17 the delegation planned to
tour the Kaohsiung-based China Steel Corp. and call on Kao Chin-yen,
chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries.
     The schedule for Oct. 18 included a seminar with Taiwan business
leaders and a meeting with SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu. A meeting with
Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National Association of Industry
and Commerce, was planned for the following day. The delegation was
scheduled to depart Taiwan on Oct. 20.

Opposition bars premier from power plant report 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p2

by Virginia Sheng

     A test of wills between the ruling and opposition parties
unfolded this week as Premier Lien Chan was blocked from entering the
Legislature to explain why the country needs a fourth new power
plant.
     On Oct. 15, Lien made several attempts to enter the Legislature,
where he planned to appeal to restore funding for the power plant
project. But on each attempt he was blocked by a human wall of
Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers.
     "It does not make any sense," Lien said in reaction. "The
Cabinet should be respected." He also made a thumbs-down gesture to
express his disappointment.
     Government Information Office Director-General Su Chi later
quoted Lien as saying that the incident was "a dark day for
democracy" in Taiwan. "They should try to convince people with
reason, but not through force," Lien said.
     Su added that the government welcomes any reasonable discussion
of policy but not irrational behavior. He said the denial of Lien's
entry has deprived the public of its right to learn about the
controversial project.
     At the core of the conflict is the project proposed by the
state-run Taiwan Power Co., the sole power supplier on the island, to
build a new nuclear power plant in the coastal township of Kungliao
in Taipei County.
     The project was first proposed in 1980 but was shelved in 1981
because the 1979 Three-Mile Island accident in the United States
focused public attention on safety.
     Safety concerns grew in the mid-1980s, prompted in part by fears
generated by the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl plant in former
Soviet Union and in part by operational flaws at Taipower's three
existing nuclear power plants.
     The proposal for the fourth plant won a legislative nod in 1992.
Two years later lawmakers approved a budget to cover the project for
the next seven fiscal years. Each year since then opposition
lawmakers have tried to block the funding.
     In a surprise move this year, the DPP and New Party lawmakers
teamed up on May 24 to pass a resolution that scrapped the budget.
Undaunted by the setback, the Cabinet on Oct. 8 sent the power plant
project back to the Legislature for reconsideration.
     The ruling Kuomintang is expected to override the opposition's
resolution on Oct. 18, as it needs the support of only one-third of
the lawmakers present to do so. The KMT controls 83 seats in the
164-seat Legislature.
     Furthermore, Lien said, the Legislature's original approval
should stand lest the nation's major policies be subject to constant
change by the lawmaking body at the expense of responsible politics.
     Suspension of the power plant project would mean a heavy
financial loss, would inevitably hurt the ROC's credit rating and
would erect an unnecessary barrier to Taiwan's bid to join the World
Trade Organization, Lien said.
     The Legislature was originally slated to hear Lien explain why
the plant was necessary on Oct. 15, discuss the issue on Oct. 17, and
then vote on the reconsideration proposal on Oct. 18. But the row
outside the Legislature disrupted this schedule.
     The row also had political implications beyond the power plant
itself, as it reflected a looming constitutional showdown between the
executive and legislative branches over Lien's serving simultaneously
as vice president and premier.
     But the opposition tactic itself came under heavy criticism, as
some said it used the letter of the law to violate its spirit. The
blocking tactic was carried out by through provisions in the law that
permit street demonstrations.
     Some feared that the Oct. 15 confrontation would build tensions
and close off room for discussion and peaceful settlement of domestic
political differences in Taiwan.
     While the power plant issue has been debated for more than 10
years without reaching a consensus, they said, the greater damage may
be to the island's democratic spirit.
     After Lien returned to his office, the Legislature approved a
motion raised by opposition lawmakers to adjourn the session. Among
the 145 legislators present, 75 supported the motion, 68 opposed and
two abstained.
     But before opposition deputies claimed victory, Legislative
Speaker Liu Sung-pan announced that the lawmaking body would vote on
the project on Oct. 18 without further debate.
     The announcement by Liu shocked the opposition lawmakers, who
accused the speaker of repeatedly violating the neutrality of his
position.
     The opposition also pointed to legislative rules. If the Cabinet
wants to reverse a legislative decision, they said, the premier must
first report to the lawmakers on why he wants the change before a
vote is taken.
     KMT legislators countered that Lien had intended to do so but
was barred by the opposition.
     "You opposition deputies have chosen to skip the review session
by dismissing the meeting," one KMT lawmaker said. "Although the
premier could not come into the Legislature to deliver his report, he
did send in a written report."

Justices open dual-status hearing 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p2

by Virginia Sheng

     The Council of Grand Justices on Oct. 16 heard arguments on
whether it is constitutional for the vice president to serve
concurrently as premier.
     The hearing, presided over by all 16 grand justices, was
prompted by a petition from the opposition parties claiming the dual
status violates the ROC Constitution.
     President Lee Teng-hui announced in June that he had retained
Lien Chan as premier after Lee and Lien were sworn in as president
and vice president in May. Lien had submitted his resignation as
premier to Lee, not the Legislature, and in retaining Lien as premier
the president did not seek legislative approval.
     The opposition lawmakers objected and petitioned the grand
justices to rule on the issue. In the meantime, opposition lawmakers
last month prevented Lien from making his administrative report to
the Legislature. This week they barred him from explaining the
Cabinet's energy policy.
     Before the Oct. 16 hearing began, the opposition insisted that
President Lee participate. The justices decided it would be
sufficient to send Lee a letter asking his opinions on the issue.
     Because the petition concerns the Presidential Office rather
than the Cabinet, the opposition also questioned whether it was
proper for Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao to defend for the
president since he is a Cabinet official.
     Liao, for his part, asserted that the grand justices should not
be ruling on the question in the first place because the dispute is
purely political and not constitutional.
     Citing former Vice Presidents Cheng Chen and Yen Chia-kan as
precedents, Liao said that serving in two posts at the same time
causes no difficulties in practice. Chen served as premier from 1958
to 1963 and Yen from 1966 to 1972. Liao also pointed out that the
Constitution does not state an objection to a dual status such as
Lien's.
     The opposition said the two precedents took place during the
martial law period, when some provisions of the Constitution were
frozen. They said the government is responsible to establish
constitutional precedents in the time since martial law was lifted in
1987.
     The opposition also urged the grand justices to rule not on the
basis of whether the dual status is practical, but whether it is
just. It is not a matter concerning Lien's ability to serve in two
positions at the same time, they said, but whether Lee has the right
to retain Lien.
     Justice Minister Liao emphasized that the ROC government is
neither a full parliamentary system nor a full presidential system.
Thus, he said, the grand justices must take political realities into
account. He said that the duties of both positions are clearly
defined in the Constitution and that there is no problem concerning
the compatibility of Lien's dual roles.
     Hu Fo, an academic and constitutional expert representing the
opposition parties, argued that the precedents do not make a valid
case. According to the Constitution, Hu said, the vice president is a
backup for the president while the premier should be held responsible
to the Legislature.
     What matters is that in retaining Lien without legislative
approval, the president acted without any check and balance, the
opposition argued. The opposition added that, should a president be
unable to finish his term, the vice president would succeed him and
in such a case confusion would arise if the vice president and the
premier were the same person.
     Lien resigned as premier in January, as required by the
Constitution, before the newly elected Legislature convened Feb. 1.
Lee then renominated him as premier and the nomination won
legislative approval.
     Lien resigned again before he was sworn in as the vice
president. In June, Lee announced that he had retained Lien as
premier. The opposition complained loudly because Lee's choice for
premier was not submitted to the Legislature for approval.
     The nine-hour hearing before the grand justices Oct. 16 ended
without any conclusion and was scheduled to resume Nov. 1, with
arguments centered on the relationship between the president and vice
president, the president and the premier, and the original design of
the Constitution. A ruling is expected in two months.

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p1

by FCJ Editors

     A Lafayette-class missile frigate, the Hsi Ning, was
commissioned Oct. 12 at the Tsoying naval base near Kaohsiung in
southern Taiwan. The 3,600-ton frigate, the second of six ordered
from France, is armed with torpedoes, U.S.-built surface-to-air
missiles, ROC-developed Hsiungfeng II anti-ship missiles, the Phalanx
rapid-fire gun system and advanced reconnaissance equipment. The
warship's surfaces are clad in high-tech composite materials that
make it far less detectable by radar, earning it the nickname
"stealth frigate." The ROC Navy ordered the six frigates from France
in 1991 as part of a 10-year plan to modernize the fleet. The Navy
has also leased Knox-class frigates from the United States and
ordered locally built Cheng Kung-class frigates patterned after
U.S.-made Perry-class frigates.

     The Russian Foreign Ministry has notified the ROC Foreign
Ministry that it will open a liaison office in Taipei in late
November. The Moscow-Taipei Cultural and Economic Coordination
Commission will be authorized to issue entry visas to ROC citizens
who want to visit Russia. Russia will thus become the 45th country
without formal diplomatic ties with the ROC to open a representative
office in Taiwan. Victor Trifonov is expected to be named the first
representative in the ROC.

All-party meeting sets up national conference plan 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p1

by Virginia Sheng

     The consensus-building conference proposed by President Lee
Teng-hui in his inaugural address this spring has been scheduled for
five days in late December, a top presidential aide said.
     Huang Kun-huei, secretary-general to the president, said the
National Development Conference will be held Dec. 23-28 at the Taipei
International Convention Center with the aim of building a consensus
on key concerns in order to formulate and implement policies.
     These and other details were agreed on during an Oct. 11 meeting
of the conference preparatory committee. Huang is executive director
of the 29-member committee, which was established on Oct. 5 by a
Presidential Office working group.
     Lien Chan, ROC vice president and premier, is the preparatory
committee convener. Deputy conveners represent each of the three
major political parties in Taiwan.
     The deputy conveners--the Kuomintang's Vincent Siew, the
Democratic Progressive Party's Chang Chun-hung, and the New Party's
Lee Ching-hua, said the first preparatory meeting was conducted with
mutual respect and a comprehensive exchange of opinions. Huang called
the meeting "harmonious" and the discussion "heated."
     President Lee told the committee that the conference will
fulfill the pledge in his May 20 inaugural address to invite opinion
leaders and representatives from all quarters to exchange views on
matters of far-reaching importance to the Republic of China.
     "After we accomplished the direct presidential and vice
presidential election on March 23 ... national development has strode
onto a new stage," Lee told the committee. "In the new system, how to
concentrate the experience and wisdom of our people to seek long-term
prosperity for the nation is the key to whether we can launch a
wide-ranging development program and enter the next century."
     The conference agenda will fall under three major topics:
constitutional reform and party politics, economic development, and
relations between Taiwan and mainland China.
     Possible subtopics include the governmental structure, electoral
system, taxation, financial liberalization, public facility
improvement, social security programs, balancing economic development
and environmental protection, cross-Straits relations and national
security, and the parallel policies of developing Taipei-Peking ties
and carrying out pragmatic diplomacy.
     About 150 delegates, including political figures, scholars and
other opinion leaders, will be invited to the conference. Vigorous
debates are expected on such issues as the relationship between the
president, the premier and the Legislature, the abolishment of the
provincial government and the policy toward the mainland.
     The committee also decided to hold 15 forums throughout Taiwan
to gather suggestions from the general public. Forums among overseas
Chinese were rejected owing to disapproval by opposition committee
members.
     In general comments, Chang of the DPP argued that the government
should consider the conference a forum to establish national policy.
If the conference is not empowered to lead to changes, he added, then
the DPP will withdraw from it.
     The New Party's Lee characterized the conference as a forum for
negotiation or coordination between political parties. He said the
meeting in effect will serve as another advisory board to President
Lee rather than as an extraconstitutional mechanism affecting
government operations.
     While the DPP favorably recalled the National Affairs Conference
in 1990 for laying down a good foundation for subsequent
constitutional amendments, the New Party disagreed. The New Party
also insisted that four subtopics be included on December's agenda:
administrative neutrality, judicial independence, military
depoliticization and media fairness.
     Such particulars and other matters--such as whether to frame the
conference around panel discussions and whether to prepare study
papers in advance--will be taken up in future preparatory meetings.
The next is set for Oct. 22. Committee members agreed that subsequent
meetings should be attended both by party-recommended representatives
and nonpartisan experts.
     As preparatory committee convener, Lien was praised for giving
all members plenty of time to express themselves, though some said
this led to inefficiency. The meeting exceeded its original two-hour
time frame by 90 minutes.

India: Solanki offers to resign AICC post

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  AICC general secretary, Mr. Madhavsinh Solanki,  today  took
the lead among the AICC office-bearers by offering to resign from
his post to enable the new party president, Mr. Sitaram Kesri, to
reconstitute  the AICC. According to sources, in a  brief  letter
addressed to the newly-appointed Congress president, Mr.  Solanki
has offered to demit office to enable Mr. Kesri to choose his own
team of office-bearers.

Mr.  Solanki's  offer  is bound to put  pressure  on  other  AICC
office-bearers to follow suit though all indications are that Mr.
Kesri has no intention at this juncture to reshuffle the AICC.
Another  general  secretary, Mr. Devendra Dwivedi,  had  gone  on
record  that the new president should have a free hand to  choose
his  own  secretariat. The observation of Mr.  Dwivedi  triggered
speculations that the AICC general secretaries may resign.
But the issue did not figure at the first formal meeting  between
the general secretaries and Mr. Kesri earlier in the day. Neither
any  of the general secretaries nor Mr. Kesri made any  reference
to the subject.

In  the course of the meeting the general  secretaries  discussed
the  issue  of  rescheduling  of  the  organisational  elections.
Immediately  after  the  appointment  of Mr.  Kesri  as  the  new
president,  the Congress represented to the  Election  Commission
seeking  extension  of  time till February end  to  complete  the
organisational elections.

Sri Lanka: 100 LTTE cadres killed in fighting

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. d

From Amit Baruah

COLOMBO, Sept. 26.

At  least  100 LTTE cadres were killed and scores of  Sri  Lankan
soldiers feared dead or wounded as the Tigers and the Army fought
their most fierce battles in the Vanni mainland during the  five-
day-old Operation Sath Jaya-III (True Victory-III) today.
A  military source said that the security forces, who claimed  to
have repulsed a massive LTTE counter-attack this morning west  of
Paranthan, had the bodies of some 100 Tigers in their possession.
Apparently, the security forces have also taken heavy casualties.
No details were, however, available of military dead or  wounded.
The Defence Ministry here maintained total silence on the  course
of fighting this morning.

An  official release merely said this morning:  "Latest  reports
indicate  that  the terrorists had launched  a  massive  counter-
attack during the very early hours of September 26 on the  troops
advancing  along the western flank. This counter-attack has  been
repulsed very effectively causing very heavy casualties among the
terrorists."

Earlier,  the military claimed that it continued to advance  both
east  and west of Paranthan in the Vanni mainland  amidst  fierce
resistance  from  LTTE cadres as 13 soldiers and 30  Tigers  were
killed in the last 24 hours.

"On  the  western  flank,  troops  captured  an  important  road
junction  by  the afternoon of September 26.  Terrorists  offered
heavy  resistance during this confrontation prior to the  capture
of the road junction," the Defence Ministry said in a statement.
According  to  the  release,  Sri  Lankan  troops,  after  having
captured  the Murasumoddai area east of Paranthan,  had  advanced
one more kilometre.

Meanwhile, the LTTE denied Government statements regarding  Tiger
casualties.  "There is no truth to the Sri  Lankan  Government's
claim  that  its troops have either killed or  wounded  100  LTTE
fighters on Tuesday..." the Tigers said.

According  to a Tiger release from London, the "actual  number"
of LTTE fighters killed in battle between Sunday and Tuesday  was
26.  Fourteen cadres were killed on Sunday, three on Tuesday  and
nine on Wednesday.

The  Tigers  also alleged that five persons were  killed  and  15
wounded  when  Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) aircraft  "attacked  a
large  crowd  of fleeing civilians"  moving  from  Puthumurippu,
Kilinochchi, yesterday.

India: Strategy for last phase of Jammu & Kashmir polls

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. c

From Our Special Correspondent

DODA, Sept. 26.

A  strategy has been worked out to ensure orderly,  peaceful  and
free  and  fair  elections  for the rest of the  six  out  of  87
Assembly  constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir in the  fourth  and
final phase of elections.

This is keeping in view the increasing number of bomb explosions,
attacks on the lives of candidates of pro-India political parties
and  their activists currently engaged in electioneering in  Doda
district to disrupt the conduct of elections on September 30. The
district is most prone to militant violence.

According  to  official sources, Army jawans  and  officers  will
command  and direct anti-militant operations in  the  mountainous
district  of  Doda spread over 11,600 sq. km. The  BSF  has  been
asked to continue anti-militant operations in close  coordination
with  the Army. But the maintenance of law and order will be  the
sole  responsibility of the State law and order  authorities  who
have  already  got deployed more than 500 companies of  the  BSF,
CRPF,  ITBP  and the Jammu and Kashmir Armed  Police.  They  will
provide  security cover to candidates and their  activists,  poll
conducting officers and all polling booths.

The Hindu-Editorial: Towards justice in Bosnia: "It is in the interest of
the former belligerents (in the Bosnian war) to have those guilty (of war
crimes) convicted" and to get rid of "these embarrassing figures"

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. c

By Vaiju Naravane

THE  war  in  the  former  Yugoslavia,  a  particularly  barbaric
conflict,  lasted  from  1991 to 1995 and  claimed  an  estimated
100,000  lives. Thousands of people both Serbs and  Muslims  were
tortured  or  detained in concentration camps,  women  were  mass
raped  and an estimated half a million people were driven out  of
their  homes.  In  1993  the  United  Nations  Security   Council
established  the International Criminal Tribunal for  the  former
Yugoslavia in an attempt to punish the Serbs, Muslims and  Croats
guilty of the worst atrocities. So far the Tribunal has  indicted
75 persons of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Of these 51
are  Bosnian  Serbs. These include the Bosnian Serb  leader,  Mr.
Radovan  Karazdic  and General Ratko Mladic who  are  accused  of
having  ordered, the massacres in Srebrenica where  an  estimated
5000  Muslims  were  killed. In addition Mr.  Karazdic  and  Gen.
Mladic  are  charged with genocide and  crimes  against  humanity
arising   from  atrocities  perpetrated  against   the   civilian
population  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  for  the  sniping   campaign
against  civilians  in  Sarajevo  and  for  the  taking  of  U.N.
peacekeepers as hostages and their use as human shields.
The President of the International Criminal Tribunal, Dr. Antonio
Cassese, an eminent Italian jurist, spoke to The Hindu on how the
tribunal has gone about its tasks and the problems it has  faced.
Excerpts from the interview:

The  Hindu:  This is the second time since World War II  that  an
international court has been set up to try war criminals. What is
the difference between this tribunal and that of Nuremberg?
Mr. Antonio Cassese: There are several differences. At  Nuremberg
you  had what has been called Victors' Justice. We  are  carrying
out  Victims' Justice. We can do this because this Court  is  not
the  projection of the four great powers which won the war as  in
the  case  of  Nuremberg,  but  the  expression  of  the   entire
international community. Of the 11 judges, only two are European.
The  others come from countries as far flung as Australia,  Costa
Rica,  China or Canada. The Nuremberg judges were  nominated.  We
were elected by the international community.

Secondly,  the  Nuremberg  court was set up at a  time  when  the
victors  had  total power and control over defeated  Germany  and
judges only had to demand documents or summon witnesses for it to
be done. This court was set up by the U.N. Security Council  when
the war was still going on. Since we don't have a judicial police
we  have to rely on the justice ministries and police  forces  of
the nations concerned to obtain evidence.

The  final difference with Nuremberg is that those  sentenced  by
this  court can appeal. For us a fair trial has become  something
of  an  obsession.  I always say that it is in  the  interest  of
Radovan  Karazdic  and Ratko Mladic to stand trial  because  they
will  be  assured of a fair trial and if they are  innocent  they
will be acquitted.

What are the instruments at your disposal?

We  don't have the kind of marvellous documentary evidence  which
was available to the Nuremberg prosecutors where every order  was
sent  in  quintuplicate. For certain crimes  committed  in  1990,
1991,  1992,  for  instance  in the case  of  mass  rape,  it  is
difficult  to gather direct medical evidence. Our  investigations
are therefore conditioned by the type of evidence we are seeking.
With little documentary evidence available we rely, above all, on
eyewitness  accounts. But often people who have witnessed  crimes
are  afraid  to testify because of possible  repercussions.  Fear
prevents  many  from coming forward. We do not have the  kind  of
eyewitness  protection programmes which exist in the U.S. We  can
protect  our  witnesses  only when they are here  in  Holland  by
disguising their voices or keeping their identities secret. I  am
now trying to set up a network of Non-Governmental  Organisations
which can help eyewitnesses before and after they testify. So  it
is very difficult to gather proof.

Of  the  75 persons accused of war crimes and/or  crimes  against
humanity only eight have been brought before the Court. How  does
the Court intend to see that justice is done?

Not  all  those  who  have been  arrested  are  minor  criminals.
Blaskic,  for  instance, is a general in the Croatian  army.  The
prosecutor  is  going  ahead with investigations and  no  one  is
excluded even at the highest levels. Secondly, we have invented a
special  procedure called Article 61, by which there will  be  no
trial  or  sentencing in absentia. Under this  procedure,  if  an
accused  fails  to  appear before the court,  we  call  upon  the
prosecutor  to  make  not  just the  charges,  but  the  evidence
gathered  against them public. Against Karazdic, for instance  we
have  the testimony of a Muslim who remained buried under a  heap
of bodies at Srebrenica. And we can make this evidence public. If
a  three-judge bench decides that the proof  presented  indicates
that the accused may have committed the crimes, an  international
warrant  is  issued via Interpol for the person's  capture  which
goes out to 200 countries around the world. And then we address a
letter  to  the head of the U.N. Security  Council  naming  those
States which have offered them protection or shelter. Last week I
sent  a  letter  to the U.N. Security Council  stating  that  the
Republic  of Croatia and the Bosnian Croat Federation had  failed
to arrest Ivica Rajic, a Bosnian Croat military leader. The  same
is true in the case of Karazdic and Mladic. The Security  Council
took  note of my letter and condemned the Governments  concerned.
Over a period of time such initiatives have a cumulative effect.
Who can arrest these criminals?

The  Dayton  accords have strengthened the Court.  They  make  it
binding   upon  the  Republika  Srpska  and   the   Bosnian-Croat
Federation  to cooperate with us and to give free access  to  our
investigators. This obligation has only been partly observed.  In
addition,  Article  9 of the accords forbids  anyone  accused  or
indicted by the Court to hold appointed or elected public office.
This  is  the  case of Karazdic. Croatia has now  adopted  a  law
calling  for cooperation with the Court and convinced Blaskic  to
appear  before the court. Drazen Erdemovic (charged with  killing
hundreds   of  unarmed  Bosnian  Muslims,  after  the   fall   of
Srebrenica)  was handed over by Belgrade. So something has  moved
since Dayton. The States concerned tend to look upon the  handing
over  of  their  citizens  as  extradition.  We  say  it  is  not
extradition, it is surrender. Last May we signed a memorandum  of
understanding  with NATO under which NATO forces have the  right,
not  the  duty,  but  the right,  to  arrest  these  alleged  war
criminals.  But NATO forces cannot easily arrest  these  accused,
who  always go about heavily armed or protected, without  risking
innocent human lives. And this I understand.

Prosecutor  Richard  Goldstone  (South  Africa)  left  the  Court
accusing  NATO  of "pusillanimity" for not  having  helped  you
complete your work. Do you share this view?

IFOR  or the U.N. implementation force has been in existence  for
the  past  nine months. And their mandate, which depends  on  the
politicians,  has  not  been revised or updated.  However,  I  am
confident  and  optimistic that the next few months  will  see  a
change.  This  view is based on several factors  including  talks
with relevant people. But I cannot tell you more.

I  would  want to see the arrest of all the big fish -  not  just
Karazdic  and Mladic. And I say that the arrest of  these  people
will have a salutory effect even on the peace process.

Will it be difficult to prove their responsibility?

Many  of these leaders never gave written orders. So  documentary
evidence,  unlike in the Nazi trials, is hard to find. But  there
is the concept of command responsibility or the responsibility of
the commanders, that is to say, besides the military  commanders,
the  heads of state or government who could be held  responsible.
They  could  be  accused  of crimes  of  commission  or  even  of
omission,  of  having failed to punish those  who  committed  the
crimes.  And it is here that the evidence produced at the  trials
of the small fry becomes important. This is how we can  construct
the  pyramid which leads to the very top. It will take us a  long
time, at least five to seven years to complete our work.
How do you respond to affirmations that the arrest of Karazdic or
Mladic will get the war going again?

This was true before the elections. I believe that the  elections
will  bring about a stabilisation of the political situation  and
perhaps  even  an  attempt at integration. I feel it  is  in  the
interest  of the various former belligerents to have  the  guilty
convicted by our Tribunal, to apportion blame, to rid  themselves
of  these  embarrassing  figures. It will be  in  their  economic
interest to do so because donor States could make development aid
conditional  to  the  resolution of this question.  Even  if  the
arrest of these figures leads to minor tension or friction in the
short run, it is better this way than to have war later on, since
most   of  the  persons  indicted  for  war  crimes   are   ultra
nationalists.

The Hindu-Editorial: A challenging Task

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. b

DESPITE  THE  SHORTFALL it experienced in  raising  the  targeted
internal  and  extra budgetary resources (IEBR) in  1995-96,  the
Karnataka  Government  has opted for a 40 per cent  rise  in  its
Annual  Plan outlay for 1996-97 at Rs. 4,360 crores.  Apparently,
the overall performance of the State's economy has encouraged the
Government to take an optimistic view on the prospect of  raising
IEBR  to the tune of Rs. 1,000 crores. The growth rate  in  State
domestic  product (SDP) is expected to go up to 5.3 per  cent  in
1995-96  from 4.8 per cent in 1994-95. Although its  debt  burden
stood at a staggering Rs. 8,704 crores at the end of 1994-95, the
State's  record in debt servicing has been fairly impressive.  As
the  ratio of interest payments to the State's  revenue  receipts
was about 10 per cent, the Government appears to be confident  of
its ability to raise both internal and extra budgetary resources.
The  step up in the Plan outlay calls for a budgetary support  of
Rs.   3,359.45  crores,  a  daunting  task  indeed.  As   Central
assistance and market borrowings have more or less been pegged by
the  Planning  Commission, the Government has to strive  hard  to
make  good  the shortfall by tapping its  internal  and  external
budgetary resources.

The  State Plan for 1995-96 was set at Rs. 3,575 crores, but  the
Government  stepped  up the outlay to Rs.  3,758.28  crores.  The
revised  Plan  called  for a budgetary support  of  Rs.  2,903.29
crores and mobilising IEBR of Rs. 854.99 crores. Following a huge
shortfall in the IEBR, the Government had to cut the Plan size to
Rs.  3,100  crores. The budgetary support also had to  be  scaled
down to Rs. 2,675.78 crores. Although some buoyancy was marked in
the tax and non-tax revenue receipts, the actual mobilisation  of
resources  fell far short of the targets. Failure of  monsoon  in
the  catchment  area hit the hydel power  generation  stations  -
Karnataka relies largely on hydel power - obliging the Government
to  raise  its  budgetary support to the power  sector  from  Rs.
220.84   crores  to  Rs.  344.51  crores.  The  resource   crunch
inevitably  led to scaling down the outlay on the  energy  sector
from  Rs.  689.06  crores  to  Rs.  515.98  crores.  The   actual
mobilisation of IEBR at Rs. 424.22 crores was barely half of  the
budgeted  estimate. Even as Karnataka claims to have the  highest
per  capita  Plan  expenditure, the shortfall  in  the  budgetary
support   in  funding  last  year's  Plan  had  undoubtedly   hit
developmental projects in the priority sectors.

As  the infrastructure projects claim a lion's share of the  Plan
outlays,  the Government has taken initiative to tap the IEBR  to
implement  them.  The  recent revision of  the  power  tariff  is
expected  to yield about Rs. 400 crores to the State  electricity
board.  The Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam has yielded Rs. 300  crores
and the Government appears to be confident of raising another Rs.
200  crores for the Upper Krishna Project (UKP) for  which  World
Bank assistance was expected earlier. With the Central assistance
pegged  around Rs. 378 crores, the State Government hopes  to  be
able to raise about Rs. 59 crores under different programmes. But
it is the irrigation sector that claims a major share of the Plan
outlay.  As the State is under considerable pressure with  regard
to  the  deadline to utilise the Krishna waters,  the  irrigation
sector  has  been  allocated  Rs.  1,168  crores.  The   proposed
expenditure of Rs. 1,000 crores on the UKP and Rs. 300 crores  on
the Cauvery basin project has far reaching political implications
for  the State. The increase in the size of the  district  sector
plan  to Rs. 732 crores from Rs. 620 crores  envisages  increased
responsibilities  for the Taluk panchayats in  rural  development
projects. Given its acute infrastructural problems, it remains to
be  seen whether Karnataka has learnt its lessons  in  mobilising
resources  and implementing its ambitious Plan without  cost  and
time over-runs.

The Hindu-Editorial: Arbitrary exercise of power

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. a

THE  SUPREME  COURT'S  strictures  on  the  former  Minister   of
Petroleum and Natural Gas, Mr. Satish Sharma, on his  "arbitrary
and  mala fide" orders of allotment of 15 petrol pumps not  only
reveal a shocking state of affairs governing the conduct of  some
public  functionaries in the discharge of their duties  but  also
expose the role played by them in distributing favours to all and
sundry  including friends, thereby violating all norms of  decent
public behaviour. Mr. Satish Sharma was one of those high profile
Ministers  who was considered a blue-eyed boy of the  late  Prime
Minister,  Rajiv  Gandhi, and was therefore in a position  to  do
whatever  he liked without being questioned. The allotment of  15
petrol pumps on the face of it is but a very small affair and yet
it  would  only show to what depths a Minister could  descend  in
using  his powers. Mr. Sharma could not have made any profit  out
of  these  transactions considering the fact that they  were  all
given  to  the relatives of Ministers and officials. And  it  was
precisely  keeping  this  fact  in mind  the  Supreme  Court  had
observed  that  no public servant could arrogate to  himself  the
power to act in a manner which was arbitrary.

There  was no doubt that the allocation was absolutely  arbitrary
in  nature  because no attempt was made to fix any  criteria  nor
were  particular rules and regulations governing such  allocation
observed  at all. Which in effect meant that the former  Minister
went about this business as if he was dealing with a matter which
had  no public ramifications and that the departments  under  him
were  treated  as his private domain where his will was  law.  It
goes  to  the credit of the Supreme Court that it had  come  down
heavily on the misuse of his powers in the field of  distribution
of  Government  wealth in various forms. The problem  of  ethical
conduct  for public functionaries, in fact, arises by  virtue  of
the power and influence they command and the commitment they have
to undertake of loyal and disinterested service to the public. If
on the other hand every public functionary at all levels begin to
feel that they have a right to use their powers either to  enrich
themselves  or  their close associates, the  administration  will
crumble.

The  Ministers  do have certain discretionary  powers  which  are
given  to them on practical considerations, to  avoid  procedural
delays and to achieve quick action by cutting red tape. These are
laudable objectives but it also means that such powers should  be
used  in  a  manner  totally consistent  with  the  values  of  a
democratic regime. It is often said that ethics in Government can
be no better than they are in society, that it is a reflection of
the values set within the community. This is taking an  extremely
cynical  view  of the real issue involved.  Public  functionaries
like  Ministers who claim to represent the people at large  could
well set the tone for the rest of the society. Lack of  integrity
and  probity  in  the discharge of public duties  and  the  utter
disregard  for  social  responsibility by  persons  in  authority
should  be effectively dealt with in the interests of creating  a
just  society in which every person enjoys the right to  equality
of  opportunity.  Mr. Satish Sharma must pay the  price  for  his
indiscretion.  The Supreme Court has pronounced its  verdict  and
the  question is whether Mr. Sharma has any chance of  explaining
his  conduct  in defence of his actions which have been  held  as
"utter  violation  of the law laid down by this Court  and  have
also  infracted  Article 14 of the  Constitution."  This  aspect
deserves  a deeper consideration especially when  the  allotments
are  stated to be within the category of "discretionary  quota"
given to the Minister as distinct from discretionary powers which
in  any case would have to be exercised in a  strictly  judicious
manner.

Heritage Day observed sans rancour in South Africa

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 11, Col. b

From M. S. Prabhakara

CAPE TOWN, Sept. 26.

The observance of Heritage Day (also known as Shaka Day,  marking
the anniversary of the assassination of King Shaka), which is one
of the 12 national holidays in the new South Africa, on  Tuesday,
was  notable  for the absence of rancour and  controversies  that
marked its observance in 1994 and 1995.

In  1994, the controversies arising out of the decision  of  King
Goodwill Zwelithini to invite the President, Mr. Mandela, for the
event  without routing that invitation through  his  `traditional
Prime  Minister' Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, marked the  open  split
between  the King and his kinsman, introduced a new element  into
the  fractured  and  tension-ridden  politics  of  KwaZulu-Natal,
further  embittering  relations all around. Following  this  open
confrontation  and  some ugly incidents, Mr. Mandela  decided  to
stay away from the ceremonies.

Last  year,  the King, now more alienated from his  kinsman  than
ever,  decided  not  to  take part  in  the  public  observances.
Addressing  a rally at Stanger in KwaZulu-Natal on that  day,  Dr
Buthelezi  said that the day would be remembered in  history  `as
the  day of the Zulu covenant'. "We are now moving  towards  our
liberation as one nation with one kingdom and one purpose.  Today
is  the  day of unity and the beginning of our  liberation,"  he
said.

On Tuesday, however, the King shared the stage at the King's park
stadium  in  Durban with the Premier of the  province,  Dr  Frank
Mdalsose  (who is also the National Chairman of the IFP) and  Mr.
Jacob  Zuma of the ANC. Observers believe that this marks  a  new
and more positive stage in the relations between the King and the
IFP. In the province itself, the relations between the leadership
of the IFP (which leads the coalition government) and the ANC  (a
junior partner) have been more visibly amiable for some time.
The highlight of the Heritage Day celebrations was the  unveiling
of  a memorial to Enoch Mankayi Sontonga, the composer  of  Nkosi
Sikelel  Africa  (God  Bless Africa), the moving  anthem  of  the
liberation movement, at the Bramfontein cemetery in  Johannesburg
by  Mr.  Mandela.  Mr.  Mandela  also  conferred  the  Order  for
Meritorious Service, Gold Class on the composer and presented the
award to Santonga's granddaughter; and named a park and street in
the vicinity of the cemetery after Enoch Santonga.

Little  is  known  about  Enoch  Santonga  though  his  song   is
universally  recongised by the African people on  the  continent,
and not merely in South Africa. Indeed, the anthem invokes divine
blessing on the continent and its people, and transcends national
identies; and is acknowledged and sung in many African  countries
as an anthem of struggle.

Sontonga  who was a priest and teacher died unhonoured  nearly  a
century  ago and buried in an unmarked grave.  Burial  registers,
where  he is identified only by his first name with  the  further
information that he was a `kaffir' (the pejorative term by  which
both the segregationist British colonial rulers and the apartheid
regime  which  further  refined on  its  predecessors'  cruelties
referred to the black people), record that he was buried on April
19  1905;  and  that he was 32 years of age at the  time  of  his
death.  Extensive  research undertaken after the  country  became
free  succeeded in locating the unmarked grave in the  segregated
section  of the cemetery. Indeed, this feature of  spatially  and
racially segregated burial sites is likely to continue in the new
South  Africa  far into the foreseeable future  even  though  the
Separate  Amenities Act and all other apartheid legislation  have
been scrapped.

India: Pak. trained ultra held

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 9, Col. b

From Our Staff Reporter

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  Special  Cell of the Delhi police claimed to  have  arrested
Kuldeep  Singh  alias Bitta alias Chaudhary,  a  Pakistan-trained
militant  belonging  to  the Khalistan  Commando  Force  (Panjwar
group) from a hotel in Paharganj. Kuldeep had come to the Capital
to  strike  here and eliminate important people. Nearly 3  kg  of
RDX, two timers and two detonators were recovered from him,  said
the police.

Addressing a press conference here today, the Deputy Commissioner
of  Police (Special Cell), Mr. B. S. Bhola, the suspect had  been
assigned  the task of killing moderate Akali leaders,  especially
Mr.  Prakash Singh Badal and those involved in the November  1984
riots.  Acting  on  this  information,  the  police  stepped   up
vigilance  and  started  checking hotels  and  guest  houses  and
managed to arrest Kuldeep.

During  interrogation Kuldeep told the police that  the  militant
leaders  like  Paramjeet Singh Panjwar, Lakhbir  Singh  Rode  and
Wadhwa  Singh  were  under tremendous  pressure  from  the  Inter
Sevices Intelligence of Pakistan to indulge in a major strike  in
India.  To  step up action, various Sikh  militant  organisations
have  come together and working under close cooperation with  the
Kashmiri militants including Lashkar-e-Toiba of Pakistan.
Mr.  Bhola said Kuldeep had entered India through  Chammb-Jhorian
border  in  Jammu  region in August 1996 with 10 kg  of  RDX,  10
timers and 10 detonators. The material was buried under sand near
Akhnorr  border  on the Indian side and he was asked  to  get  in
touch with other activists and establish hideouts for himself  in
Punjab  and Delhi. He was directed by Paramjeet to check in  some
hotel in Delhi and inform him about his location so that he could
direct other militants.

Kuldeep  had  been asked by Paramjeet to conduct a recce  of  the
vital installations, residences of the VIPs and those involved in
November 1984 riots. Mr. Bhola said Kuldeep had gone to Sofia  in
Bulgaria in 1990 on a genuine passport. From Sofia he shifted  to
Germany  and  subsequently to Belgium in search of job.  Here  he
came  in  contact with Prasan Singh, president  of  International
Sikh Youth Forum who motivated him to join the movement.
Mr.  Bhola  said he was sent to Pakistan in June 1992 on  a  fake
passport along with Sukhvinder Singh and Surjeet Singh Bhalla. At
Lahore  they were received by the Pak ISI agents and Bhai  Nishan
Singh  of KCF (Panjwar). Kuldeep Singh was imparted three  months
training  from June 10 1993 to August 30, 1993 in "Ilaka  Gair"
along  with 25 other activists. They were trained in handling  of
assault  rifles, pistols, LMG niper rifle, rocket  launchers  and
other explosives.

India: Malabar varsity to be called Kannur University

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 6, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Sept. 26.

The Malabar University's name was changed to Kannur University by
the Assembly this evening.

An official amendment moved by the Education Minister, Mr. P.  J.
Joseph,  for the purpose at the fag end of the discussion on  the
Bill  lead  to  noisy scene in the  House,  with  the  Opposition
registering its strong protest.

The  UDF members alleged that the change was being made  with  an
eye  on  the impending Thalassery byelection in which  the  Chief
Minister,  Mr.  E. K. Nayanar, is a contestant and  that  it  was
against the guidelines of the Election Commission. They said that
the  Education  Minister's  failure to disclose  at  the  Subject
Committee meeting that there was such a move was an insult to its
members and the House at large.

They alleged that it was also part of a move by the Government to
appropriate the parentage of the law. They asserted that whatever
the  Gvoernment  did,  the Bill would remain a  creation  of  the
previous  UDF  Government and its Education Minister, Mr.  E.  T.
Mohammed Basheer.

The ruling LDF, however, strongly defended the change saying  the
name  Malabar University was inappropriate for a university  with
jurisdiction  over only two districts and a taluk of the  Malabar
area.

They  also said that the Government did not need such as  gimmick
to ensure Mr. Nayanar's victory from Thalassery and that he would
win by a handsome margin anyway.

The  Education Minister too stoutly defended the name change.  He
said the name Malabar University was inappropriate as only two of
the  nine  taluks  of  the  old  Malabar  area  came  under   the
University.  Besides,  the old Kannur district consisted  of  the
area now brought under the University.

Mr.  Joseph also claimed to have held informal discussions  about
the  name  change at the Subject Committee meeting and  with  the
leaders of the Opposition parties. He added that the present Bill
was  more  democratic than the one drafted by  the  previous  UDF
Government.  The present law provided for election of members  to
the  various  University  bodies unlike the  earlier  Bill  which
envisaged nomination.

The Opposition, however, insisted on division and the name change
was accepted by the House by 63 votes to 34.

The Hindu-Editorial: Central Asia eyes Afghan corridor

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. e

From C. Raja Mohan

TASHKENT (Uzbekistan), Sept. 26.

Five  years after emerging as an independent nation,  Uzbekistan,
the  largest of the Central Asian republics, is striving hard  at
gaining  access to the sea. The quest for a reliable corridor  to
the  outside  world  has begun to influence  the  foreign  policy
thrust of the Uzbek Government here, most notably in Afghanistan.
Uzbekistan hopes that peace in Afghanistan will open a gateway to
the Indian Ocean through Pakistan.

As the land-locked Central Asian Republics struggle to  integrate
themselves into the world economy, the search for access roads to
the  sea has become one of the most important preoccupations  for
the  newly-independent  nations. Whether it is to  transport  the
abundant  oil  and natural gas riches of the region or  to  build
strong trade links with the rest of the world, securing  reliable
access lines to the sea has become vital for Central Asia.
The  problem  is  most  acute for  Uzbekistan  that  is  "double
landlolcked." It has to go through at least two countries before
touching  any  sea  port. On the  northern  side,  Uzbekistan  is
bounded by Kazhakstan and Russia. To the West, Uzbekistan has  to
pass  through Turkmenistan, the Caspian Sea - which is  itself  a
landlocked water body - and the Caucasus before it can reach  the
Black  Sea.  To  the East it has to  go  through  Tajikistan  and
traverse the entire territory of China to touch the Paciffic.  To
the South it has two options for getting to the Indian Ocean:  go
through  Turkmenistan  and Iran or go down  via  Afghanistan  and
Pakistan.

Centuries  ago, the fabled "Silk Road" of Central Asia was  the
artery  of trade between Europe and China as well as  the  Indian
sub-continent.  But once the sea routes between Europe  and  Asia
opened  up, and the Central Asian Khanates were  integrated  into
Czarist Russia and later the Soviet Union, the Silk Road lost its
glory. With Central Asian republics re-emerging after the fall of
the Soviet Union five years ago, rebuilding transportation  links
to the outside world is at the top of the agenda here.

While the travellers on the Silk Road had to face the unforgiving
elements  and  punishing bandits, trading along these  parts  now
faces  equally  daunting  obstacles:  many  national  boundaries,
transport tariffs and conflicts over agreements on anything  from
freight  forwarding paperwork to visa applications  for  drivers.
The  Central  Asian  governments as  well  as  international  aid
agencies  are helping develop new transportation projects in  the
region.  The focus is on creating multiple routes out of  Central
Asia  in order to limit the vulnerabilities of relying on  anyone
particular outlet.

As  part of its strategy of defining a new political  profile  in
the  regional and the international arena, Uzbekistan is keen  to
diminish  its  current dependence on the  Russian  transportation
networks  to the north. And Tashkent is looking at access to  all
the three seas - to the Black Sea in the west, to the Pacific  in
the  east  and the Indian Ocean to the south. The  Europeans  are
said  to  be enthusiastic about the routes between West  and  the
East  through Caucasus and Central Asia that will develop a  land
access  to  the Chinese market. The proposed network  could  also
include  spurs  to  the  South  through  Iran,  Afghanistan   and
Pakistan.

The  indications here are that the Uzbek Government has  set  its
sights on realising the Afghan-Pak. corridor to the Indian Ocean.
Officials and academic analysts here believe that the Afghan-Pak.
corridor  is the simplest and most attractive - economically  and
politically  -  to hook up with the rest of the world.  It  would
help  the  Central Asians with an important  alternative  to  the
current  dependence  on the Russians. Transportation  links  from
Uzbekistan  and Turkmenistan into Afghanistan and  Pakistan  will
also  help the Central Asians avoid a total reliance on Iran  for
access to the south.

The  dream of reaching the warm water ports of the  Indian  Ocean
faces  just  one obstacle: the instability  in  Afghanistan.  Nor
surprisingly,  Tashkent  has  stepped  up  its  efforts  to  draw
international  attention to the Afghan crisis. It has  taken  the
initiative  to call for an arms embargo against Afghanistan as  a
first  step  towards peace. Rapid developments on the  ground  in
Afghanistan  in the form of the recent military advances  by  the
Pakistan-sponsored Taliban against the Kabul Government, however,
may  have complicated the prospects for the Uzbek  proposal.  But
corridor is likely to be enduring.

International oil companies are also interested in developing the
Afghan-Pak.  corridor to transport the huge oil and  natural  gas
reserves in Central Asia. A western oil executive told The  Hindu
here  that  building  an oil  pipeline  through  Afghanistan  and
Pakistan could be "the catalyst for the economic  transformation
of  the  region." Road and rail infrastructure  could  be  built
along  the  pipeline  routes linking  Central  Asia  to  Pakistan
through  Afghanistan. An American oil company, Unocal,  has  been
pushing  the  proposal in Washington as well as  in  the  region.
Unocal  appears  bullish on the project, despite  the  widespread
scepticism about the prospects for peace in Afghanistan.
India will have to carefully consider the efforts to link Central
Asia  with Pakistan through Afghanistan and the  consequences  of
such   a   fundamental   geopolitical   restructuring   in    our
neighbourhood.  The first thing New Delhi needs to do is  to  pay
immediate   diplomatic   attention   to   the   developments   in
Afghanistan, that could emerge as the hinge between Central  Asia
and the subcontinent.

India: Andhra Pradesh releases water into Poondi canal

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 6, Col. d

From Our Staff Reporter

HYDERABAD, Sept. 26.

The  Andhra Pradesh Government has formalised the  dedication  of
the Telugu Ganga Project, a canal dug up to convey Krishna waters
to  Madras  for drinking purpose.  It released  Srisailam  waters
into  the Poondi canal, the last segment. The waters, drawn  from
Somasila  project but stored in Kandaleru, a balancing  reservoir
midway,  were released into the Poondi canal.

The release was made on Wednesday as announced earlier. The water
so  released  will reach Uthukottai, near  Poondi  reservoir,  on
September  29  and  the  Chief Minister of  Tamil  Nadu,  Mr.  M.
Karunanidhi,  will  receive the delivery of water at  the  border
village and, in turn, formally release into the Poondi  reservoir
at  a function to be attended by Mr. Manohar Joshi and Mr. J.  H.
Patel, Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Karnataka respectively.
Later  in  the  day, at another function  at  Madras  the  Andhra
Pradesh  Chief  Minister,  Mr.  N.  Chandrababu  Naidu,  will  be
felicitated  as  a  token  of gratitude  to  Andhra  Pradesh  for
implementation of the project against heavy odds.  The Tamil Nadu
Minister  for  Public  Works, Mr. Dorai  Murugan,  came  here  on
Thursday,  to  invite the Chief Minister,  the  Major  Irrigation
Minister, Dr. K. Sivaprasada Rao, and others.

Dr. Sivaprasada Rao questioned the propriety of some  Rayalaseema
politicians  belonging to the Congress(I) raising a bogey of  the
Government giving waters to Madras city without meeting the needs
of  their region. He blamed them for "the strange  inconsistency
in their stand" because the successive Congress Governments  did
not  oppose  the proposal and,  instead,   accepted  the  amounts
given by Tamil Nadu Government for implementation of the project.
"Had  they  been  sincere in their stand, they  would  not  have
accepted the money from Tamil Nadu in the first place," he said.
Dr.  Sivaprasada  Rao also said the agreement providing  for  the
Telugu  Ganga  Project was achieved between  the  three  riparian
States  of  Andhra  Pradesh, Karnataka  and  Maharashtra  at  the
instance  of Indira Gandhi and in the original project which  was
envisaged as a tunnel, there was no irrigation component at  all,
much less to benefit Rayalaseema. If the Congress leaders at that
time  had  been sincere enough about  serving  Rayalaseema,  they
would  have  prevailed upon Indira Gandhi for  inclusion  of  the
irrigation  component.  "But  they are raising  the  issue  now,
having kept silent then," he said.

Referring  to  the farmers of the region who were  agitated  over
conveying water to Madras, Dr. Sivaprasada Rao made it clear that
what   was  being  sent  for  the  present  was  3   tmcft,   the
contributions made by Karnataka and Maharashtra. Making reduction
in their original share by 5 tmcft each, these two upper riparian
States  had  already released that much quantum  into  Srisailam.
Andhra Pradesh would add its share only towards the fag end.
The  Minister  said it was not true that water was not  given  to
Rayalaseema  altogether  because an extent of  47,000  acres  was
already served with the Telugu Ganga in the region - 37,000 acres
in Kurnool district and 10,000 acres in Cuddapah. The  Government
would  need  at  least Rs. 1,000 crores to  complete  the  entire
project in its present form and it would fully spend the Rs.  100
crores allocated under the present budget.

Asked about the contributions made by the Tamil Nadu  Government,
the Minister said that what it owed towards the project was  less
than Rs. 10 crores.

India: How much water for Madras?

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 4, Col. e

From Our Staff Reporter

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

With  the  arrival  of  Krishna water  almost  a  certainty,  the
question  uppermost in the minds of people in Madras is how  much
extra water they will get.

At  present, 260 million litres of water is supplied to the  city
residents  daily. If three tmc ft comes, it means an addition  of
240 million litres daily (mld).

In  fact,  when Krishna water was scheduled to come to  the  city
last December, Metrowater had planned to increase the quantum  to
380-400 mld.

It is not known whether the authorities will now be able to stick
to  the  earlier plan as many aspects on water  availability  are
still not sorted out.

For  instance, officials are not clear on how much Krishna  water
will  be actually available for the distribution network and  how
long  the water will continue to flow as there are only a  couple
of  weeks left for the onset of northeast monsoon.  Moreover,  as
the  Kandaleru-Poondi  canal is a newly  constructed  one,  there
might be some teething problems and this could affect the pattern
of inflows.

In  view of these and other factors, any decision on increase  of
daily  supply will be dependent on the pattern of inflows. It  is
likely  that  the  officials will raise the supply  in  a  phased
manner.  Apart  from  the  quantum,  hours  of  supply  will   be
increased.

India: Shifting of refugees begins

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 4, Col. c

RAMANATHAPURAM, Sept. 26.

The shifting of refugees from the Mandapam camp, which is getting
filled  up due to the recent influx, began on Thursday  with  the
transportation  of  421  Sri Lankan Tamils to  various  camps  in
Tiruchi and Pudukkottai districts. The refugees, belonging to 100
families, were transported with armed escorts in seven buses.
The  Special Deputy Collector (Rehabilitation), Mr.  V.  Subbiah,
told  The  Hindu  at the Mandapam camp that  the  Government  had
planned  to accommodate the refugees at the camps  in  Kamarajar,
Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, South Arcot-Vallalar, Dharmapuri,
Tiruchi,  Pudukkottai,  Tiruvannamalai-Sambuvarayar,  Coimbatore,
Vellore-Ambedkar,  Salem,  Thiruvalluvar,  Periar  and   Dindigul
districts.  The  refugees  would  be shifted  in  batches  of  50
families to each district. Fifty per cent of Thursday's  despatch
included  those who had already been living in the Mandapam  camp
for  the past few years. Mr. Subbiah said about 300 families  had
expressed their willingness to go to the camp at Kottapattu  near
Tiruchi as most of their relatives were living in that area.

India: Effluents treatment: High Court direction to SIV

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 4, Col. a

From Our Staff Reporter

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

The  Madras  High Court has granted time till October 16  to  the
South  India  Viscose industries, Coimbatore, to  show  that  the
Lindox  Reactor  plant  installed by it  for  treating  effluents
reached  its optimum operation level and BOD would be reduced  to
the maximum extent.

A  Division Bench comprising the Chief Justice, Mr. K. A.  Swami,
and Mr. Justice A. R. Lakshmanan, passed this interim order on  a
writ appeal seeking immediate closure of the pulp unit of the SIV
at  Singanallur on the ground that the industrial effluents  were
polluting the waters of the Bhavani.

The  Bench said on October 17, a qualified engineer of the  Tamil
Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and also an engineer of  the
King  Institute,  Madras, should inspect the  industry  and  take
samples of water from the discharge point and also at each  point
of  100 metres upto 1,000 metres. They should test the  same  and
submit  a report with regard to the contents showing whether  the
BOD, COD and colour had been reduced and if so to what extent and
whether they were within tolerable limits.

Both the Board and the King Institute should submit the report to
the  court  in five sets on October 28. It was also open  to  the
industry  to  collect  the samples of water  and  have  the  test
conducted and submit its report also in five sets.

Referring  to the Board's plea for immediate closure of the  pulp
unit,  the Bench said in these cases, it was always the  question
of balancing public interest and the interest of the industry and
its  workmen.  The  Judges  pointed out  that  the  industry  had
employed over 3,000 workers and was in existence for a long time.
Moreover, 300 similar industries were functioning throughout  the
country. As the time sought for by the industry was not long, the
Bench  accepted  the request of the company to  grant  time  till
October 16, when the reactor would reach its optimum level.
Initially  the  SIV filed a writ petition  challenging  the  show
cause  notice issued by the Board on February 15, 1995 as to  why
the pulp unit should not be closed. Disposing of the petition,  a
single  Judge  directed the Board to give an opportunity  to  the
petitioner  to put forth its proposal for effluent treatment  and
to comply with the conditions imposed by the Board.

The  Bhavani  River Protection Joint Council,  which  got  itself
impleaded in the writ petition, preferred an appeal and submitted
that  it was high time the pulp plant was directed to  be  closed
down immediately to prevent pollution of the Bhavani river water.
It  said it was necessary to stop further discharge of  effluents
into the river to prevent injury to public health.

On  behalf of the SIV it was submitted that steps had been  taken
for effluent treatment by installing the Lindox Reactor Plant  at
a cost of Rs. 50 crores. It was making further efforts to  ensure
that  the  effluent was treated to the required  extent.  If  the
factory  was  ordered to be closed about 3,000 workers  would  be
rendered  idle. An opportunity might be given till October 16  so
that  the plant after reaching its maximum operation  bring  down
the BOD content to the tolerance limit which would in turn reduce
the COD and consequently the colour of water.

The  Board submitted that even if the strategy suggested  by  the
industry  was fully implemented, the COD would not be  completely
reduced  and  further  efforts  had to  be  made.  There  was  no
justification to permit the pulp plant to continue to operate any
more.

India: Parties flouting poll code

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 3, Col. b

From Our Staff Reporter

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

That  the civic polls are round the corner has been evident  over
the  past  couple  of  days  with  political  parties  and  their
candidates  putting  up flags, festoons and  even  an  occasional
`arch' in various parts of the city.

Flags  are  tied  to  ropes  and  hung  across  many  roads.  The
Corporation  lamp posts have come in handy for the  purpose.  The
parties do not seem to have taken the model code of conduct  laid
dawn  by the State Election Commission, for the elections to  the
urban local bodies, seriously.

Section  11  (General)  in  Booklet 3  says  that  'no  party  or
candidate  shall permit its/his followers to use any  private  or
public  property  for erecting flag staffs or  cut-outs,  pasting
notices, posters or writing slogans or suspending banners without
the written permission from the owner of the property  concerned;
and  where such permission is obtained, a copy of the same  shall
forthwith be sent to the District Election Officer and in case of
Corporation to the Returning Officer.'

But  Corporation  sources  said permission is  not  accorded  for
erection  of  structures  across roads,  putting  up  banners  or
festoons.

A  trip  round the city reveals that parties have not  taken  the
rules seriously. Flags tied to ropes have been hung between  lamp
posts across the road Dr. Radhakrishnan Salai, Gopalapuram,  Anna
Nagar 2nd avenue, Nelson Manickam Road, Sterling Road, Muttukkadu
Road,  L.  B. Road, Greenways Road, V. K. Iyer  Road,  Royapettah
High  Road  and Srinivasa Avenue (RA Puram).  The  barricades  on
medians have also come in handy to install the flagstaff.
The ruling party flags and festoons are the most `visible' of the
lot; followed by the TMC, the odd Rajni Rasigar Mandram flag and,
at a couple of places, AIADMK.

Loudspeakers,  especially  the cone type, too have  been  working
overtime  - either blaring music or the voices  of  propagandists
canvassing votes for a particular candidate. The code of  conduct
(Section 13, General) says that "loudspeakers shall not be  used
to  transmit  music or songs".

China may back India for U.N. Council seat

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. f

From R. Chakrapani

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26.

In  the forthcoming elections for the non-permanent seats in  the
Security Council, the United States is known to be backing  Japan
but  India is not altogether without support from  the  Council's
permanent members.

Russia  is  believed to have indicated to  the  External  Affairs
Minister, Mr. Inder K. Gujral, that it will vote for India.
Another  surprise  development  is said to  be  that  China  will
support India. There are signs that relations between Beijing and
New  Delhi are warming up with a projected visit to India by  the
Chinese  President, Mr. Jiang Zamin. The Chinese  relations  with
Japan  are not at its best currently. A Chinese statement in  the
General  Assembly  also showed that Beijing is concerned  at  the
dangers  inherent  in  a unipolar world if it  was  going  to  be
dominated  by a single super power - the United States. The  same
statement,  delivered by the Chinese Foreign Minister,  Mr.  Qian
Quichen also gave his support to the Non-Aligned Movement voicing
the concerns of developing countries.

Mr. Gujral was asked about the chances of India succeeding in its
efforts  to get elected to non-permanent seat falling  vacant  to
the Security Council from the start of the new year. "We have  a
fighting  chance  to win" replied Mr. Gujral. "If  we  did  not
win,"  he  said,  there  was no reason  why  India  should  feel
disappointed. "But I do think our chances of getting elected are
reasonably good."

Delhi to host NAM meet

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. e

From R. Chakrapani

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26.

The  next  meeting  of the Inter-Ministerial group  of  the  Non-
aligned  countries will be held in New Delhi, it was  unanimously
decided at a meeting of the group here on Wednesday. The meeting,
which  could be held in April or later, will be  of  significance
because  it  will  define  issues to be  brought  up  before  the
Nationalised Summit meeting, probably to be held in South Africa.
At  a  meeting  of  the  ministerial  group  held  at  the   U.N.
headquarters,  and  attended  by a  large  number  of  Nonaligned
Foreign  Ministers,  the  External Affairs Minister,  Mr.  I.  K.
Gujral,  offered  to host the Inter-Ministerial  meeting  in  New
Delhi  and this was readily endorsed by Egypt and  several  other
countries.

About  40  Ministers participating in the  discussions  made  the
point  that  the  Nonaligned  movement  had  not  only  lost  its
relevance in the post-Cold-War era.

Earlier,  Mr. Gujral spoke of the "new challenges"  that  would
confront the Nonaligned movement in the post-Cold-War period  and
it would be necessary for these countries to face them  unitedly.
"These   challenges,"  he  said,  "are  posed  by  forces   of
extremism,  ethnic  discord, terrorism  and  growing  disparities
across  the  globe.  To these challenges, we must  add  those  of
nuclear disarmament, and economic and social development."
He recalled the struggle of the nonaligned countries in the  area
of  nuclear  disarmament,  and explained why  India  opposed  the
Comprehensive  Test  Ban  Treaty. It would  be  apparent  to  any
impartial  observer  that  the  CTBT text  did  not  reflect  any
meaningful  commitment  to the cause of global peace  or  nuclear
disarmament.  The  treaty,  in  its  essential  form,  sought  to
perpetuate the discriminatory and highly unequal status quo "for
all times".

It was necessary for the Nonaligned movement, Mr. Gujral said  to
work for a world free of nuclear weapons and the Nonaligned forum
was   the  most  appropriate  platform  to  achieve  the   common
objectives and shared visions.

Mr.  Gujral also referred to India's bid to seek a  non-permanent
seat in the U.N. Security Council in the vacancy to be caused  by
Indonesia's exit. He sought the support of Nonaligned  countries,
pointing  out  that  if India lost the fight,  it  would  deprive
representation for the movement.

Mr.  Gujral exchanged views on bilateral and multilateral  issues
with  more  visiting  Foreign Minister,  including  Russia's  Mr.
Primakov and Ministers from the European Union.

India: High Court rejects Rao"s plea for anticipatory bail

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. d

From Our Staff Reporter

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  Delhi High Court today dismissed the former Prime  Minister,
Mr.  P. V. Narasimha Rao's petition for anticipatory bail in  the
$100,000  Lakhubhai  Pathak cheating case, in which he  has  been
summoned  by a trial court here to appear before it on  September
30.

Mr. Justice S. K. Mahajan dismissed Mr. Rao's petition  observing
that it was not maintainable. "It should be left to the  regular
court  to  deal with the matter on the accused  appearing  before
that court," he observed.

"As  only  summons  have  been issued by  the  trial  court  for
appearance  of  the petitioner (Mr. Rao) on September  30,  there
cannot be any apprehension of his arrest before he appears in the
court," Mr. Justice Mahajan noted in a four-page order.
The  Judge passed the order after hearing arguments by Mr.  Rao's
counsel,  Mr. Kapil Sibal, and counsel for the CBI, Mr.  S.  Lal.
The  court  was packed to capacity during the  proceedings  which
lasted for 25 minutes.

The Special Judge, Mr. Ajit Bharihoke, on September 21  dismissed
an application by Mr. Rao seeking recall of the summons issued to
him earlier by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mr. Prem Kumar,
and issued new summons to him to appear in his court on September
30.

Arguing on the application today, Mr. Sibal submitted that  since
the offence was non-bailable, the former Prime Minister would  be
arrested immediately on his appearance in the trial court and  he
would  have to make an application for bail. Mr. Sibal  expressed
fear that the trial court might not grant bail to Mr. Rao when he
appeared before it on September 30.

In  this regard, Mr. Justice Mahajan observed in his  order  that
"the  contention of Mr. Sibal that even in a case where  summons
have  been  issued  by  the  trial  court  for  appearance,   the
petitioner  is entitled to move this court for anticipatory  bail
is not correct".

"It  is  only in the case of non-bailable warrants  having  been
issued  and  in  the case of apprehension by the  accused  to  be
arrested  before  he appears in the court, which had  issued  the
non-bailable warrants, that there is an apprehension of arrest by
the  accused.  In the present case, in my opinion,  there  is  no
apprehension of arrest of the petitioner till the time he appears
in the trial court."

Opposing  Mr. Rao's petition, Mr. Lal contended that there  could
be  no  apprehension on the part of Mr. Rao as it was  a  summons
case.  The petition of Mr. Rao seeking anticipatory bail was  not
maintainable, he submitted.

About Mr. Sibal's submission that Mr. Rao be granted anticipatory
bail  by the High Court as was granted to the BJP leader, Mr.  L.
K. Advani, in the multicrore Jain hawala case, Mr. Lal  contended
that  the  case  of  Mr. Advani  was  different  as  non-bailable
warrants had been issued against him by the court.

India: CBI chargesheet Rao in St. Kitts case

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  former  Prime Minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao,  and  three
others, including the self-styled godman Chandraswami, were today
chargesheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the
St. Kitts Forgery case.

The  CBI  also named the former Minister of  State  for  External
Affairs,  Mr.  K. K. Tewary and Mr. Kailash Nath  Aggarwal  alias
"Mamaji,"  close  associate  of  Chandraswami  in  the  15-page
chargesheet  filed in the court of Mr. Prem Kumar, Delhi's  Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate.

A. P. Nanday, former Deputy Director, Enforcement Directorate and
George D. McLean, Chairman of the First Trust Corporation Bank in
St. Kitts, also figure in the chargesheet. However, the two  have
since died and the proceedings against them have terminated.
Mr.  K. L. Verma, former Director in the Enforcement  Directorate
and  Mr. Larry J. Kolb, a relative of the arms dealer  Mr.  Adnan
Khashoggi, were named as accused in the chargesheet but there was
no  sufficient evidence against them. The CBI has  requested  the
Court  that the two may be discharged. The chargesheet will  come
up  for further consideration before the Court on October 1.  The
judge   directed  the  CBI  to  file  supporting  documents   and
statements before the next date of hearing. Both Chandraswami and
Mr.  Aggarwal  are now lodged in the Central Tihar Jail  here  in
connection with the Lakhubhai Pathak cheating case.

The  chargesheet came a day before the scheduled hearing  of  the
St.  Kitts  case tomorrow in the Supreme Court. The  CBI  had  on
September 9 told the apex court that it would be in a position to
apprise   the   court  of  "definite   actions"   relating   to
investigations in the case.

According to the chargesheet, the CBI investigation revealed that
the  persons accused, in conspiracy with each  other,  fabricated
evidence with the intent and knowledge to cause the former  Prime
Minister, Mr. V. P. Singh and his son, Mr. Ajeya Singh, convicted
of  the offence under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act  (FERA)
and  the  Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) and  to  harm  their
reputation in the eyes of the public.

The  chargesheet  refers to the report of the  auditors  who  had
scrutinised  the accounts of the First Trust Corporation Bank  in
the  Carribean island of St. Kitts. It says that the account  was
opened  on  September 16, 1988 and closed on February  13,  1989.
Incidentally, both the days were public holidays in St. Kitts.  A
total amount of $21 millions was deposited and withdrawn from the
account.

The four accused, including Mr. Narasimha Rao, have been  charged
under  Section 120-B read with Sections 195, 469 and 471  of  the
Indian   Penal  Code.  The  provisions  relate   to   conspiracy,
fabrication  of false evidence with intent to procure  conviction
of  offence punishable with imprisonment of seven years or  more,
forgery and using forged documents.

The  chargesheet said that as the Minister of State for  External
Affairs,  Mr.  Tewary  had called for  the  file  containing  the
application  for  passport  of  Mr.  Ajeya  Singh  to  trace  his
signatures  which  were  allegedly  forged  later.  This  showed,
according  to  the chargesheet, that Mr. Tewary  knew  about  the
conspiracy right from the initial stage.

The chargesheet was filed six years after the CBI registered  the
FIR in the case on May 25, 1990. The Supreme Court had pulled  up
the  CBI in April last for dragging the investigations.  It  said
that if the situation had reached a stage where no candid  result
could be achieved, the Court might be forced to record a  finding
that the investigating machinery had come to a grinding halt.
The case had been gathering dust until the end of last year  when
the Supreme Court had brought it back to life following a  public
interest petition moved by Mr. Anukul Chandra Pradhan,  advocate,
seeking  the Court's directions to the CBI and other  authorities
to conduct an expeditious probe.

The  FIR had referred to the alleged role of Mr.  Narasimha  Rao,
then  External Affairs Minister in the Cabinet of Prime  Minister
Rajiv Gandhi, as well as of Capt. Satish Sharma and others in the
forgery conspiracy but none of them was mentioned as "accused."
The  St. Kitts case relates to the opening of a bogus account  by
alleged  forgery of bank documents to show that Mr.  Ajeya  Singh
had  stashed  away  a large amount of forex in  the  secret  bank
account.  The documents pertained to the bank account alleged  to
have  been  in  the name of Mr. Ajeya Singh,  maintained  in  St.
Kitts.  The  whole exercise, according to the CBI, was  aimed  at
defaming Mr. V. P. Singh, potential rival of Rajiv Gandhi.
On  the role of Mr. Narasimha Rao, the FIR said that  during  his
stay  in  New  York between September 25 to October  5,  1989  in
connection  with  the  U.N.  General  Assembly  session,  he  had
instructed  Mr.  R. K. Rai, then India's  consul-general  in  New
York,  to  authenticate  certain  documents.  Telephonic  contact
between Mr. Rao and Mr. Khashoggi reportedly took place at  23-06
hours on October 3 and at 09-42 hours, the Counsellor had met Mr.
Rao in his hotel suite.

The  entire  exercise  was  allegedly done  at  the  instance  of
Chandraswami  alias Nemi Chand Jain who had urged the  Government
to  send a team of officials to probe the alleged account of  Mr.
Ajeya  Singh in St. Kitts. A team, comprising the then  Chief  of
the  Enforcement  Directorate,  Mr. K. L. Verma  and  the  Deputy
Director,  A. P. Nanday, had visited the island and  returned  to
New  York with photocopies of some documents which were  attested
by George McLean.

Nanday  was deputed by the Rajiv Gandhi government in  September-
October 1989 to inquire into "reports" that Mr. Ajeya Singh had
a foreign bank account. He conducted investigation in the  "full
knowledge"  of  Chandraswami, Mr. Aggarwal,  George  McLean  and
Larry  Colb.  Nanday had also avoided  Indian  Embassy  officials
throughout  his  stay abroad and was  Chandraswami's  guest.  The
godman  was  staying in Mr. Adnan Khashoggi's  apartment  in  the
Olympic Towers.

While  in  New  York, the officials sought  directions  from  the
Government and were told that the documents should be attested to
by some officials of the Indian Embassy in the U.S.  Accordingly,
the help of Mr. Narasimha Rao was sought as he happened to be  in
New York as part of his scheduled visit. He then asked Mr. Rai to
attest  the documents which would be brought by the officials  of
the  Enforcement  Directorate.  The  allegation  was  that  while
Chandraswami's  secretary was the "master forger," Mr. Rao  had
ordered Mr. Rai to authenticate the documents.

According to the chargesheet, Mr. Rao who was staying at the U.N.
Plaza hotel was contacted on telephone by Chandraswami on October
3,  1989. A day later, Mr. Rao contacted Mr. Prakash  Shah,  then
Additional Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, in connection
with the authentication of the documents.

The  chargesheet  said that on October 6, 1989 Mr.  Aggarwal  had
called Mr. Shiv Kumar, Indian High Commissioner in Port of Spain,
and  introduced him as a family friend of Mr. Narasimha  Rao.  He
asked the official to go to St. Kitts and meet the Prime Minister
there and inquire about the affair. He had also made a  telephone
call to Mr. S. C. Gupta, then Second Secretary in the Indian High
Commission  in Port of Spain, and virtually dictated a letter  to
him to be sent to St. Kitts.

India: Villagers flee as Pak. firing intensifies

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. a

From Our Correspondent

SRINAGAR, Sept. 26.

The hostilities on the India-Pakistan border in northern  Kashmir
has  intensified  in  the last three days,  leaving  hundreds  of
people homeless.

Most  of  the projectiles fired from across the  border  hit  the
civilian  targets,  creating  panic among the  masses.  When  the
firing  did not stop on Tuesday, the people had no option but  to
flee. Large-scale migration started on Wednesday.

Indian fiscal deficit is unsustainable: Camdessus

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. b

From Sridhar Krishnaswami

WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.

The  Managing  Director of the International Monetary  Fund,  Mr.
Michel   Camdessus,   has  termed  the  Indian   fiscal   deficit
`unsustainable' and has called upon New Delhi to cut this in half
over the next five years.

Answering  a  question  at a press conference  this  morning  the
Managing  Director of the IMF made the point that while India  in
the  last  few years had solved a few problems such  as  external
financial  vulnerability  and  reducing inflation,  the  pace  of
fiscal  consolidation  seemed  to be  concentrated  only  on  the
Central  Government side. The overall public sector deficit  that
would  have to include the Centre and State governments  and  the
public sector enterprises came to over nine per cent of the Gross
Domestic  Product  and this was not  sustainable,  Mr.  Camdessus
remarked.

The  issue  of fiscal deficit is expected to figure high  on  the
agenda  in  the  meeting between Mr.  Camdessus  and  the  Indian
Finance Minister Mr. P. Chidambaram during this year's meeting of
the World Bank and the IMF.

The argument of Mr. Camdessus has been that if the problem of the
fiscal  deficit  was  not addressed  this  would  jeopardise  the
investment  needed for sustained high growth, and if  allowed  to
continue  there  was  the  potential  of  the  risk  of  external
vulnerability re-emerging.

The  IMF Managing Director said that while there was no  dramatic
solution to the problem, the fiscal deficit could be halved  over
the  next five years. Last week a senior official of the IMF  had
suggested that the programme of halving the fiscal deficit over a
five  year  period could be done at the rate  of  one  percentage
point a year. Today Mr. Camdessus argued that while taking  steps
to  come  to  grips with the fiscal  deficit  India  should  also
simultaneously develop efforts on the structural side that  would
help  do  away  with the quantitative  restrictions  in  imports,
continuing  the  financial reforms and the reform of  the  public
enterprises, besides opening much more broadly the big domain  of
public infrastructure to private investment.

India: PM takes oath as RS member

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The Prime Minister, Mr. H. D. Deve Gowda was today sworn in as  a
member  of  the Rajya Sabha. He had been elected  unopposed  from
Karnataka.  The Prime Minister was administered the oath  by  the
Secretary General of the Rajya Sabha, Mrs. V. S. Rama Devi in the
chamber of the Rajya Sabha Chairman, Mr. K. R. Narayanan.
Besides the Vice-President, Mr. Narayanan, the Railway  Minister,
Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan, the Information and Broadcasting  Minister,
Mr.  C.  M. Ibrahim, the former Finance  Minister,  Dr.  Manmohan
Singh, Mrs. Margaret Alva and Mr. S. S. Ahluwalia (all  Congress)
Mr.  Satish Aggarwal and Mr. T. N. Chaturvedi  (Bharatiya  Janata
Party) attended the oath-taking.

Mr.  Gowda,  thus  became  the  first  Prime  Minister  to  enter
Parliament  through the Rajya Sabha. In 1966, when Indira  Gandhi
was  elected leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party, she  was
already a member of the Rajya Sabha. In 1991, Mr. P. V. Narasimha
Rao  chose to enter the Lok Sabha by contesting from the  Nandyal
constituency.

`No threat to Govt.'

The Prime Minister was reported to have said that there could  be
no threat to his Government owing to the change of leadership  in
the  Congress. According to Mr. Gowda the decision to  support  a
non-BJP  formation was taken by the Congress  Working  Committee.
The  implication  was  that it was not  a  private  understanding
between  Mr.  P.  V.  Narasimha Rao and  him;  rather  it  was  a
political  commitment  made  in a particular  context  which  had
remained unchanged.

India: BJP to move High Court on irregular land deals

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 6, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

BANGALORE, Sept. 26.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to approach the High
Court through public interest petitions challenging the irregular
land and other deals which had resulted in huge loss to the State
exchequer   as   the   Government  seemed  to   be   unmoved   by
representations and agitations.

This  was stated here today by Mr. B. S. Yediyurappa,  Leader  of
the Opposition in the Assembly.

The  party would come out with a "public  chargesheet"  against
the   Government  about  the  several  irregular  deals   to   be
distributed  among the public as it had done successfully  during
the Chief Ministership of Mr. S. Bangarappa.

Mr.  Yediyurappa mentioned of a transaction involving  about  300
acres  of  Government  land estimated to cost  around  Rs.  1,000
crores near Bidadi coming under Ramanagaram Assembly constituency
represented  by  the Prime Minister, Mr. H. D.  Deve  Gowda,  and
"misuse of funds" in road laying in new Bagalkot town.

Participating in a meet-the-press programme, Mr. Yediyurappa said
only  two years ago the authorities had spent Rs. 4.5 crores  for
laying a 7.5 k.m. stretch of metal roads in the new Bagalkot town
which  worked out to Rs. 63 lakhs per k.m. This was  the  highest
rate ever paid. The authorites had invited tenders for a  similar
road for which the cost specified was Rs. 23 lakhs, which clearly
indicated misuse of at least Rs. 3 crores earlier.

Mr.  Yediyurappa said several such cases had been highlighted  by
him  during  the discussion on the no-confidence  motion  in  the
Assembly  recently,  but  the House  had  been  adjourned  amidst
confusion without a reply.

Describing  the 118-day-old Government headed by Mr. J. H.  Patel
as  one  that lacked political stability and direction,  the  BJP
leader  said it was "an orphan" supported neither by the  Prime
Minister  nor the Ministers and legislators of the ruling  party.
The  hope  that  with  Mr. Patel  becoming  Chief  Minister,  the
Congress  culture would go had been belied as he was  looking  to
Delhi  for  everything  and was in the clutches  of  the  excise,
granite and land grabbers, he added.

Mr. Yediyurappa said the only strength of the Janata Dal, both at
the  State  and in the Centre, appeared to be  the  weakness  and
factional   fight  in  the  Congress.  The  Prime  Minister   was
blackmailing  the  Congress leadership and even hijacking  it.  A
beginning had been made with the weaning away of Mr. Ajit Singh.
He  said  the  State Government was  not  taking  the  Opposition
parties into confidence while dealing with important issues  such
as  river water. Even an attempt was made to mislead them on  the
nature of talks and the understanding arrived at with Tamil  Nadu
during  the  Cauvery water talks recently. The  talks  themselves
were  stage-managed to save the chair of the Prime  Minister  and
the  State Chief Minister. Similarly, the Alamatti Dam issue  was
being treated as if it was a party affair, he said.

Mr.  Yediyurappa  said he recently visited the  Tungabhadra  left
bank  area where an aqueduct had collapsed. The canal itself  had
been  repaired 176 times in the last 45 years. One  estimate  put
the current crop loss at Rs. 500 crores.

Mr. Yediyurappa, who has just returned from a tour of the  State,
said  he was confident his party would win at least four  of  the
six  Assembly seats it was contesting. The party  was  supporting
independents in two constituencies as its aim was to see that the
Janata Dal was defeated.

Mr.  Ramachandra Gowda, MLC and vice-president of the State  unit
of the party, said that completion of 118 days in office was  the
only  achievement  of  Mr.  Patel.  The  ruling  party  was   not
concentrating  on  administration  as it was not  sure  when  the
Government would come down because of instability.

Replying  to  a  question, Mr. Yediyurappa  said  the  party  had
decided to support any candidate to be fielded by the Congress or
the  Rashtreeya Nava Nirmana Vedike in the election to the  Rajya
Sabha.  But  because  of  the decision of  the  Congress  at  the
national level not to field a candidate and the difficulty of the
latter  in fielding a candidate without involving an  element  of
risk  to  the ruling party legislators  supporting  the  nominee,
there was no choice except to keep out of contest.

Mr.  Yediyurappa denied there was any understanding  between  the
Prime  Minister and the BJP president, Mr. L. K. Advani,  not  to
field  a  BJP  candidate against Mr. H. D. Deve  Gowda.  He  also
denied  there was any alignment with the Vedike. It was  only  an
understanding  to  defeat the Congress and the Janata  Dal  which
were two sides of the same coin, he added.

To  another question, Mr. Yediyurappa said Mr. Hegde had his  own
contribution  to the Janata Dal coming to power in the State  and
Mr.  Gowda  becoming the Prime Minister. In the  State  political
interest,  the BJP had to support his stand.  The  meet-the-press
programme  was organised jointly by the Press Club  of  Bangalore
and Bangalore Reporters' Guild.

The Hindu-Editorial: Hares, hounds and lawyers: Lawyers must consciously
project the counter image that they are mediators of accountability and
not for political, financial or any other kind of hire in public interest
litigation

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. c

By Rajeev Dhavan

JOKES about lawyers are increasing. If earlier 'legal` joke books
carried  innocuous  titles like 'Laughter and the  Law`,  today`s
anthologies  are  more direct and vicious, sporting  titles  like
"Lawyers as reptiles." Jokes tell us a lot about how a  society
thinks.  But, not all jokes reflect public opinion. Jokes  are  a
powerful  weapon to embarrass, oppress and type-cast  people  and
communities. If they occasion humour, they also defame; and,  may
damage  the  psyche of those at the receiving  end.  Jokes  about
lawyers  are  typically about their ruthlessness, their  lack  of
scruples in inventing arguments for whoever is willing to  reward
lawyers, their money mindedness. Lawyers are supposed to have  no
qualms  about running with the hares and hunting with the  hounds
with equal aplomb. And, the jokes tell it all.

Despite this reputation, people resort to lawyers. Perhaps,  they
have  no  other  choice but to turn to the  most  'artful`  in  a
society  in  which disputes abound and the rule  of  law  suffers
injury  from constant attack. Some interesting questions come  to
the fore in the recent exchange between Mr. Anil Diwan who is the
Supreme Court`s amicus in the Hawala case and Mr. Ram  Jethmalani
who  was  involved in the public interest case which led  to  the
Supreme Court`s investigation and subsequent orders; but who  now
appears  for  one  of  the accused, Mr.  L.  K.  Advani,  who  is
allegedly  a friend and political ally. Since  both  involvements
were  pro bono (without any payment), the issues are not  clouded
with  any accusation that any appearance was for  personal  gain.
The  argument is over the application of professional  norms  (if
any) to public interest law (PIL) counsel. The narrower issue  as
to  whether  it is proper for Mr. Jethmalani to  appear  for  Mr.
Advani  leads to questions about wider issues  concerning  public
interest  lawyers, PIL and the judicial activism that  has  grown
out  of it. Is PIL a public trust or a matter for the  individual
perception of the PIL lawyers involved?

PIL is a powerful instrument of accountability but it must not be
abused  as  it  has  been  in  many  cases.  Mr.  Jethmalani   is
responsible  for assisting the courts on many  crucial  questions
about who may represent the public interest. Any doubt about  the
legitimate  use of PIL can only give the enterprise a  bad  name.
Controversy  abounds.  One strand of the controversy  is  whether
'libertarian`  lawyers  can  ever  appear  for  those  who   have
allegedly abused human rights. Several lawyers (including myself)
have  been criticised for doing so even where it has been  argued
that  there  were public interest reasons for appearance  on  the
other  side.  This new controversy goes further, it  involves  an
allegation  of  'floor  crossing` in the same  batch  of  related
issues. It is particularly important because of the status of the
counsel and because it is not muddied by financial considerations
but  it is about the scope of the public interest insofar  as  it
concerns PIL lawyers.

The  exchange  between Mr. Anil Diwan and Mr.  Jethmalani  is  as
embarrassing  as it is troubling. Why should two  senior  counsel
quarrel  in  public  over  this  issue?  Discounting  personality
clashes  and differences, the issue needs examination. The  facts
seem  to  be  documented in an exchange of  letters  between  the
protagonists  which  have been made public. In  response  to  Mr.
Jethmalani  having declared that he will appear for  Mr.  Advani,
Mr. Diwan issued a press statement on September 22, 1996 (the day
the proceedings were to start) with "extreme reluctance and only
from a sense of public duty," expressing his discomfiture  which
relates back to March 26, 1996 when he had earlier written to Mr.
Jethmalani  expressing  'alarm` and 'distress` about  the  latter
appearing  for  Mr.  Advani.  It  transpires  that  it  was   Mr.
Jethmalani  who had involved Mr. Diwan in this case. There is  no
dispute about Mr. Jethmalani`s involvement with the PIL case that
led to the Hawala proceedings. In fact, in his letter of April 3,
1996,  Mr. Jethmalani forthrightly states: "I am quite clear  in
my mind that I am the architect of the petition, the moving force
behind  it  and  a  constant  participant  and  advisor  in   the
deliberations." So the issue was not whether he was involved  in
the  PIL  case but whether having been involved he  was  free  to
appear  for one of the accused. After explaining why  the  charge
against  Mr. Advani is totally untenable, in the same letter  Mr.
Jethmalani makes it clear that he has "no intention of appearing
for accused other than Mr. Advani."

Mr.   Jethmalani  justified  his  stance  by  referring  to   the
Advocates` Conduct Rules (which he claims to have drafted)  which
make  a  lawyer bound to accept any brief (except  under  special
circumstances, see R. 11) and to argue fearlessly by all fair and
honourable  means  (R.  15) as long as he  does  not  breach  the
confidence  of the client (R. 17 and 24). But, who is the  client
in the PIL case? Are PIL lawyers their own clients even when they
appear  for others? Mr. Jethmalani`s April 3, 1996 letter  became
redundant  because his junior wrote to Mr. Diwan on April 9  that
Mr. Jethmalani would not appear for Mr. Advani. Mr. Diwan replied
by drawing attention to another rule (R. 33) that anyone who  has
advised  or drawn pleadings for one side shall not plead for  the
opposite  party, pointing out that Mr. Advani`s name  appears  in
the PIL petitioners` pleadings. Equally, having used the  diaries
as a leverage, could any PIL lawyer cross over to the other  side
and  question any part of the case on which the PIL  petition  is
founded?  The  fact  that PIL cases  are  non-adversarial  cannot
foreclose  the  issue. Those affected by the PIL  and  are  being
brought  to book are on the other side. Anyhow, the death of  the
controversy  in April did not prevent a September  revival,  with
Mr.  Jethmalani  informing Mr. Diwan by letter on  September  17,
1996  that he was appearing for Mr. Advani and Mr.  Diwan  making
his press release. Mr. Jethmalani had fairly told Mr. Diwan  that
he  hoped  that Mr. Diwan would not create  controversy  but  Mr.
Jethmalani would understand if he did.

This  controversy is important because the distinguished  counsel
did  what  they did for clear reasons which  are  documented.  It
affects  cause  lawyering in India and may set patterns  for  the
future.  Mr. Jethmalani`s stance appears to be that  the  purpose
behind  the Hawala PIL case was to expose corruption and nab  the
guilty  and  not  oppress  the  innocent;  and  that  it  is  not
inconsistent with the public interest but fulfils its purposes to
defend Mr. Advani against whom there is no case in law. But, if a
personally judgmental stance of this nature were to be  accepted,
every PIL lawyer would be free to make exceptions, jump the fence
and  defend  whom  they like. This is not  to  suggest  that  PIL
lawyers  should not be discerning about whom they  are  attacking
and exposing. Indeed, it is their public duty to ensure that  the
PIL case does not result in a miscarriage of justice. But, once a
PIL case starts, it is for the Court to determine who is innocent
and who is guilty.

However  great  a criminal lawyer a person may be,  a  prosecutor
cannot cross over and be defence counsel even though it is always
open to the prosecution to submit that there is no case against a
particular  accused. Such withdrawal can only take  place  within
the discipline of the law. PIL lawyers are no differently  placed
than prosecution counsel. In environment cases, PIL lawyers often
distinguish between real and wrongly accused defaulters. As  long
as  this  is  honestly  done to  the  Court  concerned,  this  is
unexceptional.  But, these are the farthest limits to which  they
can go. But, just because they feel that one of the persons  they
are  proceeding against is innocent, they cannot appear in  mind,
spirit or fact for the allegedly innocent either in that case  or
any  other  related  proceeding. If this rule  of  thumb  is  not
respected,  lesser  professionals would, even with  the  best  of
intents, run with the hares and hunt with the hounds.

What  complicates  the  present  imbroglio  is  Mr.  Jethmalani`s
closeness  with the BJP, his appointment as Law Minister  in  the
ill-fated  BJP  Ministry, his ire  against  particular  political
parties  and  persons and his frankly declared  political  views.
This  must,  perforce, leave behind the impression  that  a  very
important  PIL case was not without political undertones even  if
it  was conceived in the public interest. This would  affect  the
enterprise of PIL as a whole. Properly interpreted the rules  are
reasonably  clear  cut. Involvement in a case (albeit  by  giving
advice or settling legal documents) is enough to prevent  lawyers
from  appearing for anyone in that or in any related  case  where
there may be a potential conflict of interest. This rule must  be
applied  in  an all or nothing fashion; and,  with  even  greater
rigour in PIL cases where the public is the client.

Jokes  about lawyers underline public suspicion about how  artful
lawyers  can be. But, before the jokes take their  toll,  lawyers
must  consciously  project  the  counter  image  that  they   are
mediators  of accountability and not for political, financial  or
any other kind of hire in PIL cases. Even the best of  intentions
may produce the worst of results. Nothing should be permitted  to
undermine  faith in the law at a time of moral cholera.  If  this
means clearer rules about cause lawyering, so be it. All the more
so,  because two senior counsel and 'eminent jurists` seem to  be
unsure about the rules and the right course of action.

Attitude of our athletes has to change: Amritraj

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. a

MADRAS, Sept. 27.

Vijay Amritraj sees India's poor record in the world of sport  as
a puzzle. And he quietly sets about putting the pieces together.
"All  the  pieces are there," he says, with a  smile  quite  as
radiant  as a child would flash after putting together its  first
plastic alphabet puzzle.

"It's  the attitude," says Vijay, raising his voice  just  that
bit  for theatrical effect as he picks up the last piece  of  the
puzzle.  "The attitude of our athletes has to change. They  seem
to  settle  for less, they seem to be contented with  less,"  he
says.

It  is  another  one  of  the  globe-trotting  former  Davis  Cup
captain's    meet-the-media    mornings   and    the    celebrity
player-turned-commentator is talking about why India should be so
backward in the world of sport.

"If  you look at the kind of money that has gone into  the  game
(tennis) in the last five years and then look at the results,  it
doesn't  match  up.  We  really have  to  demand  more  from  our
athletes," says Vijay.

He  is  tremendously impressed by Leander  Paes's  bronze-winning
effort  at Atlanta but feels that it is not enough in the  larger
context of Indian sport.

"Why settle for one bronze. I think if we make a serious effort,
if  we  shortlist 10 or 15 sports where we are fairly  good,  and
then  bring in sponsorship and scientific training, there  is  no
reason  why  we should not win at least five golds  in  the  2004
Olympics," he says.

"From  a  very  young age you have to aim for  the  sky,"  says
Vijay,  who was recently elected to the Board of the Tennis  Hall
of Fame at Newport, Rhode Island.

Quickly  the  conversation  veers towards his  pet  project,  the
Britannia  Amritraj  Trust programme. And Vijay says  that  "BAT
cannot always be the answer. It is only an example, a  yardstick.
Others have to follow."

He  is happy that BAT has moved to its own facility at  Mogappiar
on the outskirts of the city. "We'll continue to put in our  bit
but  you can never teach anyone to win. If you ask what  does  it
take to win, the answer is, there is no answer. Some do it better
than the others," he says.

In his time, he did it better than any other Indian of his era.

Film Review: "Subhash"

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 26, Col. e

It  has now become a standard theme for the heroine to  wish  the
hero  to  be a national personality to ask for her hand  and  the
latter  doing  so  in a trice on  the  screen.  Sivasri  Pictures
"Subhash"  is no exception and with that format is included  an
interesting  twist  in  the form of the brother of  the  hero,  a
minister,  being hand in glove with anti-national elements  which
puts the hero in a dilemma to arrive at a decision.

Director  R.  V. Udayakumar, who has displayed  his  flourish  in
dealing with love themes set in rural areas, ventures into  areas
of  action.  His handling suffers to some extent in  the  opening
portion  the  Indian  army  men  are  at  the  receiving  end  in
containing  the infiltrators on the border, only  Col.  Subhash's
line  of  communication being `active'. The viewer is  given  the
impression  that  the  other two wings of the  Indian  team  have
failed  to  stop the aliens. But actually one sees  some  half-a-
dozen  automatic  weapons  carrying  thug  like  persons  running
helter-skelter  in the forest; the hero, with a pistol  on  hand,
goes  bang bang. Then a commander at the  headquarters  announces
`Thank  God, the country has been saved (by Subhash), the  entire
segment  of the dialogue here being mostly in English.  What  had
happened  to  the  other two wings of the Indian  forces  is  not
known.  This  sloppy work of the director is compensated  by  the
good  camera  work of Shiva and the director comes into  his  own
when he moves into the drama of hearts.

As usual it is the timid Shastri girl Savithri (Revathi) for whom
the  hero  Subhash (Arjun) falls in love though he has  a  svelte
shapely  lass Anitha (Monica Bedi) almost begging for  his  love.
Subhash's father (Jai Shankar) is a rich influential lawyer while
his  first  son Rajasekhar (Siddique) is  a  respected  minister.
Rajasekhar  and  his wife (Sudha) treat the hero like  their  own
son. The wooing of Savithri by Subhash gives rise to some  tender
moments  nicely  handled  by  the  director,  particularly   when
Savithri  says she does not love him and asking him to stay  away
from  her,  all told in gentle manner. The timid  nature  of  the
character  is  adequately brought out by Revathi with  her  voice
modulation. She further catches the attention in the scene  where
she  firmly  states that she wants a life partner  who  had  done
something  for the country, making the hero join the  army.  Then
Revathi  is sidelined till the end when the minister's  moves  to
safeguard  his position occupy the frames. Manivannan, the  party
worker with ulterior motives and with a cheeky tongue, cashes  in
on  the  opportunities  in  the  toppling  game  played   between
Rajasekhar  and  his  arch  rival in  politics  but  best  friend
Arumugamy  (Prakashraj). Siddique and Prakashraj are made  up  on
the  same lines and one has to make sure who is going to die  and
who  isn't. Siddique plays the cool customer villain  with  quiet
efficiency.

Arjun shows remarkable agility in the action segments,  indulging
in  clashes  atop  a moving goods train in a  ghat  section,  the
camera  of Shiva again doing the trick and the stunt men  of  the
Subbarayan team essaying the action with vigour. In the  face-to-
face  meeting with his brother on the train Arjun is quite up  to
the task. Monica Bedi is at ease in the romance areas  performing
the dances with elan. (Arjun has rendered a song with Sujatha  in
"Chutti  Ponnu" and all the lyrics for the six songs have  been
written by the director). The other two reasonably good tunes  of
Vidyasagar  are  "Thendral vanthu" (SPB  and  Chitra),  "Mugam
enna" (SPB and Swarnalatha).

The Vadivelu-Vivek comedy is nothing much to enthuse about  while
adequate support is extended by Jai Shankar, Y. Vijaya, Sudha, K.
R.  Vatchala,  Prakashraj,  Hemanth  (the  bogus  swamiyar)   and
Prasanna.

`Mission: Impossible'

Watching  director  Brian de Palma's creations  is  like  piecing
together  a giant jig-jaw puzzle. The way he unfolds  the  drama,
the  close-up, tight editing and the depiction of  incidents  all
make  the  viewer's grey matter work overtime. And if  the  theme
happens to be connected with undercover agents as in  Paramount's
"Mission: Impossible" then the intrigue and suspense will  grip
the viewer till the last.

The  theme  about  double agents is not new  but  the  director's
inimitable  style  of  narration  makes  every  twist  and   turn
engrossing.  Ethan  Hunt's  (Tom Cruise) entire  team  headed  by
veteran  Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is killed while on a top  secret
mission  to retrieves a list of CIA agents stolen by the bad  man
Golitsyn.  Now Golitsyn wants to steal another list of  the  real
names  of  the agents. The top brass suspects Etham, who  is  the
sole  survivor and he is suspended. The escape of Ethan from  the
posh  aquarium-cum-restaurant  where  he  meets  the  CIA  chief,
Kittridge  (Henry Czerny) is an interesting scene. Ethan goes  to
Jim's  place  to learn the identity of the culprit  and  that  is
where he gets the first clue - "Job: 14," a code connected with
the  Bible - and learns about the dealer Max (Venessa  Redgrave),
an old woman with deadly connections. He makes a deal with her to
get  the identity of the seller of the first list by offering  to
get the second list.

For  this piece of operation, he gets the help of  Krieger  (Jean
Reno)  and Luther (Ving Rhames) and breaks into a  high  security
chamber  of  the  headquarters.  The  trio  escape  the  security
measures  by  entering the chamber  through  the  air-conditioned
duct.

With  the  information  in hand, Ethan  prepares  for  the  final
meeting with Max when a "dead" Phelps makes his appearance. The
unbelievable  happenings atop the fast moving train offer  a  new
experience to the viewers.

Top  Cruise is a co-partner of the movie shot by Stephen H.  Brum
with the special visual effects provided by Industrial Light  and
Music.

India-Film: Humane, down to earth: Vijayalakshmi

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 26, Col. d

Right  from her childhood, she had the burning desire to  act  in
films.  Born into an indigent agriculturist's family of Eluru  in
Andhra  Pradesh  Vijayalakshmi knocked at the  doors  of  several
producers  before she bagged a couple of roles in Malayalam.  Her
persistence  paid  off  when  she  was  cast  in  a  Tamil  film,
"Vandichakram" directed by K. Vijayan. Overnight  Vijayalakshmi
became a star with a new name `Silk' Smitha.

There  was no looking back for Smitha after  "Vandichakram".  A
dance number by her became mandatory in almost all Tamil films. A
song  with Kamal Hassan in AVM's "Sagalakalavalavan"  became  a
big  hit and boosted her popularity immensely. She acted  as  the
heroine in four films - "Silk Silk Silk" and "Police  Police"
in Tamil and "Veeravikram" and "Premachesudu" in Telugu. When
she was riding the crest of a success wave, two films produced by
her bombed at the box office.

A  frustrated Smitha quit acting in films for two years. She  re-
entered the film industry through Maniratnam's "Geetanjali".
Smitha   was  a  humane  person.  Every  year,  on  Pongal,   she
distributed free clothes to the poor. Her views on marriage  were
firm.  She once said that no one would be interested in  marrying
her. "He may ask me why I wear this dress and that. As far as  I
am  concerned, marriage is not for me. So I am not interested  in
it."  Her biggest regret in life was the film she produced.  "I
did  the biggest blunder in my life by producing films. I do  not
know  anything about production. But I produced three  films  and
lost what I had earned through acting."

India-Music: A mesmeric touch: Sanjay Subramaniam

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 27, Col. a

SVK  on  a  concert where there was enough  musical  material  to
tickle the admiration of listeners.

In  the  concert  by Sanjay  Subramaniam  for  the  Maharajapuram
Viswanatha Iyer Trust, the joy he created in the alapana and song
was  a palpable entity. His imagination was not vitiated  by  the
usual intellectual mechanism. Massive in manodharma, energetic in
exposition, sumptuous in sensitivity and replete with  refinement
his  Bhairavi raga alapana brimmed with  fascinating  sentiments.
The  values  he  cherished  in  elaborating  the  raga  made  his
presentation  first class. He gave primacy to raga swaroopa  even
while  sticking to present day cutcheri formulations.  There  was
enough  musical  material  in  it to  tickle  the  admiration  of
listeners.  The  characteristic feature of his technique  is  his
lesser  desire  to please the rasikas by the voice  than  by  the
grandeur of the raga structure.

Sanjay  Subramaniam believes in an assertive salesmanship of  his
musical  wares.  In the very first song `Vallabha  Nayakasya'  in
Begada, the pace and punch were overpowering. He gave a  mesmeric
touch  to  this  song  and the  others  `Kartigeya'  (Thodi)  Oh!
Rajeevaksha  (Aarabhi) and "Upacharamulanu"  (Bhairavi).  There
was ostentation and pomp in the way he rendered the kirtanas, but
refinement in approach made for their instant appeal. The Aarabhi
raga  alapana glistened with elegant sancharas. While  diligently
eschewing  obesity in vinyasa, the delineation looked  aggressive
with  the janta sancharas, a distinguishing label, gaining  great
prominence  at  his hands. The Bhairavi  coming  immediately  was
couched  in  salubrious  tenderness. Perhaps  the  very  mood  of
Bhairavi  induced  him to soften his voice  particularly  in  the
sthayi  range  when he emphasised the beauteous light  and  shade
manoeuvres. Sriram Kumar on the violin had not much difficulty in
framing the alapana lines of Aarabhi and Bhairavi because  Sanjay
earlier had laid the highway well and truly. The movement of  the
sancharas  was smooth and the low modulation made  his  rendering
soft  and  flexible. Arun Prakash as  the  mridangam  accompanist
contributed to firmness of percussive support without sacrificing
the gentleness of laya's place in a concert.

In the 5 O'Clock session Sasikaran presented his musical training
through  emphasis  on  songs. If Sanjay sought  to  win  audience
appreciation  through Begada, Aarabhi and Bhairavi (all  familiar
ragas)  Sasikaran  somehow seemed to place his  faith  on  Chaya,
Tarangini,   Kannadagowla,  Bhoopalam  and   Chandrajyoti   often
provoking  some members of the audience to ask the vocalist  what
raga  it was. A cutcheri built on such a selection  could  hardly
enthuse the rasikas. Towards the end came Madhyamavati (`Palinchu
Kamakshi')  while  his  presentation of the raga  picture  was  a
scale-model.  B. Gayatri, violinist, played with such  depth  and
delicacy that one could easily differentiate the approach of  the
vocalist  and  the  appeal of the violinist. It  was  a  luminous
Madhyamavati   that  Gayatri  presented,  luxurious   in   loving
sancharas. There was enough expressional maturity in her handling
of  the  raga. Sasikaran sang "Sri Maha Ganapathe"  (Abhogi,  a
composition  of N. S. Ramachandran) "Kripa joo chutaku"  (Chaya
Tarangini)   `Orajoopuchu'  (Kannada  Gowla)   `Sadaachaleswaram'
(Bhoopalam)  and "Bhagyanayya" (Chandrajyoti).  Familiar  ragas
and songs are the surest and easiest way to woo rasika attention.
J.  Balaji  was  the mridangam accompanist who  nursed  his  role
competently.

Being brought up in an atmosphere of excellent musical  tradition
gives a head start to a young aspirant like Master Ramprasad, the
grandson of Palghat Mani Iyer. Striving to live up to the demands
of  such a tradition requires not merely well-learnt songs,  raga
alapana techniques and swaraprasthara methods. These are  aspects
of  music  that  many youngsters in the  field  today  are  quite
conversant with and climb the dais with confidence. But only when
the  most  elusive  feature of refinement  in  interpretation  is
achieved,  the advantages of an ennobling traditional  atmosphere
can  be  said  to have conferred noteworthy  excellence.  In  the
absence of such refinement, music becomes formula-ridden.
Singing  for  Raga  Tarangini  the  performing  style  of  Master
Ramprasad gave rise to these thoughts. He has memorised the songs
well  and presenting them to the audience with competence he  put
his claim to due recognition on that score. He seems to feel that
a  stepped-up  kalapramana  to  songs  contributes  to   cutcheri
liveliness.  In  that attempt, in singing fast  sangatis  or  the
second kala swaras he bit more than he could chew. Each  avartana
of  the  second  kala swara to the  songs  "Chani  Todi  Theve"
(Harikambhoji)  "Tulasidala" (Mayamalavagowla)  and  "Ennaganu
Rama  Bhajana" (Pantuvarali) was a race to the  starting  point.
The  same  haste  was  to be noticed  in  the  mel  kala  neraval
passages.  Nowadays  cutcheries  centre mainly  round  these  two
segments  of swara and raga speeds. Ramprasad too seems  to  have
fallen  into  this trap. With many years before him he  would  do
well  to gradually understand that visranti is the atman of  good
music. Pantuvarali raga lines were okay, but the Mukhari  alapana
attempt  was not so satisfying. Mukhari and Begada are two  ragas
whose  scales  alone do not bring out their beauty.  One  has  to
sense  a  feel  of the ragas. "Emani Ne"  was  the  kirtana  in
Mukhari.  T.  R. Rajamani kept his role of a  violin  accompanist
well  both  in raga alapanas, neraval and swaras.  Ganapathi  Ram
playing  on  the mridangam gave lustrous  support  through  well-
nourished korvais and cross-beats to embellish the songs.

India-Music: Marked by refinement: Neyveli R. Santhanagopalan

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 27, Col. a

With  his  artistic  talents  directed  strenuously  towards   an
intuitive  search for and interpretation of the features  of  the
classical  music of the South in a state of old time  excellence,
Neyveli  R. Santhanagopalan succeeded in sustaining the  interest
of  an appreciative audience. Featured by Tambaram Music Club  at
Sita Devi Garodia Hindu Vidyalaya Higher Secondary School in East
Tambaram,  his vocal recital gave much satisfaction to lovers  of
serious music.

The  vocalist's  involvement  in conveying the  contents  of  his
recital  in a reasonably refined style was discernible  right  in
his  faithful  execution  of  the  opening  piece,  the   varnam,
`Viriboni'  in Bhairavi set to ata tala. His exposition  of  this
monumental  varnam  with concentration on the projection  of  its
classical  strength  evoked keen listening. Though  he  chose  to
render  the first line of his extempore swaras for this piece  in
the  slow  tempo with an earnestness to extend  the  raga's  mood
refreshingly  and forcefully, the instinct to engage  himself  in
exciting progression of swaras in the accelerated middle pace had
a sway and made him spurn the slow pace instantly.

Santhanagopalan's  rendition  of the piece,  "Girirajasuta"  of
Tyagaraja  in  Bangala was adequately reflective  of  the  song's
scintillating  musical  setting in a happy mood.  The  piece  was
suffixed  interestingly with a set of colourful swara texts.  The
vocalist's  outline of Panthuvarali had a smart course  with  its
familiar phrases touched upon with a commendable insight into its
swarupa.  The  piece that succeeded it  was  `Aparamabhakthi'  of
Tyagaraja  extended elegantly to an engaging session  of  neraval
and swaras for `Lakshmidevi' etc.

Following  an attractive representation of Marukela of  Tyagaraja
in  Jayanthasri,  Santhanagopalan  presented  a  fairly  detailed
description  of Bilahari with a clear perception of its  Carnatic
identity. The piece, `Sri Chamundeswari' in it came in a pleasing
diction.

Tiruparkadal  S. Veeraraghavan's accompaniment on the violin  was
comfortable. His profile of Bilahari had an enjoyable traditional
flavour.

T.  K.  Murthy offered lively rhythmic support on  the  mridangam
with  powerful  percussion  patterns.  Srirangam  Kannan   played
gleefully on the morsing.

The  veena  recital of Prabhavathi Ganesan featured  by  Tirumala
Tirupati Devasthanams Information Centre at its auditorium in  T.
Nagar on the day of the birth star of Lord Venkateswara formed  a
delightful  display  on  her  accomplishment  as  a  sufficiently
sensitive artiste.

Opening  her  recital with a  tasteful execution of  the  varnam,
`Vanajakshi' (Kalyani, adi tala), she played `Vallabha Nayakasya'
of  Muthuswamy  Dikshitar  in Begada with a zest  to  expose  its
moving  musical  contents through hearty gamakas.  The  artiste's
recital of the piece, `Orajupu' (Kannadagowlai) of Tyagaraja came
in a mellow style of veena artistry.

Her sketch of Panthuvarali was tentative and it was followed by a
convincing  diction of `Aparamabhakthi.' The piece was  completed
with a tidy session of neraval and swaras.

Following an enjoyable exposition of `Kshirasagara' of  Tyagaraja
in  Devagandhari,  the artiste rendered `Manavyala' of  the  same
composer in Nalinakanthi in an agile instrumental version. It was
in  her  detailed delineation of Karaharapriya  that  Prabhavathi
Ganesan revealed the strong foundation laid for her artistry in a
rigorous  school.  The  essential  features  of  this  raga  were
communicated by her in an immensely satisfying emotive mode.  Her
diction of the piece, `Pakkala' (Tyagaraja) in it was neat.
Nanganallur  Sriram  (mridangam)  and  Rajesh  (ghatam)  provided
affable percussion support.

India-Art: Based on Nature: T. C. A. Gopalakrishnan

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 27, Col. c

T.  C. A. Gopalakrishnan was a member of the Madras Art Club  and
learnt painting from artists who were also in the faculty of  the
College  of Arts and Crafts, Madras.

Even  though the Club is no longer functioning he continues  with
his  hobby  in a very keen manner.

All his themes are based on nature and the paintings such as  the
"Serene forest" and "The glowing forest" evoked cool and calm
feelings in the viewer.

Even   when  expressing  abstract  emotions  like   "Suspicion"
Gopalakrishnan   uses  birds  and  animals  to  illustrate   such
feelings.

In all the water colour paintings exhibited recently at the Lalit
Kala  Akademi,  he uses the same style of filling the  area  with
thin  lines of colour using 0 or 00 brushes instead of  giving  a
wash;  of course in the pen and ink drawings - some of  his  were
also  shown  -  this  is a  practice  adopted  by  many  artists.
Gopalakrishnan admitted to using the same technique in oils  too.
His works are pleasing and decorative:

He  has participated in many National exhibitions, and the  shows
of Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, Hyderabad Art Society,  Bharat
Kala  Parishad, Hyderabad in which he was  "Highly  commended,"
All India Prints Exhibition, etc.

He  also participated in a camp organised by the Tamil Nadu  Ovia
Nunkalai Kuzhu and his work can be found in the Madras Museum and
private collections.

Dance: Confident display

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 28, Col. d

Sri   Parthasarathy  Swami  Sabha,  the  96  year  old   cultural
institution conducted a dance series recently, featuring artistes
from different schools.

S.  Meera, disciple of S. K. Kameswaran and Saroja, performed  on
one of the evenings, marking her out as a sincere follower of the
Vazhuvoor  tradition. Guru S. K. Kameswaran, gave  vocal  support
for  the  recital  which was conducted by  Mahalakshmi  who  ably
handled the nattuvangam.

Meera  has  a  charming personality  and  very  expressive  eyes.
Technically she scored fairly in the Jatiswaram (Kalyani) and  in
the    following   varnam,   "Naadanai   Azhaithu    Vaa"    of
Tiruveezhimizhalai  Sri  Nataraja Sundaram  Pillai.  The  typical
theermanams  of Vazhuvoor school were fulfilled skilfully by  the
dancer.  But her abhinaya one hopes, will improve with  time  and
experience.

Also  there  seemed  a wrong notion  in  her  presentation  that,
throughout  the recital a dancer should keep a pleasant face  and
that  too  with  a full smile always  flashing  the  teeth.  This
appeared  totally  unrelishable, especially when the  dancer  was
emoting  for the lines - "Vedanai Tuyarile" -  meaning  "while
experiencing  the pangs of agony".

A calm face would bring the necessary dignity. The ideas of Bhava
abhinaya,  without  dramatisation or overdramatisation,  and  the
feeling  of sensitive element of divine approach to this  section
of  Bharatanatyam  seem  to  have lost  their  values  when  such
presentations are witnessed.

Earlier  in  "Brochevarevarura"  (Khamas)  scenes  of  Gajendra
Moksha  was  overdramatised. Subtlety is the keynote  to  achieve
skill in abhinaya.

Meera,  on the whole, appeared composed and confident  throughout
the performance.

Neat job by veteran director: "Nerukku Ner"

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 29, Col. a

Seething  with the memories of humiliations and grievances,  they
shun each other, one man's name spelling anathema to the other.
In  `Nerukku Ner', the ultimate confrontation is not between  the
usual duo - friends whose goodwill has soured or brothers who are
deadly enemies. The clash is between an elderly father-in-law and
his  only middle-aged son-in-law. Nursing a deeply felt sense  of
wrong  done, and allowing emotional wounds to fester, they  avoid
each other's company. Until compelled by circumstances and  their
own impulses to forget and forgive, to bridge the gulf.
One  of the few quality plays to be witnessed recently  "Nerukku
Ner"s strength was the completely natural way in which the story
and  theme was dealt with. Writer K. S. N. Sundar showed  a  good
grasp of human psychology and built up the drama in neat, logical
steps.  Veteran  director K. S. Nagarajan had done  a  fine  job,
handling  the  story  in a crisp, capable  fashion  not  allowing
himself  to  be sidetracked into irksome comedy or  padding.  The
result was wholesome fare that captured the essence of the milieu
it was set in - the Brahmin middle-class - without distortion  or
caricature.

Even  after a quarter century has passed, Raghavachary (K. S.  N.
Sundar)  rages  at the insults heaped on him  by  his  son-in-law
Varadarajan  (V.  Chandru)  years  ago. When  his  only  son  and
daughter-in-law perished in an accident, Raghavachary had  sought
refuge for his year old orphaned grandson, in Varadarajan's home.
The   son-in-law  ordered  him  out  as  he   held   Raghavachary
responsible  for his mother's heartbreak and  death.  Varadarajan
also forbids his wife Vaidehi from having anything to do with her
father.

Determined  to cope on his own, Raghavachary, a widower,  manages
to bring up his grandson. At 25, Madhavan (Akshay Kumar) is now a
smart  executive  and the apple of his  grandfather's  eye.  When
Vaidehi  (S. P. Srimathi) seeks to get her daughter  Mala  (Indu)
married  to  Madhavan  using her son Mukundan (G.  Arun)  as  go-
between,  Raghavachary opposes the match tooth and nail. So  does
Varadarajan.

After  attempts to fix up matches elsewhere for the girl  by  her
father fizzle out, the two antagonists finally meet. And sundered
ties are mended and harmony is restored in the family.

The  play owed its vitality to the excellent acting by  the  lead
artistes.  Sundar was matched in word and gesture by Chandru  and
together they kept the two decade enmity at full steam.  Srimathi
as  the  one who feels unhappy and frustrated  by  the  obstinate
attitude of husband and father, put in a convincing  performance,
her  face  reflecting  her anxiety well.  Her  nine-yard  costume
wrapped around her Egyptian mummy-like struck the only artificial
note  in the drama. Indu, the obedient daughter and Arun  as  her
rational  elder brother filled the bill. Akshay Kumar,  the  duty
conscious, affectionate grandson is the same in every play -  not
for  him  the  nuances of a character  or  slight  variations  in
portrayal.  Ramji who played the portly officer who does his  bit
in aiding the reconciliation, was adequate.

A  delightful portrayal was put in by V. Ramani as  Rangudu,  the
little-educated next door youth who makes it big in the political
scene.  His astute questions (on economic liberalisation,  hawala
deals  and benami) and answers were pertinent statements  on  the
contemporary  scene,  and  also  lightened  the  atmosphere.  The
success of the characterisation was largely due to the casual and
natural delivery of the lines by Ramani who made the absurd sound
plausible.

The  play  sagged in the middle with the `I hate him'  and  `Mala
must marry Madhu' incantation becoming tiresome; a little editing
would help.

The  manner in which the foes make up in the end, each  eager  to
apologise to the other and take on the blame was true to life.
Sadly,  for  a  good effort there were hardly 25  people  in  the
Mylapore  Fine Arts Club auditorium where Kala Nilayam  presented
the drama under the auspices of Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.

World record break by Russell: Causier pips Gilchrist at the post

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. a

By G. Viswanath

MUMBAI, Sept. 26.

Fifty-eight seconds ...59... seconds and bang. The finishing  and
triumphant  stroke  was rammed in by David Causier  in  the  last
second. It was sudden death for 1994 World professional champion,
England's Peter Gilchrist. It was akin to a last ball finish in a
cricket match.

The  cue  ball  (white) was close at hand  and  the  object  ball
(yellow) perched at the mouth of the top right hand pocket begged
to be sunk in. But the clock could have beaten the young Causier.
The  18-year-old literally counted the closing seconds  with  his
eyes  on the neon clock lights ticking away as fast as his  heart
beat.

"The white (Causier's cue ball) stopped at 1 hr 58 seconds and I
hit  it," said Causier who, after playing the finishing  stroke,
marched towards Gilchrist in a jiffy with an extended right hand.
Gilchrist  could not believe he had lost the  quarterfinals,  but
the  cruel reality was that he was beaten by a quirk of  fate  in
the Gold Flake World professional billiards championship here  on
Thursday.

Sethi to meet Shandilya

Top-notcher Mike Russell embellished his comfortable 2391-821 win
over  Devendra  Joshi with a world record break of  753  compiled
under  the  baulkline rule. Russell will take on Causier  in  the
semifinal on Friday. Three-time champion Geet Sethi shrugged  off
his first session diffidence to get past Chris Shutt in the  last
of  the  quarterfinals.  Sethi  plays  Shandilya  in  the  second
semifinal.

The man to mark is Russell who was the first cueist to break  the
500-barrier in the championship. He smashed a 676 against  Mukesh
Rehani  in  the first round. Russell's skill was evident  in  the
first  session  when he carved out three century  breaks  in  the
first  session, including the 291 on his 27th visit.  He  started
the second with a 148 and then firmly placed himself on top table
to amass 753 in less than three quarters of an hour. The previous
best was his 713 against Sethi in the British Open. It was a one-
sided affair all the way with Joshi making two century breaks  of
133 and 120.

Sethi,  playing on the disputed table with a coarse  cloth,  came
into  his  own in the second session. Down by 39  points  at  the
interval,  Sethi carved out two big breaks of 183 and 190 to  eke
out a win by 331 points.

Last  year in the qualifier at Leeds, Causier was beaten  by  the
clock and Gilchrist scraped through by four points. A year  later
the story was reversed in a classic quarterfinal match watched by
a capacity crowd.

In  another quarterfinal, Ashok Shandilya, trailing  behind  Alok
Kumar by 251 points after the first two-hour session, turned  the
heat on his opponent in the second session to win 1402-1178.
The  match between Causier and Gilchrist on Thursday never  threw
the  prospect of a humdinger. Causier, playing with a  free  mind
and  with  a  fixity of purpose, began with  a  197.  Three  more
century  breaks of 115, 164 and 109 put him ahead at 766-369  and
it  seemed Causier was determined to deal the knock-out punch  to
Gilchrist. But the 1995 world champion showed splendid resilience
with a masterly 244.

Gilchrist  was far from his best in the first 30 minutes  of  the
second  session,  but moved into top gear from  his  10th  visit.
Causier slammed a 193 and collected two more breaks of 86 and  92
to  lead by 269 points. Gilchrist hit back with a 210 to  whittle
down  the  lead and the match was really opening up.  There  were
exactly 6 minutes and 40 seconds left when Gilchrist came for his
last  visit and all he needed was 104 points. While Causier  kept
chewing away at his fingernails, Gilchrist moved on to top table.
Gilchrist  was focussed and he measured every shot. Referee  Ajay
Rastogi's baulkline warning at 80 reminded Gilchrist that he  had
after  all an encumbrance to meet before playing a shot  at  100.
His  hand ball crossed the baulkline on effecting a red  pot  and
the  immediate target was 104 which he met in seconds. The  crowd
applauded and Gilchrist thought he had already gone past 104.  He
looked  at the clock and wasted a few seconds. At exactly 1  hour
55  seconds he bent low to play a thin in-off on the object  ball
(white) with the red on spot. He missed contact.

Three  seconds left and Causier got the godsend  opportunity  for
survival in the championship. He rammed his cue in a split second
to sink the yellow. He got the crucial two points which made  all
the  difference  and helped him progress to the  semifinals.  The
verdict  was clear. "The beep went off after Causier struck  the
ball.  We saw it on the replay on the television monitor,"  said
an official. "I don't want to play another match like this...  I
feel  sorry for Peter, " trailed off Causier making the sign  of
the cross.

Alok  Kumar,  the  surprise packet of the  championship,  was  in
control in the first two-hour session. "I was hitting the  wrong
sides - the in-offs and canons - in the first session. I did  not
get  my rhythm. But in the second everything went right, "  said
Shandilya after his win. Shandilya recovered with breaks of  169,
76,  54, 96 and 85. But it was a 198 on his 12th visit which  put
him ahead of Alok Kumar for the first time in the match. And a 94
proved  to be the clincher. Alok Kumar made a 127 in  the  second
session, but nerves played on him in the last 30 minutes.
The  results: David Causier (Eng) 1432 (197, 115, 164, 109,  193)
bt  Peter  Gilchrist  (Eng)  1430 (110,  244,  210,  104);  Ashok
Shandilya  (Ind)  1402 (120, 169, 198) bt Alok Kumar  (Ind)  1178
(104, 102, 127); Geet Sethi (Ind) 1496 (126, 111, 183, 125,  190)
bt  Chris  Shutt 1165 (102, 204); Mike Russell (Eng)  2391  (117,
182, 291, 148, 753, 132) bt Devendra Joshi (Ind) 821 (133, 120).
Final to be telecast live

Doordarshan will telecast live the final slated for Saturday  at.
The telecast begins at 2-20 p.m. on the National network (DD  1),
according to a Doordarshan press release on Thursday.

Sleek and modern

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 29, Col. d

You may be a writer, a designer, an architect or an engineer. You
may  also  have a table to work on. But the moment  you  want  to
work,  you conveniently shift all your accessories to the  dining
table  where  spreading  everything  from  paper  and  pencil  to
reference items is easy. Lack of space prevents you from buying a
table as big as a dining table for your study. So the only option
available  is  a change in the work area,  and  unfortunately  it
happens quite too often.

It  is  for  such professionals that Nirja  Lath  of  Jaipur  has
designed  a special kind of utilitarian and space saving  writing
table. The table has all the small utility spaces and drawers  to
keep books, writing things, pins, papers, etc. The long table top
fixed  temporarily  to  the tall structure  can  be  pulled  down
whenever one needs large work area, and once the table comes down
one has plenty of space to spread sheets of paper, draw, write or
do whatever one wants to.

Many  in  Madras might have seen the space  saving  furniture  of
Nirja Lath at the Central Cottage Industries Emporium in  Madras.
Her  designs  are unconventional and very modern.  Naturally  her
target  customers are the modern day urban Indians whose life  is
extremely  fast  paced, who live in small houses but  would  like
keep  them  elegant,  neat and orderly.  None  of  the  furniture
designed  by her has any frills, ornamentation or  grandeur,  but
look dignified, in harmony with the present day world. There is a
quiet  smoothness in their lines, a rhythmic and fluent  flow  in
their curves and a clarity in their finish.

You might be involved in your work when your baby is crawling all
over the room and trying to overturn whatever she can cling onto.
At  least for a while, you can keep her amused with some toys  in
the chair designed by Nirja. There is a box like structure  which
can accommodate the chair inside in case of such emergencies. And
as  the child grows up, this structure can be turned sideways  so
that  it  becomes  the little one's eating  table,  or  even  her
drawing  and  studying  table. Of course  the  chair  which  once
trapped her can be hers to sit in front of the table. This is one
of the most innovative and attractive designs in the show.
A stylisitically created cot which is just a few inches high from
the  floor  looked  extremely restrained in its  lines,  and  can
provide  grace  to  a child's room. The  child  can  roll  around
without  the fear of getting hurt on falling down from  the  cot.
The back rest of the cot has adequate space where the mother  can
store  bed  sheets,  pillow covers,  etc.,  without  wasting  the
precious space inside an almirah.

The piece-de-resistance was the dressing table cum clothes  stand
cum  cupboard.  It  is said to be fastest moving  item  on  show.
Another  item which looks very simple and plain is a divan  whose
head  rest can be raised when you want to rest and enjoy a  movie
on the television, and later on it can be lowered to function  as
a cot also. A useful item for avid television watchers who prefer
the lying down position to the sitting position!

"We  haven't provided any fine work which can attract  dust,  so
cleaning  or dusting the furniture is not a big problem  for  the
urban  working  woman. Even though there is a  great  demand  for
ornamental  furniture these days, we saw a lot of interest  among
people  in  the  kind  of space  saving  furniture  that  we  are
offering," one of the organisers said.

An  exhibition of these stylish designer furniture  organised  by
Akar Prakar of Jaipur was on show at the Vimonisha Art gallery.

Lanka scores a convincing win

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. e

By S. R. Suryanarayan

DOHA, Sept. 26.

Sri  Lanka ended its campaign with a 3-0 win over Philippines  in
the  FIFA World Cup Asian Zone group 10 qualifying tournament  at
the Khalifa Stadium here tonight.

Roshan  Perera (two) and Chaminda Steinwell were the scorers  for
the Lankans who led 1-0 at the half-way stage.

The  Filipinos  also finished their engagement with  their  third
defeat.  The  new  comers  to the  World  Cup  qualifying  phase,
Filipinos had a nightmarish experience, conceding as many as  ten
goals in their three matches and not having scored any.
Tonight  the  team  had a chance or two  to  score,  but  clearly
finesse was missing when most needed.

Sri  Lanka now awaits India's match tomorrow to know  whether  it
will be placed second or third finally in the league table.  With
a win and a draw to its credit, the team has four points.
This  has  been  a tournament devoid  of  public  interest.  Even
matches involving Qatar did not attract fans. So today it was not
a surprise to see a near empty stadium for what essentially was a
match  of only academic interest.  Both the teams are out of  the
race.

The  interest if anything was only is seeing whether  Philippines
would be able to gain its first point or whether Sri Lanka  would
be  able  to pump in many goals, something that could  stand  the
island  nation in good stead in case there is a tie for a  second
place with India.

Expectedly,  the  Sri  Lankan attack looked  lot  more  incisive,
something  that was to energise the handful of Lankan  supporters
who were quick to begin their cheering efforts.

Roshan  Perera and Antony  Silva had Chaminda Stenwell  today  to
add  sharpness  to the Lankan offensive. The  Filipinos  held  on
precariously  with  goalkeeper  Edmundo looking  totally  out  of
sorts. He nearly messed up a straight forward collection of a try
by  Silva and conceded a flag kick. Silva took the kick from  far
side and Chaminda rifled his header perfectly to beat the crowded
defence for the Lankan breakthrough.

It  must be said that the Filipinos were not mere  spectators  in
this match. There were attempts to make combined moves,  inspired
by  Eduardo  from the middle. As usual Viliran and  Lobaton  shot
ahead showing good speed to cause concern in the Lankan  defence.
Viliran  once did essay a crisp waist-high shot, but straight  to
goalkeeper Lalith Weerasinghe.

But  what  almost undid the Lankan joy was the run by  the  rival
captain  Vincente in a flash counter attack. The  Lankan  defence
had  advanced  too far to check him. Seeing  the  danger,  Lalith
rushed out of the box to challenge Vincente. He succeeded even if
in  the process he conceded a free kick and also earned a  yellow
card for touching the ball outside the penalty area.

It was a lucky escape for Sri Lanka, nonetheless.

Play  became lot more pedestrian after the change of ends.  This,
despite the Filipinos success now in working a few positive moves
engineered by Vincente and Edurardo.

This  was  the  first occasion when the Filipinos  were  able  to
exhibit  a  bit  of their ball skills. But  the  enthusiasm  thus
worked  up  finally gave way to trouble at its own  end.  A  long
clearance  from  Dudley Steinwall saw Roshin rushing  ahead  with
none  really to challege him. A quick trapping and placement  saw
Roshan getting the second goal.

Another  phase of dullness followed before Sri Lanka  earned  the
gift of a spot kick when Talavera used his hands to stop a  Silva
try.  Roshan converted to help Sri Lanka record its best  win  in
this tournament.

It  was  yet  another day of  poor  refereeing.  The  Kazhakistan
official, Ordabaev, allowed several fouls to go unnoticed.

Unusual combinations

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 30, Col. d

Marien Mathew visits a restaurant where one can enjoy the food of
his choice  watching his favourite star in action.

Visualise  this.  It  is  the year  2000.  After  long  extensive
research,  scientists  have made a pathbreaking  discovery.  They
have  identified the genes that make Tamilians so susceptible  to
films.  Yes,  it  has  to be in the  genes.  There  is  no  other
explanation  for the incomparable effect the celluloid magic  has
on us.

Elsewhere  in  the  world  when  media  experts  talk  about  the
potential  of the visual medium we already have a list  of  Chief
Ministers to prove the point. Here in Tamil Nadu the stars,  ones
on the silver screen not the astral variety, have more  influence
on ordinary, mortal beings.

So how about celebrating it? Let us succumb to the spell of those
lavishly  mounted  glittering sets, where the  hero  and  heroine
prance  about  singing  songs,  a  practice  continued  from  the
pioneering days of S. S. Vassan and A. V. Meyyappa Chettiar.  The
Taramani  Talkies  is  all  about this.  The  restaurant  in  the
premises  of MGR film City takes care of your  entertainment  and
food.

The  ambience is unmistakable. You have to walk past  the  ticket
counter  or  reception to the multi-cuisine restaurant.  The  big
screen  showing  the  hero and the heroine  gyrating  to  a  song
dominated  the  room. Isn't this bliss, watching  your  favourite
actor/actress and enjoying the food of your choice. The  Taramani
Talkies  offers Indian and Chinese food, while the Baalcony,  the
rooftop section has Chettinad cuisine alone.

The  Baalcony,  opened a few months ago, doesn't have  any  filmi
frills.  The  only  embellishment is the sky, the  moon  and  the
stars,  that  is  if  it is a clear night.  The  brief  menu  was
predominantly non-vegetarian.

Though  two  soups  are  mentioned in the  menu,  both  were  not
available. For the maincourse, there were Kallu Dosa, Idli, Appam
and  Idiyappam,  very much the homefare. The  Idiyappams  (string
hoppers)  were  as soft too as the homemade ones. One  is  a  bit
apprehensive  about  ordering idiyappams at restaurants  as  more
often than not, they come dry. Then no amount of soaking in gravy
make their journey down the throat easy.

What  makes Chettinad cuisine so interesting is its not so  usual
combinations.  Idli and dosa, which make the very  foundation  of
South Indian vegetarian food, acquire non-vegetarian flavour also
here. So besides Sambar and Chutney, we have Mutton Kola  Urundai
Kozhambu  or Chettinad Kozhi or Meen Varuval as side dishes.  The
result  is,  if the crisp, thin light brown dosa,  hot  from  the
tava,  is  irresistible with sambar, it becomes a  knockout  when
touched  up  with  meaty/fish flavour. The  Baalcony  has  Mutton
Kheema Dosa and Prawn Dosa to substantiate the point.

Chettinad  Cuisine  comes  from the royal  kitchens  of  merchant
princes,  the  Chettiars.  The key word here  is  royal,  for  it
explains the characteristic richness of this culinary style.  The
wedding feasts of the Nagarathar Community are almost  legendary.
On  these occasions which run into days, the guests are feted  by
exemplary food and excellent music and dance.

Aattukal Paya, a rather mild mutton curry with coconut milk, went
well  with  the  idiyappams. Varutha Kozhi also  was  nice.  What
struck one most was the meagre inclusions of vegetarian dishes on
the  menu. There was only one semi-fried mixed  vegetables  dish,
vegetable  Chettinad  which  had  at  least  something   remotely
Chettinad about it. The other vegetarian items listed on the menu
were  Mulagutawny  Soup,  which  is of  British  Raj  origin  and
vegetable Kuruma.

But  at  the end of the meal, when you get a bill  of  less  than
three   hundred  bucks  for  a  couple  who  is  bothered   about
authenticity and lack of choice? And the food is quite nice too!

Specialist openers, need of the hour

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. d

By R. Mohan

TORONTO, Sept. 26.

Life's  journey from celebrated years as the well feted whiz  kid
to  middle  age can be very long. It is, perhaps,  the  curse  of
Sachin  Tendulkar  that  the experience of life,  like  his  lost
childhood, should be so compressed.

In  terms  of  cricket, he has already attained  middle  age.  If
anyone wishes to pick an argument about that, it is quite  likely
he  may not have seen the stony expression on the skipper's  face
when  he  went up to receive the loser's cheque in  the  deciding
game of the Sahara Cup on Monday.

"It was disappointing," he said in a kind of under statement at
the press conference. "We were very confident about chasing  214
but   we  could  not,"  he  said.  A  dead  giveaway  that   the
vicissitudes  of the captaincy are catching up with him  even  as
expectations turn into disappointments so quickly.

The captaincy, much like the rose, comes with the thorns. But  he
hardly  needs to blame himself so much because had the toss  gone
the  other way it was likely that the match and the Cup may  have
gone the other way, too.

The toss matters a lot on wearing pitches because chasing on them
is never going to be fun. His predecessor learnt a bitter  lesson
at  the Eden Gardens and Sachin accepted that the most  important
thing  he  learnt from the Sahara Cup is chasing is  never  easy.
Leaving  aside  for the moment the matter of chasing  or  setting
targets, let us examine where India really went wrong.

Notwithstanding the desire to be tactically flexible, the team is
erring  in  believing  the batting order  is  everything.  Sachin
himself  may  have brought about a seminal event in  opening  the
innings at the Eden Park in Auckland two years ago. But he should
know by now that changes in the batting order form only a part of
tactical innovativeness.

Results should be more even irrespective of the batting order  or
the availability or absence of leading batsmen through injury  or
disciplinary action as in the famous case of Navjot Sidhu.
A  32-16-2 (win-loss-no result) head-to-head record in favour  of
Pakistan  in  one-day  Internationals  exists  despite  all   the
tinkering  with the batting order that captains and their  think-
tanks have done over the years.

The  problem  right  now for India is the absence  of  a  regular
opening  partner for Sachin Tendulkar. It is another matter  that
it should not be assumed that Sachin should always be the  opener
in  the  limited-overs game. Such a  supposition  also  militates
against tactical flexibility.

This may be solved when Sidhu can return to the side in time  for
the  triangular  series  in the middle of  next  month.  But  the
selectors,  the  captain and whoever constitutes  his  think-tank
then should decide straightaway that the need for a specialist to
do this job is very urgent.

It is possible to compromise on the opening slot in home  cricket
where the fastest bowlers, be they white, black or brown, are  so
defeated by the conditions that they can be rendered pathetically
ineffectual.  But  the moment the Indian team  steps  abroad  and
comes across unfamiliar pitches, any tactical change of the order
can get horribly undone.

For  instance, Mongia is never likely to succeed  against  clever
fast bowlers like Wasim Akram. And Jadeja is unlikely to ever fit
the  role  of an opener again even if he succeeds at the  job  on
flat pitches as he has in Asia.

There  is one simple rule when it comes to opening batsmen.  `And
that  is - `Find specialists'. Don't ever compromise  unless  the
opener is a quality player of the calibre of Sachin Tendulkar who
can cope with the technical demands of playing the new ball  even
when  it comes to adapting oneself to the aggressive way  of  the
one-day game.

What is the point in carrying a Vikram Rathore in the squad if he
is  not  to  be used even in the one-day game.  Whatever  be  his
technical weaknesses, he can still cope with the requirements  of
the  one-day  game. Use him or Sidhu, not Jadeja, or  Mongia,  or
even Saurav Ganguly even if he is good enough a player of the new
ball to be considered for the job.

The  easy solution to team balance that Manoj Prabhakar  used  to
offer  as opener spoiled the Indian team thoroughly. The  era  of
the  all  rounders  is  well  behind us  now.  There  is  no  use
pretending that every Tom, Dick and Harry is an all rounder until
the  era of the true all-rounder comes again. The solution  would
then lie in giving a run to the specialists like Sidhu and  leave
it  to  them to work out how active they should be in  the  early
overs.

Krish  Srikkanth was a natural at the job of striker. The  nation
is  not going to find too many like him. Pinch hitters at one  or
two drop may fare well enough. But not too many converted openers
can  shine all the time as the specialists like Gordon  Greenidge
and Desmond Haynes did. We do not have to seek far to see why the
West Indians were so great as a one-day team in the days of their
absolute dominance. They always used specialist openers. They did
not believe in sending some hit-and-giggle batsmen in first.
Bring on Sidhu or give Rathore a fair run. But do not  compromise
on  the  opening  slot even in home  cricket  merely  because  it
becomes  convenient  to do so. The number of  times  Kapil  Dev's
promotion in the order failed is reason enough to suggest not all
are equipped to come out and bat first.

It  would  even  make sense to send in  a  quality  batsman  like
Azharuddin  to  open  the innings. But it  would  be  foolish  to
persist with the likes of Jadeja and Mongia.

Mrunalini earns IWM norm

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. c

By Arvind Aaron

YEREVAN, Sept. 26.

India's  Mrunalini  Kunte  made her  maiden  International  Woman
Master norm with a quick draw against WGM E. Zayac of Belarus  in
the tenth round of the 32nd Chess Olympiad here at the Sports and
Concert  Complex here today. The Indian women drew  1.5-1.5  with
Belarus.

Mrunalini Kunte, born on December 23, 1973 near Bombay, is a post
graduate  in  Commerce from Pune. She is  the  reigning  national
women's  champion  and should be able to get her other  norms  in
such strong opposition. Mrunalini's real strength in chess is her
ability to draw games against tougher opponents.

Mrunalini  said, "I am happy," as she was filling the form  for
norm  application  this  evening. She spent  the  last  48  hours
calculating  rather  than preparing for the match.  The  off  day
tomorrow would be the time to celebrate.

For  the Indian women IWM Saritha Reddy did the scoring,  beating
A.  Sorokina  in  43 moves with  the  white  pieces.  Bhagyashree
Thipsay  was beaten by untitled T.Zagorskaya in a  Dutch  defence
game.  Bhagyashree lost a pawn with the black pieces and  lost  a
couple more to resign in 44 moves.

India: Madras Stock Exchange online trading inaugurated

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 19, Col. a

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

The  screen-based  trading  on  the  Madras  Stock  Exchange  was
formally inaugurated by Mr. Suresh Krishna, Chairman and Managing
Director, Sundram Fasteners.

Speaking  on the occasion Mr. Suresh Krishna said this  marked  a
new  chapter  for  MSE which had a good carrier in  the  last  60
years.  He wanted the MSE to enter into new areas  of  operations
such as derivative trading.

The  first deal on online trading was put through by selling  100
shares of Sundram Fasteners by Mr. Suresh Krishna at Rs. 700  and
Mr. Prem Sundara Iyengar, President of the MSE was the buyer.
Mr.  Suresh Krishna left a word of caution that only quality  and
prompt delivery schedule would pave the way to success. He  cited
the  examples of multinationals like General Motors and  Ford  in
maintaining quality.

He  said  the  same  accepted business  norms  applied  to  stock
exchanges  and brokers also. He said "we cannot be operating  on
the  same  way  that  we  were  doing  and  have  to  adopt   new
technologies.  It  is  very important  to  build  confidence  and
quality  and without quality and trust stock exchanges  will  not
survive."  He  hoped  the MSE would live up to  its  ability  to
satisfy  the  most discerning customers and Mantrra  would  offer
efficient service to the investors.

Mr. S. Sadagopan, Chief General Manager, Madras Telephones,  said
that  they would be able to complete the job of  providing  lease
lines  in a short time and said the  international  communication
traffic  to  Madras was growing at a fast pace. He was  happy  to
note  that the trading system through leased lines network  would
be  one  of  the largest of such networks  for  mission  critical
applications in the Asia Pacific region.

Earlier, Mr. Prem Sundara Iyengar, President of the MSE said  the
screen-based  trading would be fully operational from  October  7
and appreciated the efforts taken by the members of the  Exchange
and  the  software  professionals involved in the  work  and  the
Madras Telephones in providing the lease lines.

Mr.  Chandra Balaraman, Chairman and Managing Director of  Indigo
Technologies,  which executed the project for  Tandem  Computers,
said  the  system  was very  reliable  with  parallel  processing
facilities.   He   said  TESA   (Tandem   Electronic   Securities
Architecture),  the software, being in use in  several  countries
had been customised by Indigo Technologies for MSE. He added  the
system  based on wide area network using leased lines  was  user-
friendly and cost effective.

Mr. Frank Dorrian, Regional Director of Tandem Computers for Asia
said it was a major step forward in automation of equity  markets
in India.

India-Corporate Results: MAC Industries

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. e

MAC  Industries  has  successfully  implemented  the  scheme  for
absorbing MAC Property Development and MAC Civil Engineers  after
getting  the  approval  of the shareholders and  the  High  Court
effective  from April 1, 1995. The working results  for  1995-96,
even  though they include the turnover of the merging  companies,
were  not  satisfactory because of the poor contribution  by  the
aquaculture  division.  The impact of virus disease in  both  the
farm  areas  in Tamil Nadu was so severe that  the  turnover  has
declined  to Rs. 127.41 crores from Rs. 158.11 crores  even  with
the contribution of Rs. 29.78 crores by the two merged  companies
referred to above.

The  gross profit before depreciation and interest  charges  also
dropped  abruptly  to  Rs. 930.96 lakhs from  Rs.  17.61  crores.
Interest  charges  were  lower at Rs. 554.22  lakhs  (Rs.  614.79
lakhs). The sum set aside for depreciation has been raised to Rs.
175.23  lakhs (Rs. 133.34 lakhs). The liability for  taxation  is
lower at Rs. 30 lakhs (Rs. 56 lakhs). The distributable profit is
only Rs. 171.51 lakhs against Rs. 956.27 lakhs.

The directors however have decided to maintain the dividend at 25
per cent, taxable. The prospects for the current year are  viewed
with  optimism. It was possible to maintain the dividend  because
of a larger amount brought in from the previous year. The  amount
required  is  Rs. 370.69 lakhs (Rs. 283.84 lakhs) as  the  equity
shares  issued in 1994-95 are eligible for a  full  distribution.
The  transfer  to  general reserve is Rs.  1  crores  (same)  and
debenture redemption reserve Rs. 165.67 lakhs (Rs. 53 lakhs). The
surplus  carried forward is Rs. 437.73 lakhs against  Rs.  969.73
lakhs brought in which includes Rs. 32.19 lakhs being net surplus
of amalgamated companies.

The paid up equity capital has increased to Rs. 14.82 crores from
Rs.  14.44 crores as a result of the merger while  reserves  were
lower  at Rs. 45.89 crores against Rs. 47.95 crores as the  outgo
in respect of dividend is more than available profits.

The  palm  plantation in Andhra Pradesh  is  making  satisfactory
progress  and an area of 1,025 hectares has been cultivated.  The
palm oil crushing mill has also commenced trial production.

India-Corporate Results: Shalimar Paints

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. e

Shalimar Paints has registered a net profit of Rs. 2.09 crores on
a  turnover of Rs. 120.02 crores in the 12 months ended June  30,
1996  against Rs. 1.03 crores and Rs. 107.79 crores  respectively
in 1994-95.

The  gross profit, before depreciation and interest charges,  has
risen to Rs. 11.43 crores from Rs. 10.89 crores. Interest charges
claimed  Rs. 7.35 crores (Rs. 7.29 crores). The amount set  aside
for  depreciation is Rs. 1.99 crores (Rs. 1.09 crores). In  1994-
95, an amount of Rs. 1.48 crores has been provided as bad debts.
The company has projected a net profit of Rs. 5.29 crores in  the
letter of offer when it issued partly convertible debentures on a
right basis. As the powder coating project has been deferred  and
there  was  also an increase in input costs, it could  achieve  a
lower  net  profit  of Rs. 2.09 crores. It  is  stated  that  the
company  has not availed itself of the term loan intended  to  be
raised for the powder coating plant.

India-Corporate Results: BPL Refrigeration

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. e

BPL  Refrigeration has been increasing its market share with  the
introduction  of  new  types  of  frost-free  refrigerators   and
increasing production. But for the fire accident in the  existing
factory at Bangalore the working results for the year ended March
31, 1996 would have made even better showing. As there is a  loss
of output for one week due to the accident and also a  slackening
in  growth  momentum  subsequently, it is  anticipated  that  the
progress in 1996-97 will be more impressive. New models also will
be  marketed  and  arrangements  are  being  made  for   complete
designing with engineers getting the requisite training from  the
Japanese collaborators, Sanyo.

Sales  have risen by 63.1 per cent to Rs. 215.96 crores from  Rs.
132.37  crores  and  the gross  profit  before  depreciation  and
interest  charges by 59.2 per cent to Rs. 28.68 crores  from  Rs.
18.02  crores  in 1994-95. Interest charges have spurted  to  Rs.
14.07   crores  (Rs.  6.80  crores).  The  sum  set   aside   for
depreciation  is  Rs. 450.69 lakhs (Rs. 314.89 lakhs).  There  is
again no liability for taxation. The residual profit has risen in
a less pronounced manner (25.1 per cent) to Rs. 10.11 crores from
Rs. 8.08 crores mainly due to heavier burden of interest charges.
The  dividend  has  been  maintained at  20  per  cent,  taxable,
absorbing Rs. 544.44 lakhs (Rs. 468.74 lakhs). The larger  amount
is  due  to  the equity shares allotted to  the  promoters  at  a
premium of Rs. 38.44 per share being eligible for a proportionate
distribution.  The  transfer to general reserve is  Rs.  1  crore
(same)  and debenture redemption reserve Rs. 2.25 crores  (same).
The  surplus  carried  forward is Rs. 378.16  lakhs  against  Rs.
236.38 lakhs brought in.

The  paid up capital has increased to Rs. 29.64 crores  from  Rs.
24.94  crores  as  a result of the allotment of  94  lakh  equity
shares  of Rs. 10 each at the above mentioned premium. These  are
paid  up  to the extent of 75 per cent. Reserves  amount  to  Rs.
87.52  crores after giving effect to the latest  allocations  and
taking  credit  also for the premium on  the  preferential  issue
against Rs. 64.78 crores.

During the period under reference, the company reported an income
of  Rs.  133.63 crores against Rs. 98.90 crores.  Other  receipts
were  lower  at Rs. 60 lakhs against Rs. 114.60  lakhs.  The  net
profit,  before  depreciation and taxation, has improved  to  Rs.
67.31 crores from Rs. 54.94 crores.

After providing a sum of Rs. 26.14 crores (Rs. 20.46 crores)  for
depreciation  and  Rs. 1 crore (Rs. 72 lakhs) for  taxation,  the
residual  profit is higher at Rs. 40.17 crores against Rs.  33.77
crores.

The transfer to general reserve is Rs. 15 crores (same),  general
reserve  No.  1  Rs. 10 crores  (nil)  and  debenture  redemption
reserve  Rs. 5 crores (nil). Reserves stood at Rs. 188.91  crores
on  June  30, 1996 against the unchanged paid up capital  of  Rs.
11.84 crores.

India: Procedures for NRI investments simplified

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. d

From Our Staff Correspondent

MUMBAI, Sept. 26.

The Reserve Bank of India has further simplified the policies and
procedures  for NRI investments. The present scheme for  100  per
cent   investment  by  NRIs  in  sick  units  will   be   further
liberalised.

The  RBI  will  give general permission for  interest  free  non-
repatriable  loans from NRI relatives for personal  purposes  and
for business activities. Interest free repatriable loans up to  $
2.5  lakhs with a maturity of seven years will be cleared by  the
RBI  automatically. Other cases will continue to be cleared on  a
case to case basis by the RBI.

NRIs/OCBs will be permitted to establish schools and colleges  on
the  same  terms  and  conditions as  a  resident  individual  or
corporate body.

The  existing  40  per cent scheme will  be  abolished.  In  non-
Annexure-III  industries, investments by NRIs/OCBs up to  51  per
cent in companies other than listed companies will be allowed  on
a repatriation basis.

The  condition  regarding  60 per  cent  turnover  from  eligible
activities  for  investment to be eligible under the old  40  per
cent and the proposed 51 per cent scheme will be waived.
NRI  participation in venture capital activity will be  permitted
on  the same terms and conditions as foreign investment  in  this
area.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and other  housing
finance institutions will be permitted to grant loans to NRIs for
acquisition  or improvement to the existing houses on  terms  and
conditions  as applicable to residents. All information  relating
to NRI or foreign investment will be put on the Internet.

Microbe capable of degrading oil isolated

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 17, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

TIRUCHI, Sept. 26.

A  microbe  existing in nature named pseudomonas which  has  been
found to be capable of degrading oil, has been isolated by Mr. P.
Raghavan a research scholar, working under Prof. M. Vivekanandan,
Head  of  Department  of  Bio-technology,  of  the  Bharathidasan
University, after studies for the past 30 months.

Oil  spilling both on land and sea in recent years, has  been  on
the increase, and is posing challenges to the  environmentalists.
Bioremediation  is  considered  to be the most  useful  and  safe
method to deal with oil pollution of any kind in view of the fact
that  it  was  considered to be  most  eco-friendly.

Genetically  engineered  strains though have  been  developed  to
fight  oil spillage, in view of the potential danger involved  in
using  such  methods,  the governments have banned  it.  In  this
context,  the utilisation of such naturally occurring oil  eating
microbes assumes very great importance.

The microbe Pseudomonas Sp was isolated from the oil-contaminated
site. The potential nature of this strain in utilising crude  oil
as  the sole source of energy was investigated. The  isolate  was
found  to degrade oil at 1 to 3% level with an efficiency of  60-
90%.   The  optimal  conditions  for  biodegradation   like   PH,
temperature, PO4, and salinity requirements were also worked out.
The  degree  of  oil biodegradation depends  on  the  quantum  of
emulsifying agent produced by the strain.

When  there was minimum surface tension, the quantum  of  biomass
and   biosurfactant  production  was  maximal  by  the   isolate.
Immobilised cells produce increased amount of biosurfactant.  The
nature  of  biosurfactant  was  identified  as  rhamnolipid.  The
electro-micrograph  of the oil-degrading strain showed  that  the
cells  growing in high concentration of oil, exhibited  a  larger
periplasmic  space and cell membrane evagiation.

The  antibiogram  of the strain also showed tolerance to  Hg  and
phenol.  The conjugation study of this strain with E. Coli  CSH57
revealed  that  the strain has the ability to transfer  only  the
antibiotic resistance and not the oil-degrading character.  Field
trial test involving the adapted microbial strain at oil spillage
site  will  be  a promising approach  which  is  being  currently
investigated.

India: Adult TV channel jinxed?

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 16, Col. e

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The much-publicised adult TV channel, "Plus 21", is turning out
to  be a non-starter and its proposed launch on October  1  looks
extremely  unlikely  even as cable operators  are  besieged  with
enquiries about its contents, timings and how it can be accessed.
The  launch,  already  postponed several times,  may  be  delayed
further  for  a host of reasons,  including  non-availability  of
hardware  and two court cases seeking a ban on the channel  under
obscenity  laws. Sources in the cable industry say even  software
is not ready, and even if the channel takes off in a few weeks it
would  not be able to offer the full range of programming it  has
been promising.

At  least  three film-makers have contested the  channel's  claim
that they are making programmes for it and accused it of misusing
their names. Film Director B. R. Ishaara has denied making even a
single episode of "Kamasutra", which the "Plus-21" channel is
advertising as his creation.

Film actress and Director Neena Gupta too has dissociated herself
from  the  serial and expressed surprise that her name  is  being
used  to promote the channel. According to her, she was asked  to
make the serial but midway she fell out with the channel and  has
nothing  to  do with it now. Another Director, Ajit  Dewani,  has
accused  the  channel  of  illegally  appropriating  his   serial
"Abhinetri."

This  is  India's  first  own  "adult"  TV  channel  and  cable
operators  are  not  quite  sure if  they  can  beam  it  without
violating  the  Cable TV Regulation Act  1994,  which,  prohibits
telecasting any programme that "offends good taste or decency".
The sort of steamy stuff, it has promised, has already provoked a
strong  reaction  with  voluntary  organisations  threatening   a
nationwide agitation.

Council threatens stir

The National Consumer Awareness Council, which represents over 80
voluntary bodies, has gone to court and said it would take to the
streets  if the channel is allowed to go on air.  Besides,  cable
operators   in   some  cities  have  been  cautioned   by   local
"watchdogs"  and  according to the Federation of  Indian  Cable
Operators' associations, which represents 25,000 operators across
the country, its members are very reluctant to take chances.
"We  will not beam the channel unless we have the  equipment  to
trap its signal so that it is restricted to those homes which ask
for  it. Once we have this equipment we would give a code to  the
subscriber  so that he can lock the channel to  prevent  children
watching it", says Ms. Roop Sharma, president of the federation.
Unless  cable operators are able to "isolate" the  channel  and
restrict its use to individuals who have the code, it would be  a
free-to-air channel which once beamed by a cable operator can  be
seen  by  anyone. Major cable distributors such as  Hindujas  and
Siticable are also reluctant to "risk" the ire of those who are
opposed to "invasion" of their privacy.

According to the promotional material distributed by the  channel
it  would  be  on the air for four hours  every  night  (10  p.m.
onwards)  and would feature "adult jokes, sex news,  titillating
music, adult songs, adult comedies and serials such as Kamasutra,
Redlight,  Ek  Aur Silsila, Samjhauta, Brothel and  Bhog  Se  Yog
Tak". It has also claimed that it would "prominently  feature"
advertisements of "adult stuff".

Cable  operators  say  such  advertising  on  an  Indian  channel
violates the advertising code which they are expected to  follow.
They can also be hauled up for telecasting programmes which  have
not been censored as required under the Cinematograph Act.
A  senior executive of the channel has, however, denied  that  it
proposes  to air nudity and pointed out that in any case some  of
the programmes on foreign TV networks beamed to Indian homes  are
not fit for family viewing.

Even  as the channel appears to be in trouble even before it  has
kicked  off,  there  is a sense of anticipation  among  the  more
curious  viewers  whose appetite has been whetted  by  the  media
hype.

Rs. 3.3 crores  during the nine-day Brahmothsavam which concluded
on Monday.

Collections  from the hundi accounted for Rs. 2.53  crores  while
the  sale  of  different seva tickets fetched Rs.  53  lakhs  and
laddus Rs. 24 lakhs.

According  to the TTD, about five lakh pilgrims visited the  hill
temple  and 1.72 lakhs had free meals under the Nithya  Annadanam
scheme.  The APSRTC, which pressed into service extra buses,  has

India-TV: Renuke Shahane: Choosy about her roles

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 32, Col. a

Who  is  not  familiar with her warm,  toothy  smile  and  bright
persona on the small screen? Renuka Shahane lights up the  entire
viewing  room  with her vivacious screen presence, be it  in  the
much-appreciated  "Surabi"  (with Siddharth Kak) or  the  much-
watched  "Antakshari" (with Annu Kapoor). Renuka is  now  being
seen more and more in serials too. You just cannot miss her on TV
any  given day of the week. She is "to hand" on one channel  or
another.

"To  think it has all come to me unsought!" notes Renuka, as  I
come face to face with this blithe spirit of the small screen  at
her Shivaji Park home in the Dadar sector of Mumbai. But whatever
is the matter, Renuka is not, right now, her known spirited self?
She  is  out  of sorts because she is nursing  a  rather  painful
abscess.  I  encountered  her a couple  of  weeks  before  Ganesh
Chaturthi.  And  the young lady is, literally, waiting  for  Lord
Ganesa to come and go, so as to be able to get rid of the pain in
which she obviously is.

"I  have  to be careful not in any way to upset my  tight  work-
schedule  in planning to go through the minor  surgery  needed,"
she  points out. "Therefore, this surgery has willy-nilly to  be
on Ganpati immersion day, the day when we busy stars at last  get
24 hours off."

She  had braced herself for the mini-ordeal ahead and is  not  in
the  ideal  frame  of mind to answer my query  about  why  Renuka
Shahane seems to be doing only a handful of serials while others,
who  came after her, look to be much busier. I put the  point  to
her,  none  the less, and Renuka takes it in her  petite  stride,
explaining  why,  if  she  is lagging behind,  she  is  doing  so
studiedly.

"I am not very ambitious by way of quantity, it is purely out of
choice I have restricted myself," says Renuka. "According to my
lights,  "too  much"  is not the yardstick by  which  a  viewer
should  be judging a performer's calibre. I would rather be  seen
in well-defined roles, in a few well-made serials, than be viewed
in  every  other tele-offering, frantically running from  set  to
set.

"It is important for me to be seen "doing" things in a  serial
as a character rather than be merely appearing in it. That is the
reason  I left "Yeh Huyi Na Baat." My character in it  was  not
developing  at  all, it seemed to be getting me nowhere.  On  the
other hand, I have enjoyed doing Kishan Sethi's "Ghutan,"  even
if  all  the  major roles in this serial  are  played  by  mature
artistes  like Raza Murad, Kiran Kumar and Smita Jaykar. Still  I
have a role to play as the motivating daughter of Smita and  Raza
who brings matters to a head."

Renuka Shahane has been appreciated for her "quietly" effective
performance  in  "9  Malabar Hill," the  Siddharth  Sen  Gupta-
directed  serial in which her's is the main role.  Notes  Renuka:
"I've  been very happy with "Imtehaan" and  "Sailaab,"  both
directed  by  Ravi Rai, who is a good script-writer too.  I  felt
particularly  happy with my role in "Imtehaan," it was  shaping
up  really  well and we looked poised for more  exciting  things,
when it was yanked off the screen at the end of the 26th episode.
Did I feel disappointed!"

Now  to the "role" in which she is so omnipresent on the  small
screen!  There  seems  to be a rather mixed  reaction  to  Renuka
Shahane  as Annu Kapoor's bubbly co-host in "Antakshari."  Some
argue  she  hogs  the show; others say she is  too  subdued;  yet
others feel her costuming, her get-up seem all wrong. But  Renuka
is  dismissive  of  the suggestion that either  she  or  Annu  is
domineering.

"You cannot," she reasons, "be dominant in a live musical show
like  "Antakshari"  where it is so much a matter  of  give-and-
take. Our first priority here is to put the participants at ease.
Annu  is very comfortable in Hindi, it is his mother tongue.  And
he  sees to it that at no point does viewer interest in the  show
flag,  at  no stage does any participant get a feeling  of  being
intimidated. The chalking out of the programme is done in a  very
congenial  and  friendly  atmosphere,  an  atmosphere  in   which
director Gajendra Singh, Annu and I, all three, take part in  the
discussion  freely. As for my costuming, it is the choice of  the
sponsors,  I cannot help it if certain viewers feel it  does  not
suit me."

For  Renuka,  everything in her professional  life  has  happened
naturally.  Even  that  Filmfare  award  for  her  Marathi  film,
"Aboli," came to her just like that. "I had no inkling I would
get  it ahead of so many talented and deserving  artistes,"  she
says, having grown up in a part of Mumbai known for its erudition
and achievement.

This  must  explain why Renuka is so choosy about what  she  does
even in a spot medium like TV. But viewers judge her,  instantly,
by  what  they see. From the moment she was picked  up  by  Gulan
Kripalani  to  play  Pankaj  Berry's  wife  in  that   rollicking
breakfast  serial, "P. C. Aur Mousi" (a show in which she  came
in  rewarding contact with Farida Jalal) to now (when  the  whole
viewing world is still toasting her as the charming elder bahu of
Rajshri's Hum Aapke Hain Koun), there is nothing Renuka has  gone
after for it to come to her."I am anxious only to the extent  of
being  conscientious  about  giving my one hundred  per  cent  to
anything  in hand, be it my work or studies. Never have I  sought
the easy way out where it comes to making the effort," she says.
One thing has led to another and Renuka feels happy to have  come
in live touch with some of the more creative talents of the small
screen.

"I  value my work in Vijaya Mehta's "Lifeline,"  says  Renuka.
"During  the  doing of "Surabhi," Siddharth  Kak's  guideline,
that  the  two  of us should not be talking down  to  people  but
chatting to the camera, came as a most timely tip. I have  reason
to  be  grateful  to Annu Kapoor for  his  protectively  friendly
smoothing over of certain awkward moments before the camera while
working  on  "Antakshari." I treasure,  too,  the  enlightening
hours  spent with director Pushkar Singh while doing  that  brief
but significant serial of just six episodes: "Akanksha"  (based
on  the  theme of adoption). Money, for me, is  not  everthing,"
concludes  Renuka by way of justifying her laid-back attitude  to
life and career.

Maybe  it is just the literary milieu in which she has  grown  up
that  enables  Renuka  Shahane to look upon  TV  star  status  as
something  that is not the end of the world. "For me, there  are
other  attractions  in life," says  Renuka,  still  attractively
single. "I like doing theatre, seeing good plays, taking in good
cinema reading, devoting time to literature, even plain relaxing.
All  this  is  invaluable for my well-being.  There  is  so  much
happening, so much to absorb."

A  sound head on slim shoulders - that is Renuka Shahane, the  TV
star with a difference.

India: Situation will be clear in 20 days: Waghela

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 16, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The political situation in Gujarat is expected to become clear in
the  next  20  days, immediately after the  by-elections  in  the
State. This was the view of the Gujarat BJP dissident leader,  Mr
Shankarsinh Waghela, who met the press here today on his way back
to Ahmedabad from Lucknow.

Mr  Waghela was confident that there would be no  difficulty  for
the  Mahagujarat Janata Party led by Mr Dilip Parikh  in  getting
the  support of at least four or five of the 18 MLAs  "virtually
kept prisoner" by the BJP.

"In  any case the Mehta Governments inning's are over. There  is
no  question  of the BJP making Mr. Suresh Mehta  Chief  Minister
again.  From  the very start it was Mr. Keshubhai Patel  who  was
chosen  for that chair, and again, the BJP will try to bring  him
back as Chief Minister," Mr. Waghela said emphatically.
He alleged that `private police' were used inside the Assembly on
that  fateful  September 18 and that  mediapersons  were  `beaten
mercilessly'. He said that many journalists were later threatened
that night and some feared for their lives. "The Deputy  Speaker
was also taken ill because threats were issued to him and in  the
hospital  he  was  given  a heavy  dose  of  sedation  making  it
impossible  for him to chair the next day's  Assembly  session,"
Mr.  Waghela charged, adding that "no one could prevent the  BJP
Government  from forming a government in Gujarat if  they  remain
sure  of their majority. They can go to Raj Bhawan  tomorrow  and
claim that they have the necessary support. Who can stop  them?"
he asked.

He added that on September 18, there were only 87 MLAs present in
the  House after police threw out the Opposition MLAs.  According
to him, only 87 votes were cast in favour of the so-called motion
seeking a vote of confidence.

He admitted that he had gone to Lucknow `to warn' the people  not
to  believe  the BJP and its leadership, and not be taken  in  by
their  promises.  He said that in Lucknow he did meet  `some  BJP
leaders,'  but refused to identify them, saying `they would  lose
their  jobs'.  In  response to questions, he  admitted  that  the
`promises'  made  to him by Mr Atal Behari  Vajpayee  after  last
September's  episode  were  not kept by the  party.  He  implied,
without saying this in so many words, that Mr Vajpayee was unable
to have his say in the party.

India: 14 airports to be developed for global operations

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 15, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

With  the expansion of private airlines in the  domestic  sector,
the  Government has decided to develop 14 airports including  the
12  model  airports,  for limited  international  operations,  in
addition to the major airports.

The  private  airlines  has  made it  necessary  to  provide  for
additional  parking  and  maintenance  facilities.  New  terminal
buildings  to serve the increased number of passengers are  being
commissioned  and  airports  made  consumer  friendly,  with  the
augmentation  of passenger amenities for better baggage  handling
and check-in facilities.

The  model  airports include Lucknow, Jaipur,  Nagpur,  Vadodara,
Kozhikode,   Coimbatore,  Indore,  Hyderabad,  Patna,   Guwahati,
Bhubaneswar,  Imphal, Goa and Ahmedabad. The airports  have  been
identified  by AAI from the economic and tourism point  of  view.
Modernisation  of  air  traffic  services  with  state-of-the-art
communication,  navigation and surveillance system will be  taken
up in a phased manner.

New  airports  are  being constructed  particularly  in  interior
places  such as Tura in Meghalaya and Lengpuri in  Mizoram  under
the State plans, and Kargil and Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir and
Andorth in Lakshadweep funded by the Central Government.
At the Kozhikode airport, a new international terminal block with
all  amenities for handling 400 passengers, was  commissioned  in
June  this year. At Ahmedabad, extension of runway from  9000  to
11,500  feet  has been taken up. At Hassan, an  airport  will  be
developed for the 50-seater aircraft operation over 295 acres for
Rs. 50 crores in the first phase. In the second phase the airport
will  be extended to 9000 feet with Rs. 60 crores more to  enable
Boeing 737 operation.

Dustin Hoffman: Cinema"s diminutive dynamo

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 25, Col. a

Thirty years after he became Hollywood's newest "Graduate",  he
remains  one  of its most skilled practitioners. A  look  at  the
memorable  screen moments of Dustin Hoffman,  honoured  recently,
for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival

"Mrs.  Robinson, do you think we could say a few words  to  each
other first, this time"

"Mrs.   Robinson,  if  you  don't  mind  my  saying   so,   this
conversation is becoming a little strange".

"Mrs. Robinson you're trying to seduce me aren't you?"

"Maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson. Would
you like to go to a movie?"

The   increasingly  apprehensive  teenager  realises   that   the
middleaged  woman  (Anne Bancroft), who just happens  to  be  his
girlfriend's  (Katherine Ross) mother, is in fact practising  the
fine  art of seduction on him. Coming as it did, in  1967,  "The
Graduate",  unerringly tapped the mood of the swinging  Sixties,
mirrored  on the soundtrack, in the classic Simon  and  Garfunkel
songs  -  and became a milestone film, earning that  year's  Best
Director   Oscar   for   Mike   Nichols.   Nominated   -   albeit
unsuccessfully  -  was  the  chubby  faced  young  actor,  Dustin
Hoffman,  a diminutive 5 ft 6 ins, but at 31 much older than  the
character  he portrayed. Much imitated (Kamal Hassan  played  the
Hoffman  character in a derivative Tamil film), "The  Graduate"
continued to win new audiences in later decades via TV and video,
as a seminal Sixties product.

The film made Hoffman a star - and his style of studied, cerebral
acting,  a  cult. Over the next three decades,  this  deliberate,
sometimes eccentric practitioner of the now often derided art  of
emoting, has delivered some of cinema's most memorable moments.
At  the Venice Film Festival, earlier this month, Dustin  Hoffman
was  honoured  with  a special "Golden  Lion"  for  his  career
achievement  in  cinema. He quotes his guru  Lee  Straberg,  from
whose  "Method"  school  of acting  so  many  Hollywood  heroes
graduated: "There is no such thing as a juvenile, a villain or a
hero. We are all characters".

After "The Graduate", his very next bash at the big screen  was
a character, as eccentric as they came: the crippled,  aggressive
"Ratso",  who teams up with a gigolo (John Voight) as they  try
to  eke  out  a  living from the seedy  underside  of  New  York.
"Midnight Cowboy", became the first "X" rated film to win  an
Oscar - for its director John Schlesinger.

But  the  awesome histrionic talents in  the  pint-sized  Hoffman
frame  were  on display for the first time in 1970 when  he  aged
from a teenager - to 121 years, playing the only survivor of  the
infamous  Little Big Horn slaughter of American Indians. As  Jack
Crabb,  a boy brought up by the Cheyenne Indians,  Hoffman  plays
"Little Big Man", a witness to almost a century of exploitation
of  America's indigenous population by the whites. Arthur  Penn's
film   was  not  your  customary  hard  riding,   hard   drinking
"Western",  but  possibly the most sensitive portrayal  of  the
"Red" Indian way of life.

The  ultra  violent "Straw Dogs" which featured  Hoffman  (with
Susan  George)  in 1971 as an American research student  and  his
wife,  experiencing  the malevolence of the locals in  a  Cornish
village  in  Britain, was one of director  Sam  Peckinpah's  most
controversial  films.  The British, for one refused to  accept  a
plot where locals let loose a reign of terror including  multiple
rape in a sleepy village. It was never allowed into this country.
But the equally downbeat "Papillon" was. Based on a French best
seller,  the  story  followed the repeated attempts  of  a  penal
colony  inmate  (Steve  McQueen) to escape - aided  by  a  mousy,
myopic buddy (Hoffman). It was a star vehicle - and little  else.
High powered star power was in abundance, once more, when Hoffman
joined  Robert  Redford, in "All the  President's  Men'  (1976),
where  they  play the investigative duo Carl  Bernstein  and  Bob
Woodward,   who  cracked  the  Watergate  conspiracy  for   "The
Washington Post". The film had little to offer the  non-American
viewer who in any case was not so obsessed with this true saga of
President Nixon's downfall.

"My  dear  boy  have you ever tried  acting?"  asked  the  late
Shakespearean  thespian Laurence Olivier, of his co-star  Hoffman
during  the making of the bizarre often very convoluted  thriller
"Marathon  Man". But the old man's jibes apart, the film was  a
poor  showcase for either of them - and a nauseating scene  where
the neo Nazi Olivier does some unscheduled dental work on Hoffman
was only one of many violent moments.

But  acting talent was not a prerequisite for garnering Oscars  -
charisma  and star power could do the job - as Hoffman and  Meryl
Streep  proved  in  1979, playing a separated  husband  and  wife
battling over their kid in "Kramer versus Kramer". This  "four
hanky"  film won Hoffman his first Best Actor Award - and  other
honours  went to the film, to costar Streep, the director  Robert
Benton and the scriptwriters.

Never  one to rest on his laurels, Hoffman went on to take up  an
unusual  challenge, that would have daunted most macho stars:  In
the 1982 comedy "Tootsie" he appears in drag most of the  time,
playing  an  indigent actor who takes up female roles to  make  a
living.  This unlikely critical success was followed by what  the
industry  termed  a  "fifty million  dollar  flop":  "Ishtar"
teamed him with Warren Beatty. The two play a pair of second rate
songsters  writers  who  stumble on a spy  drama  in  the  Sahara
desert. Their constant companion is a blind camel. A wit said  at
the time, the film's audience had to be blind as well - to  enjoy
the film.

The  1988  Hoffman  starrer couldn't have  been  more  different.
"Rain Man" found him playing an autistic man - incoherent  most
of  the  time - who is left $3 million  dollars.  His  avaricious
younger  brother  (Tom Cruise) is only left a vintage car  -  and
hopes  to trick his sick brother out of his inheritance. They  go
on a long journey in the jalopy - and by film's end, the  younger
sibling  has learnt to appreciate the goodness of his  "savant"
brother. In a year when "feel good" films were in short supply,
"Rain  Man"  stormed the Academy Awards -  earning  Oscars  for
Hoffman, the film and the director Barry Levinson among others.
It was a different type of family bonding a year later:  "Family
Business"  was  about a bunch of  unlikely  crooks:  grandfather
(Sean  Connery),  father  (Hoffman) and  son  (Mathew  Broderick)
decide  to pull off a heist. It was a great comic idea -  but  it
barely worked.

The Nineties saw Dustin Hoffman make fleeting appearances on  the
screen.  Spielberg's Peter Pan update, "Hook" cast him  as  the
villainous  title  character  - but there was little  to  do  for
Hoffman  the  actor  in this special  effects  costume  drama.  A
glimpse of what he could do with a good script was provided  last
year  when  he appeared in "Outbreak" as a  conscientious  army
doctor  battling  against top brass  (Donald  Sutherland,  Morgan
Freeman) to control a rampaging viral disease. But encase Hoffman
most  of the time in a protective headgear (and high tech  drama)
and you curb his talents. He needs the pure acting environment to
thrive.  Chances  are his latest vehicle might just  provide  him
with this. "American Buffalo", casts him alongside Dennis Franz
of  "NYPD  Blue"  fame as a pair of crooks who try  to  pull  a
confidence trick on a friend - with disastrous consequences.  The
film  being  made earlier this year, is due to be seen  in  India
later this year.

If  his  appearances on screen are infrequent,  that  is  because
Dustin Hoffman can afford to pick and choose his roles. "I lived
below the official American poverty line till I was 31" he  says
(that  was  the year he appeared in "The Graduate").  Then  the
arithmetic  of success changed and today Hoffman swears by a  new
formula:  "Stardom equals freedom. It is the only equation  that
matters' he says.

As he slides into his sixties, it is an equation that adds up  to
some more cinematic delights to come from Dustin Hoffman.

A zest for life

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 25, Col. e

Khushboo  was  in Bombay last week. For old times'  sake  we  had
lunch  at a suburban restaurant. The restaurant was  too  crowded
for  confrontations  and confessions. But in  between  soups  and
sweet  dishes,  we  managed  to  cover  topics  ranging  over  26
alphabets.

***

Amitabh  Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar and Arvind  Swamy.  I
cannot  think  beyond these performers. Amitabhji,  for  being  a
phenomenon,  Aamir  for his sensitivity towards  his  characters.
Akshay for his stamina and Arvind for his courteous behaviour.
Bombay  - I just love the city. Biscuits - Even if I were  to  be
woken  up  at two in the morning and offered  biscuits,  I  would
finish the packet.

Clothes  -  I  love  them,  specially  cotton  saris  and  salwar
kameezes.  I like dressing up. My family and friends feel I  look
good  in  modern  outfits, but I  prefer  myself  in  traditional
clothes.

Dogs  -  I just love them. The Alsatian bitch I have at  home  is
adorable. We got her when she was a week old. Today she is  four-
and-a-half and my mom's chamchi. I cannot touch mummy when she is
in the room. She is fiercely possessive about her.

Entertainment  -  Films,  theatre, circus,  road  side  tamashas,
anything, but life would be unbearable without entertainment.
Family  and  friends - They have been with me during my  ups  and
downs  - Brinda, Anu, Subbu, Madhoo, Viji - life wouldn't be  the
same, if I lost any one of them.

God - I am god fearing but not a religious fanatic. I respect all
religions and visit various shrines when I feel like.

Holidays - I have never been on a holiday, a planned holiday.  It
is only when my shootings get cancelled at the last minute that I
take a few days off. My folks at home never take my proposal  for
a holiday seriously. I have let them down too often.

India - I am proud to be an Indian, proud of my culture. We  have
so  much variety in food and attire in all our States.  Not  many
countries can promise that.

Jashn  Ali Khan - My three-year-old nephew. He is the love of  my
life.... my absolute jaan. On the day he was born, I insisted  on
holding  him first. And I did. I remember the expression when  he
opened  his  eyes. Right now he is in Indonesia and  I  miss  him
badly.  He gurgles on the phone. I love the way he calls me  Bua.
Sometimes he calls me Khusphus.

Kites  -  I love watching colourful kites in the  sky.  There  is
something romantic about them. Ever since childhood, my  brothers
made  me hold the manja-phirki, while they flew the kites.  After
all these years, the practice has not changed.

Love - I thrive on love and cannot survive without it. I can live
without  oxygen, but not love. London - It is a city I have  only
dreamt of, never visited. Strange that I have travelled all  over
Europe, except London.

Mother - We fight so often, but I cannot live without her either.
She  is  very important in my life and she knows  it.  She  takes
advantage  of this at times, supports my brothers  in  arguments,
even when she knows they are in the wrong.

Marriage  -  I  was  miserable  when  I  had  to  break  off  the
relationship I had invested so much into. I can never forget that
day. It was the worst day of my life. I had to learn it the  hard
way that nobody is perfect.

Nagging - I hate being nagged, so I can guess what a torture I am
to others.

Oorvasi - She is Tamil Nadu's most versatile actress and has made
a  name  for herself in all the South  Indian  languages.  Today,
almost  every heroine-oriented script is written with Oorvasi  in
mind. I truly admire her spontaneity.

Perfection - I am not a perfectionist. No matter how hard I  try,
I  can never attain perfection. Something, somewhere always  goes
wrong. May be, It is temperament, but I am hoping I will be  able
to rectify this when I become a housewife.

Quiz  Master Derek O'Brien of "Bournvita Quiz Contest" - He  is
too good! I try and watch the show whenever I can.

Rickshaws - Whenever in Bombay, I love travelling by rickshaws. I
don't get to do it in Madras. I also enjoy the double-decker  bus
rides in Bombay. Down South, we don't have it.

Sundar  -  He  is selfless, generous, mature and  my  whole  life
revolves around him. He is the man responsible for my confidence.
The  motivating  factor to assert myself as a woman. I  love  him
deeply  and cannot think of a future without him. Shabana Azmi  -
is  the woman I admire greatly. If I can acquire even an iota  of
the fame and respect she has, I will consider myself lucky.
Tantrums  -  A common feature with newcomers on  the  sets  these
days.  Youngsters think its is fashionable to be  arrogant.  Real
stars  don't  throw  their weight around. On  the  contrary,  the
bigger the star, the more normal his behaviour.

Ubin Fernandez - My hairdresser and friend. I call her  "aunty"
and  she  has been my guide and companion for 14 years.  She  has
been an integral part of my career. She treats me like her  child
and is fiercely loyal.

Victory  - I hate the word failure. Last year, when I  was  going
through  a low phase, people said it was over for me. The  papers
referred  to me in the past tense. It hurt and I swore to  myself
that I would get back. I did and that is a victory for me.
Work  -  Work is worship. I would be completely lost  without  my
work.  I am addicted to it. I cannot sit idle even when I am  not
well.  When  I  am  not shooting, I  am  busy  cooking,  cleaning
vessels,  floors and cupboards. For someone so active, my  weight
is a mystery.

X'mas  - I look forward to Christmas every year. Ubin aunty  gets
me homemade rose cookies and I just love them.

Youth - I like the feeling of youth. I may talk and behave mature
but at heart I am a teenager.

Zest  - Is what keeps me going... When I want to, I can be  goal-
oriented. I am determined when I am motivated.

India: SPG cover: V.P. Singh reiterates demand

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  former  Prime Minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, has  reiterated  his
demand  for immediate withdrawal of the Special Protection  Group
cover  to him and his immediate family members and said that  the
issue  of  withdrawal  of  SPG cover  should  not  be  linked  to
provision of alternative security cover.

Responding  to a letter written by the Prime Minister,  Mr.  H.D.
Deve   Gowda,  urging  him  to  consider  opting  for  "Z   plus"
alternative security cover, Mr. Singh has said that he will  keep
his options open.

"As for the alternative security cover suggested by you I keep my
options open for it will not be possible to accept an alternative
cover if it puts the same burden on the treasury and the poor man
as  the  SPG does at the moment must be costing  the  country  at
least  Rs.  60  crores a year for all the old  and  new  ex-Prime
Ministers,"  Mr.  Singh  has informed the  Prime  Minister  in  a
letter.

Mr.  Singh has said while he and his wife, Mrs. Sita Kumari,  are
signing  the letter, his two sons, Mr. Ajeya Singh and Mr.  Abhai
Singh, are at the moment abroad and will send similar requests on
arrival. "As no SPG cover is given to them abroad, the decks  are
cleared for immediate withdrawal of SPG".

India: End of the road for Narasimha Rao?

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. b

From Harish Khare

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

With  legal troubles coming like a torrent, there seems to be  no
political  respite  for  the former Prime  Minister,  Mr.  P.  V.
Narasimha Rao. Having already stepped down from the office of the
president  of  the Congress Party, he will find his  position  as
Leader  of  the  Congress  Parliamentary  Party  untenable  after
today's legal rebuffs - first the Delhi High Court's rejection of
his  plea for an anticipatory bail and later the charge-sheet  in
the St. Kitts forgery case.

That he becomes the first former Prime Minister to have to face a
charge-sheet   is   in  itself  not   without   grave   political
implications.  There was no official Congress reaction;  nor  any
Congress leader wanted to say anything adverse about him. At  the
same time there was no enthusiasm to speak up in his defence.  In
fact,  there  was a sense of sadness among the  Congress  leaders
that  Mr.  Narasimha  Rao should get  badly  embroiled  in  legal
entanglements.

After  Mr.  Rao stepped down as Congress president, much  of  the
anger  and  bitterness  towards him has waned.  But  there  is  a
realisation that he cannot escape paying a price for the  forces,
some  clearly  unwholesome, he helped unleash  in  the  political
system.

Most  Congress  leaders have convinced themselves that it  was  a
deliberate political strategy on the part of Mr. Narasimha Rao to
entangle  rivals like Mr. L. K. Advani, Mr. Arjun Singh  and  Mr.
Tiwari  in  the hawala case. That  case  generated  unprecedented
divisiveness and bitterness in and outside the Congress,  leaving
Mr.  Rao with few friends and little goodwill once he  failed  to
lead the party to victory in the Lok Sabha elections.

If nothing else, there will be pressure on Mr. Rao to follow  the
precedent  set by other political leaders charge-sheeted  in  the
hawala scandal. It would be recalled that Mr. Advani had resigned
his    Lok Sabha seat  in January this year after he was  charge-
sheeted  (along with Mr. Arjun Singh, Mr. Madhavrao Scindia,  Mr.
Balram Jakhar and others). Mr. Advani had said that he would  not
contest  the  Lok Sabha elections unless he was  cleared  of  the
"trumped up charges." Similarly, Mr. Sharad Yadav of the Janata
Dal  was forced to step down as the leader of the Janata  Dal  in
the Lok Sabha.

Subsequently,  the  Congress  itself  denied  nomination  to  the
"charge-sheeted" leaders like Mr. V. C. Shukla, Mr. Jhakar, Mr.
Scindia  and  Mr. Arvind Netam. The principle  invoked  was  that
anyone "charge-sheeted" ought to get himself/herself cleared of
the  legal entanglement before the party would run the risk of  a
political endorsement/association.

The "charge-sheet" principle was invoked by Mr. Narasimha Rao's
supporters  themselves last week after he was issued  summons  in
the  Lakhubhai Pathak case. A statement signed by  four  general-
secretaries (Messrs B. P. Maurya, Janardhana Poojary,  Madhavsinh
Solanki and R. K. Dhavan) had noted:  "the general feeling among
the Congress leaders is that the issuing of summons by itself  is
not a reason for the Congress president to take this drastic step
[of  relinquishing  the  office]. In a number  of  cases  persons
against  whom  charges  have  been  framed  in  the  courts   are
continuing in their posts."

The  charge-sheet has come now. And though at the  last  Congress
Working  Committee, the party leadership had assured him that  he
would not stand alone in his legal battles, that scenario  stands
changed  after the St. Kitts charge-sheet. Unless  Mr.  Narasimha
Rao  demonstrates  an hitherto unsuspected fighting  ability  and
personal  stamina, his political career can be said to have  come
to an abrupt end.

India: Urea scam: CBI may send team to Geneva

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 15, Col. c

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 25.

The  Central  Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is  giving  finishing
touches  to the requisite documents for pressing the  extradition
of  the  two top officials of the Turkish firm,  Karsan  Limited,
from Switzerland.

A  two-member CBI team had returned from Geneva about a week  ago
and  had taken up the exercise of preparing the documents  to  be
sent to the Swiss authorities.

According  to sources, the CBI may send its team to  Geneva  with
the  documents  seeking  extradition of  Karsan's  Chairman,  Mr.
Tuncay Alankus and its Executive Director, Mr. Cihan Karanci. The
duo  was arrested by the Interpol earlier this month.  They  were
stated to be still under detention in Geneva.

There is no extradition treaty between India and Switzerland  but
the  request  can  be made under  the  Swiss-British  Extradition
Treaty. The request has to reach the Swiss authorities within  30
days of the arrest of the two accused.

The  investigation  into the Rs. 133 crore urea  import  scam  is
likely to pick up and the CBI may succeed in its efforts to trace
the flow of funds from Karsan's account in Pictet Bank, Geneva.
The  Fertilizer  Ministry had refused to accept the  shipment  of
9006  tonnes of urea dispatched by Karsan as the  fertilizer  was
much below international standards. In the deal to supply 2  lakh
tonnes  of  urea to the National Fertilizer  Limited  (NFL),  the
Turkish company took the full advance of $37 million, but  failed
to supply the fertilizer by May as stated in the contract.

Asian tariffs impede growth: World Bank

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 14, Col. d

From Sridhar Krishnaswami

WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.

India  continued to reap substantial benefits from the trade  and
investment  liberalisation reforms undertaken after 1991 and  the
South Asian economies that grew by about 5.3 per cent in 1995  is
estimated  to grow around six per cent, according to  the  Annual
Report of the World Bank for 1996. Since 1991, the average export
growth  rate for the region has exceeded 10 per cent compared  to
an average of 5.6 per cent for the years 1981-1990,but the export
of  goods  and non-factor services represented less than  15  per
cent  of domestic output, well below the average  for  developing
countries.  "Although recent reforms have succeeded in  lowering
trade barriers, South Asian tariffs remain far higher than  those
in  other  regions.  As a result, they remain  an  impediment  to
growth because in conjunction with other trade restrictions, they
create distortions and can lead to resource misallocation,"  the
Annual Report observes.

The  regional  perspectives of the Bank for South Asia  reveal  a
mixture of the positive fallouts of the reform process that  have
put  in place as well as in some of the  persisting  difficulties
that  stand in the way of development either as a result  of  the
perceived  lack  of reforms in particular areas or in  other  on-
going  political and civil developments in specific nations.  The
Report,  in  talking about the conditions in Bangladesh  and  Sri
Lanka, makes the point that political difficulties in the case of
Bangladesh  and  in the continuation of the civil strife  in  Sri
lanka have contributed to dampening private sector dynamism  and,
thereby, restraining growth.

Reform process pays off

On  the positive side, the Annual Report takes note of  the  fact
that   regional  cooperation  had  received  a  boost  with   the
ratification  of a trade agreement by members of the  South  Asia
Association of Regional Cooperation, or SAARC. The agreement that
included bilateral concessions brought about cuts in tariff rates
ranging  from  10  to  100  per cent  in  more  than  220  items.
"Although  the trade impact is likely to be small given the  low
share of intra-regional trade, the SAARC countries have indicated
their  intention to initiate negotiations towards establishing  a
free trade area in the near future," the World Bank notes.
The  Bank Assessment has been that the reform process and  active
engagement  in the world economy by the South Asian  nations  are
now paying off in terms of higher foreign investment with private
capitals  accounting  for close to 50 per cent  of  the  resource
flows  to  the  region as opposed to 25 per  cent  in  1990.  The
aggregate  resource flows may have fallen in 1995 due to  decline
in  overall  portfolio  flows following the  devaluation  of  the
Mexican  peso  in December 1994,but they were still  much  higher
than  in 1993. Foreign Direct Investment reached a record U.S.  $
2.8  billions  and  although  India  was  the  largest  recipient
(receiving about U.S. $ 2 billions) other nations also shared  in
the increase.

The  countries of South Asia, the World Bank notes, also saw  the
growth  of the export earnings outpace the increase in debt  with
all  countries  improving the  debt-to-export  and  debt-to-gross
national  product  ratios. The economies of the region  were  the
only  group of developing countries not to have restructured  the
debt in the past decade and having incurred almost no arrears  to
external  debtors. "But maintaining sound economic  fundamentals
and  pushing  ahead with economic reforms are  essential  if  the
region  is to take full advantage of the enormous  potential  for
further  growth  in private capital flows to  the  region,"  the
World Bank has said.

Poor social indicators

The  incidence and depth of poverty may have declined  since  the
1980s, but the number of poor has increased. The recent estimate,
according to the World Bank, is that 43 per cent of the  region's
population  lives on incomes of less than U.S. $ 1 per  day;  and
that  South Asia, which accounts for 22 per cent of  the  world's
population,  accounted  for 40 per cent of the  world's  poor  as
well. Aside from the fact that this underscored the importance of
policies that raised rural incomes, the Bank argues that high and
sustained growth rate that takes place in an environment of sound
economic  management was essential for the reduction of  poverty.
"But growth is not by itself sufficient to reduce poverty. South
Asia's  social indicators are very poor. Average life  expectancy
at birth is sixty years, half the adult population is  illiterate
and  children  under  the  age of  five  experience  the  highest
mortality rate in the world... These regional averages,  however,
mask  considerable  diversity, both across countries as  well  as
within countries. Sri Lanka and some Indian States, for  example,
have  social  indicators  that  are  comparable  with  those   in
countries with a higher income per capita," the Bank says.
The  annual report makes the point that achieving  major  poverty
reduction  is  feasible;  but to attain  more  rapid  growth  and
integration in the world economy in the coming years, nations  in
South  Asia will face tough policy challenges that would  include
addressing  the  deficiencies  in  social  areas,  infrastructure
bottlenecks,  reducing the still excessive trade  and  investment
barriers  and  extending  the scope of  competition  in  domestic
factor  and  product  markets. "The Bank  continues  to  support
policies   that   promote  sustainable  growth,   develop   human
resources, extend the benefits to currently disadvantaged  groups
(such as women), and overcome obstacles to the sustainability  of
growth,  particularly  in the environmental  and  human  resource
areas. The current operational strategy in the region  emphasises
ways   to   achieve  these   objectives   through   participatory
approaches,   decentralisation,  increased  involvement  by   the
private sector and a sharper client focus," the Report adds.
New action plan

On  the role of the private sector, the World Bank has taken  the
position  that  in  South Asia, severe  absorptive  capacity  and
implementation  deficiencies  coupled with  financial  restraints
have resulted in chronic underinvestment in infrastructure  where
the  public sector alone did not have the resources to  meet  the
needs  -  as, for instance, in the lack of available  finance  on
terms  commensurate with the typical long gestation  and  revenue
earning  capacity  of infrastructure projects.  "In  India,  for
example,  the  development of a long term  domestic  debt  market
requires a number of significant policy reforms in the  financial
sector,   particularly  as  regards  regulations  applicable   to
contractual  savings institutions. While such a reform  programme
is being formulated and until its key elements are implemented so
that  a  well-functioning  domestic  long-term  debt  market  can
emerge, domestic financial institutions have to play a major role
in  supporting private investment in infrastructure," the  World
Bank notes.

The Report, at a broader level, has to be seen in the context  of
the  global  changes that are currently taking place and  in  the
backdrop of the recent trends that would include the rapid growth
of  private  investments  and capital  availability  and  in  the
levelling   off  or  even  diminishing   official   developmental
assistance.  For instance, the total private flows to  the  major
emerging market economies totalled some U.S. $ 225 billions while
the official flows amounted to only U.S. $ 14 billions. In  terms
of  region,  the  Asia  Pacific accounted for  some  U.S.  $  123
billions of private financial flows, and U.S. $ 10.4 billions  in
official   flows  from  the  major  financial  agencies.   Senior
officials  of the World Bank take the position that the  flow  of
private investment is not to be taken as some kind of a `threat'.
For one thing the argument has been that private investment flows
are  directed  by  specificity  and  sector  dominated;  and  for
another,  the  point  is  being made that  the  flow  of  private
investment opens different arenas to the World Bank.

One of the critical aspects of this year's annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund is in developing a
comprehensive strategy to meet the needs of the heavily  indebted
poor countries. Such a plan of action is said to be on the `brink
of  a  breakthrough', although serious questions  remain  on  the
extent  to which the industrialised world is willing to go  along
with finding additional resources to meet the challenge.
India returns more

PTI reports:

India  returned  to the World Bank $ 723 millions  more  than  it
received  from  the institution in fiscal 1996, ending  June  30,
thanks to repayments and interest on past loans.

The  Annual Report of the Bank shows that in fiscal  1996,  India
had undisbursed commitments of $ 9.43 billions. During the  year,
the  Bank  made  new  commitments  of  $  2.978  billions   while
disbursements   amounted  to  $  1.309  billions.  Against   that
disbursement,  India paid the Bank $ 1.149 billions as  repayment
and  $  884  millions  as interest, leaving  the  country  $  723
millions in the red.

India: Cauvery: Karnataka denies understanding

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 14, Col. c

From Our Special Correspondent

BANGALORE, Sept. 26.

The  Karnataka Major Irrigation Minister, Mr. K. N.  Nage  Gowda,
clarified  on Thursday that no understanding was reached  on  any
contentious  issue relating to the Cauvery water  dispute  during
the talks between the Governments of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
Mr.  Nage  Gowda told presspersons that what had  transpired  was
only loud thinking. It was not correct to say that the States had
agreed to build an additional water gauging centre at Biligundlu,
where  the  Central Water Commission-manned  gauging  centre  was
located.

Mr. Nage Gowda was endorsing the view expressed by the Tamil Nadu
PWD Minister, Mr. Durai Murugan, in Madras on Wednesday.
The  Minister  said  there  was  also  no  understanding  on  not
extending  the area under irrigation in the Cauvery  basin.  This
issue  was linked to the quantum of water that was to  be  shared
between the two States, which had not been agreed upon. Mr.  Nage
Gowda,  who convened a press conference in the morning,  said  he
had spoken to both the Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr. J. H. Patel,
and  Mr. Durai Murugan. The Chief Minister had told him over  the
phone  that  he did not say that both the States had come  to  an
understanding  on  setting  up an additional  gauging  centre  at
Biligundlu to monitor the water inflow.

He clarified that the Tamil Nadu had stuck to its stand that  the
Mettur  reservoir was the reference point and it  had  maintained
that  even  the Cauvery Tribunal had endorsed it.  The  Karnataka
Government  had  suggested  that  a  modern  gauging  centre   be
established at Biligundlu on the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border.
Expressing   the  Government's  resentment  over   the   reported
statement  of the Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Minister that  Andhra
Pradesh  was not getting an adequate quantity of water  from  the
Tungabhadra  dam, Mr. Nage Gowda said the release of  water  from
that dam was monitored by the Tungabhadra Board, which was headed
by  the  Chairman  of the Central  Water  Commission.  The  State
Governments  of  Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh had no say  on  the
issue. Farmers in Karnataka had not tapped water meant for Andhra
Pradesh.  The Tungabhadra Board had vindicated Karnataka's  stand
in  its  recent  letter. Tungabhadra water was  being  shared  by
Karnataka  and  Andhra  Pradesh on the  basis  of  an  agreement.
Karnataka  was getting two-thirds of the water and the  rest  was
being  used  by  Andhra Pradesh. Describing the  remarks  of  his
Andhra  Pradesh counterpart as unfortunate, Mr. Nage  Gowda  said
such  `unverified'  and `unwarranted' statements would  harm  the
cordial  relations between the two States. If the Andhra  Pradesh
Government had complaints, it could raise them at the Tungabhadra
Board meeting scheduled for October 15.

He  termed as baseless the allegation of the Mysore  BJP  member,
Mr.  Ramdas, that the Prime Minister, Mr. H. D. Deve  Gowda,  had
settled contractors' bills relating to the Bagur-Navile tunnel of
the  Hemavathy  project, worth Rs. 1.19 crores, two  days  before
resigning  as Chief Minister. He maintained that these bills  had
not been settled for the last four to five years.

India: EC looking into BJP complaints against PM

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The Election Commission is looking into complaints received  from
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against the Prime Minister,  Mr.
H.  D.  Deve Gowda, charging him of violating the model  code  of
conduct  during  his  campaign for  the  Uttar  Pradesh  Assembly
elections.

The BJP's complaints relate to Mr. Gowda's reported announcements
that  his  Government was considering reservation  for  women  in
Central  Government jobs and also for extending  the  reservation
bracket to poor among the forward castes. Mr. Gowda had  promised
these in the course of his election meetings in U.P.

The Commission has called for reports from the Cabinet Secretary,
according  to  a  spokesman  of  the  Election  Commission.   The
spokesman  added  that  the Election Commission  has  received  a
report  from  the  Doordarshan and that a full  report  from  the
Cabinet  Secretary  was expected by this week end.  The  Election
Commission will take up the matter for a final verdict soon after
receiving the report, the spokesman added.

The  Commission  had  also taken up a  proposal  from  the  Uttar
Pradesh Government to give extension to one of its officers,  Mr.
Surendra  Mohan, who is due to superannuate on September  30.  It
was  decided  that  such an extension was not in  order  and  the
decision was conveyed to the Government.

In  another  instance of the  Commission's  intervention  towards
enforcing  the  model code, the Commission has  conveyed  to  the
Jammu  and  Kashmir Chief Secretary stating that a  September  23
decision to set up a Directorate of Tourism was not in order  and
that such a decision must be left to the elected State Government
that is expected to be in place within the coming fortnight.

A COALITION GOVERNMENT IS THE LIKELIEST OUTCOME

India has had ten general elections since it became independent in
1947. Four of them resulted in a change of government, but none
affected the basic continuity of its policies. So Indians should be
able to take the eleventh election -- likely to be held in April -- in
their stride. But there is an almost palpable nervousness in political
circles in New Delhi, for all the available evidence suggests that no
party will win the 273 seats needed to gain a majority in parliament.
This election, therefore, is likely to be followed by a period of
haggling between parties, from which a coalition may eventually emerge.

Congress, which has ruled India for all but three and a half of the
past 48 years, is no stranger to electoral setbacks. In 1989, under
Rajiv Gandhi, it gained only 198 seats. In the last elections it
improved its tally to 219 (though subsequently it managed to increase
its strength). In 1977, after Mrs Indira Gandhi had declared an
Emergency and jailed thousands of her opponents, the Congress won only
153 seats. But on all these occasions, the party retained its dominance
of Indian politics, a dominance inherited from 75 years of leading the
struggle for independence. When coalitions of other parties formed the
government, the public saw them as temporary occupants for they
contained parties who had united only to oust Congress from power.
Congress therefore remained the dominant force and continued to set the
agenda for the country.

This long era is drawing to a close. The reason why the next election
may bring it to an end lies in India's first-past-the-post system of
voting which systematically magnifies the proportion of seats gained by
the largest party in relation to its votes and diminishes the share of
seats of smaller parties. Congress has never secured an absolute
majority of the national vote. The closest it came to doing so was in
1984 when Mrs Gandhi's assassination generated a huge wave of sympathy
for the party and gave it 49.1 per cent of the vote. On other occasions
the Congress has received between 36.5 per cent (1977) and 47.8 per
cent (1957). However, this has usually been sufficient to give the
party a comfortable majority in parliament.

The Congress party could easily have lost its dominance as far back as
in 1984. In a string of 23 by-elections spread across the country in
May of that year, it received less than 37 per cent of the vote. But
then Mrs Gandhi was assassinated with the consequences mentioned above.
However, by 1989, when elections became due again, the party's vote had
dropped to 37.8 per cent once more.

Exactly the same thing happened in 1991, when Rajiv Gandhi was
assassinated in the middle of the elections after two-fifths of the
constituencies had gone to the polls. An analysis of the voting before
and after the event shows that Congress gained around 5.5 per cent of
the vote out of sympathy. This gave it 219 seats and over 38 per cent
of the vote. But that wave too has spent itself. Various by-elections
and, less ambiguously, the Congress' loss, between December 1994 and
March 1995 of state elections in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
Maharashtra, which had been its strongholds for the past four decades,
have shown that even holding 32 per cent of the vote will not be easy.

In a proportional representation system 32 per cent of the vote would
have given it around 180-185 seats -- or just enough to be sure of
emerging as the dominant partner in a future coalition government. But
under the first-past-the-post system, even this figures seems beyond
its reach. The voting system, which has so far worked in favour of the
Congress, is likely to turn against it. The reason is that, while all
of Congress's rivals are much smaller than it is, their vote is not
spread evenly through the country but is concentrated in small parts of
it. Like inkdots on blotting paper, these local concentrations of the
non-Congress vote have now spread till they cover most of the country.
In most areas, therefore, the Congress is in imminent danger of being
reduced to the second position, and in one, UP, which elects one-fifth
of the parliament, it has already been pushed down to third place.

Should this happen throughout the country, it is even possible that the
Congress could end with not even a hundred seats. But such a debacle is
unlikely. In two or three states where it fared poorly in 1991, the
political pendulum will have swung in its favour and this will give it
a majority of the seats. Judging by recent state election results the
states most likely to swing towards Congress are Orissa in the east,
Madhya Pradesh in central India, and the tiny Himalayan state of
Himachal Pradesh. The Congress is also expected to make significant
gains in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

It is also possible that a significant number of people will vote
differently in the national election from the way they did at the state
level. These are middle class voters who generally tend to make up
their minds at the last minute, and they may chose stability and
continued economic reform.

If all these factors work in favour of the Congress, it may win around
160 seats. With its long term ally, the All India Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam, a Tamil nationalist party from Tamil Nadu, the Congress could
command a stable 180 seats in parliament. While this would not be
sufficient for it to rule alone, it would virtually ensure that the
next coalition is led by it.

This is not, of course, a view shared by the Congress's main rival, the
Hindu-revivalist BJP. A recent internal review of its poll prospects by
the party is supposed to have shown that the party expects to win no
less than 260 seats (against the 119 that it has at present) and to
form the next government with the help of smaller groups that will
gravitate to it in quest of power. But this estimate flatters the BJP
unduly. More than nine-tenths of its support is concentrated in five
large and two mini-states: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh. This concentration
enabled it to get 23 per cent of the seats in parliament with 21 per
cent of the vote in 1991, but it will effectively prevent it from
adding many more seats to its tally in 1996. To do so it must break
into new areas with enough votes to get past the post first. But a
study of past elections shows that while the party has succeeded in
deepening its hold, it has not succeeded in broadening it. In 1989,
when it put up 86 candidates outside its traditional strongholds, 85 of
them lost their deposit. The most it can hope for in 1996 is to capture
a few more marginal urban constituencies, where the lower middle class,
from which it draws most of its support, predominates.

Between the two of them therefore the two major contenders are not
likely to capture more than 300 seats in parliament. To whom will the
remaining seats go? The short answer is that two states, West Bengal
and Kerala, are dominated by the Communists (now the Left Front) while
another three states, Bihar, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are likely to
stay with the Janata Dal and its electoral ally, the Telugu Desam. All
these parties are part of a loose coalition called the National Front-
Left Front (NF-LF) which succeeded in getting 118 seats in the 1991
parliament. There is every likelihood that this coalition, despite its
inchoateness, will profit from the general disenchantment with Congress
and the unwillingness of large segment of the population to support the
BJP. It could end in a close third place with about 110-120 seats.

Since neither the Congress nor the NF-LF is prepared to deal with the
BJP, if the former (with the AIADMK) does manage to nose ahead with 160
or so seats, a coalition between it and the Left Front, with all or
part of the NF is a likely outcome. Such a government will undoubtedly
carry on the reform policies of the Rao government. But the weakening
of the centre that coalition politics entails, will almost certainly
cause a shift in the relative roles of the centre and states. Till now
it has been the centre that has made the running in reform. After the
next election the initiative will pass to the states, and the centre
will be left to hold the ring. This could mean that its role will be no
more than to pass enabling legislation that facilitates the states'
search for private capital to finance its projects.

However, if the Congress collapses and fails to get more than a hundred
seats, the lead would pass to the BJP. Very likely the Congress would
split and a part of it would join the BJP in its quest for a share of
power. India would then enter, abruptly, a new era of two-party
politics. For economic reforms this would be a bad outcome, for the BJP
is a xenophobic party. While its top leaders say they welcome foreign
investment in hi-tech and infrastructure areas, they have still to
realise that foreign investors have requirements of their own, and that
cutting off Kentucky Fried Chicken could also cut off IBM and Sony.

ECONOMY:  POWER SHORTAGES TAKE THEIR TOLL

In recent weeks, both the finance minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, and the
commerce minister, Mr P.Chidambaram, have stressed repeatedly that the
fundamentals of the economy are strong and there is no cause for worry
about its future. They are both right and wrong. The fundamentals are
strong: the gross domestic product grew by 6 per cent in 1994-95; the
rate of inflation has fallen sharply from over 10 per cent recorded at
the beginning of the year to below 7 per cent; the growth of exports
has been strong, and the trade deficit this year is not likely to
exceed $4.5bn (1.3 per cent of GDP).

But the strong fundamentals today are no guarantee that they will
remain so in the coming months. A close look at the most recent
statistics suggests that the economy is weakening and could weaken
further. Frequent revisions of the official statistics make all
estimates of growth somewhat tentative, but the growth in industrial
production, which was nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter of this
year, fell to 8.6 per cent in July. Preliminary estimates, based on
figures for around half of all industry suggest that there have been
further falls during August and September. In the last of these months
the index for 24 industry groups seems to have risen by a bare 4 per
cent.

Exports have been growing at 24.5 per cent in the first half of 1995-
96, but a closer look at the month-by-month data shows that this too
has been declining -- from 33 per cent in July to 20 and 19 per cent in
August and September, and 12 per cent in October. Fortunately, imports
too have declined, and even more sharply, so that the trade deficit can
be financed.

Inflation has come down, partly as a result of tight monetary policy,
and partly because of the almost total halt of foreign portfolio
investment and other capital inflows. From an average of $1bn a month
between October 1993 and November 1994, these fell to an average of
$100m in January to October 1995, and to a mere $39m in November. There
has been a corresponding fall in the growth of money supply in the
economy. By contrast the government's spending remains buoyant. A
recent study by the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy
has estimated that instead of coming down to 5.5 per cent of GDP this
year, the centre's fiscal deficit could climb to 6.9 per cent against
the 6.7 per cent recorded last year. This is probably a far too
pessimistic a forecast, but there is no doubt that the high fiscal
deficit remains a source of future inflation.

The reasons for the slowdown, both in industrial growth and exports,
are not difficult to fathom. Thanks to a less than optimal south-west,
and a poor north-east monsoon, the country is now in the grip of a
severe power crisis. The output of hydroelectric power slumped by 19
per cent in July to September over the same period of 1994. The poor
north-east monsoon ensures that this shortage will worsen in the coming
months. There are power shortages everywhere, but the southern and
western states in particular are reeling under the severest power cuts
in almost a decade. These cuts have directly affected manufacturing
industries, and that in turn has begun to affect exports.

Apart from this, the combination of a lax fiscal policy and a tight
monetary policy has raised interest rates to very high levels. This is
helping to slow down the economy. Another factor is the anxiety among
investors, both Indian and foreign, over the political outlook. The
worry is not just the normal one that precedes a general election, but
has to do with the probability that this election may bring into power
a government that may not have the strength to complete the reform
programme. This is causing some loss of confidence, whose symptoms are
the fall in the value of the rupee, the inability of the stockmarket to
recover and feverish speculation in real estate.

DABHOL:  MAHARASHTRA FINALLY APPROVES ENRON PROJECT

After months of muscle flexing and dithering the Maharashtra government
has finally cleared Enron's power project at Dabhol. At the same time
the state government also cleared two other power projects in the
state, Reliance's 410 MW gas based plant at Patalganga and the Nippon
Denro Ispat-led consortium's 1082 MW coal-based plant at Bhadrawati.
The three projects will add a total of nearly 5,000 MW of installed
power generating capacity in the state.

While the clearance of the Dabhol project has ostensibly led to lower
capital costs reflected in a lower cost per unit of electricity, the
Maharashtra chief minister Manohar Joshi did not release all the
details of the renotiated deal. Under the revised terms offered by the
government and accepted in principle by Enron, the 695 MW first phase
and the 1390 MW second phase have been combined and total cost reduced
by Rs10.56bn to Rs80.04bn. Enron has also been permitted to hive off
its Rs15.8bn regassification plant into a separate company, a step
whose implications are not yet clear.

The plant will now be operated on naptha instead on LNG and the cost of
power has been reduced from around Rs2.10 per kWh for the first phase
to Rs1.86 per kWh for both the phases. The annual escalation of around
4 per cent has also been disallowed and Enron will supply power at the
same dollar rate for 17 years. However, costs have been calculated at
Rs32 to the dollar while the rupee is currently trading at over Rs35 to
the dollar and may decline further.

In another important decision the Maharashtra State Electricity Board
will now hold 30 per cent of the total equity in Enron's Dabhol project
for Rs5.78bn. Equipment for the second phase will now not necessarily
be bought from Enron's partners General Electric and Bechtel but will
be on open tender for which Indian companies can also bid.

Manohar Joshi claimed a savings of Rs250bn for the state over the
lifespan of the project but in the absence of details this is difficult
to verify. While welcoming the decision, Kenneth Lay, CEO of Enron
Corporation, said, "We are willing to consider recommendations that
provide for a mutually satisfactory project".

The ruling Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party coalition in Maharashtra
will try to present the deal it has secured from Enron as a victory,
but it is no secret that a wing of the BJP is unhappy about the
outcome.

NARASIMHA RAO NAMES THE MONTH

The elections to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) will be
in April. Prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao stated this on January 6,
but declined to specify the dates. He also said that parliament will
meet once again in February to approve a vote-on-account for the year,
the regular Union budget being postponed until after a new government
settles in. The dates for the elections are fixed by the election
commission and the government in consultation with each other. Earlier,
the election commission had announced that the elections would be held
in either February or April, the month of March being unsuitable
because it coincides with the sowing season and university
examinations.

VIOLENCE IS EXPECTED DURING THE ELECTIONS

The airdropping of arms into a country is a worrisome development in
the best of times. When it comes just before a general election, there
is even greater cause for alarm. The discovery last month that small
arms, including several hundred AK47 rifles, were clandestinely dropped
near an abandoned airfield at Purulia in West Bengal by foreign
mercenaries has added a new element of uncertainty to the polls. Though
there is no clear indication so far whom the arms were meant for,
speculation has centred around a Maoist faction in Bihar, a
paramilitary Hindu religious organisation, or an attempt by a foreign
country to instigate violence during the elections.

Every successive election since the 1970s has witnessed increasing
violence in the form of intimidating voters or "capturing" polling
booths by musclemen to stuff ballot boxes. In the past two years,
elections have been better conducted because of the reforming zeal of
chief election commissioner T.N. Seshan. Now, the near certainty of a
hung parliament may encourage more violence. The mysterious arms drop
at Purulia has added a nasty edge to that possibility.

TWO STATES DISPUTE THE SHARE OF A SINGLE RIVER

In the past the Indian subcontinent has witnessed wars over the use of
river waters. More recently, though India has had disputes over the
sharing of river waters with three of it neighbours -- Pakistan, Nepal
and Bangladesh -- they have either been satisfactorily resolved or admit
of a possible solution. Within the country, the sharing of river waters
has led to conflict between neighbouring states through which a river
passes. When conflicting positions could not be resolved by the
concerned states, a tribunal has been set up to adjudicate and award
the sharing of waters.

Of the five such cases referred to tribunals, four (Narmada, Krishna
and Godavari in the Deccan, and Ravi and Beas in the north) have been
sorted out. The fifth, the sharing of the waters of the Cauvery, has
once again become a bone of contention between Karnataka and Tamil
Nadu, the two states which depend most heavily on its waters. The
Cauvery is one of the most intensively used rivers in the world with
some 92 per cent of its waters being used for irrigation by a system of
dams and canals. The roots of the century-old dispute lie in the fact
that, while Tamil Nadu has used most of the waters, Karnataka feels the
irrigation potential in the state was not allowed to be properly
developed by the British.

Karnataka wants a greater share of the waters and has been building up
its irrigation potential which has led to a reduction in the existing
supply to Tamil Nadu. The matter is so linked to the prosperity and
even survival of farmers in the two states that neither can see the
other's point of view. Coming as it does before the general election,
there were fears that passions may be aroused on both sides leading to
street violence as happened in 1991.

Karnataka, through which the upper reaches of the river and its
tributaries pass, was asked by the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal to
release 205 tmc ft (thousand million cubic feet) of water to Tamil Nadu
annually but disputed this on every count. This year matters got worse
since the north-east monsoon (October to January) which normally gives
over half the annual rain to Tamil Nadu, failed. Over 1.3 million acres
of paddy were in danger of being lost. Tamil Nadu approached the
Supreme Court to order Karnataka to release 11 tmc ft of water
immediately to save the crop. The court passed on the buck to prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao asking him to ask the states to come to a
settlement, failing which he should do what he thought was best.

Rao appointed a committee of experts and decided that Karnataka must
release 6 tmc ft at once. Karnataka chief minister Deve Gowda agreed
reluctantly but there was an immediate backlash of anger in the state.
Tempers also ran high in Tamil Nadu and Rao was put in the sticky
position of mediating between two warring sides on the eve of an
important general election. If violence had broken out the Congress
party's prospects would have been affected in both states. With tempers
now having cooled, Rao can have the satisfaction of having made the
best of a bad job.

STOCKMARKET:  THE MONETARY BRAKES ARE STILL ON

In terms of value, Indian shares are currently attractive. For the long-
term investor, the market should be bought. But in the short-term there
are some impediments to the start of a bull market. For one thing,
money is very tight. This is increasingly threatening to stifle
economic growth. For another, the manner in which stockmarket reforms
are being conducted does not inspire confidence in investors.

Money is tight because the government has taken the virtuous path of
borrowing to finance its deficit instead of monetising it as it used to
do. This has kept inflation under check, but it is squeezing the
private sector. Many companies are finding it difficult to get money,
even at high cost. Financially sound companies are having to pay
interest rates at over 21 per cent. Some of them had raised money
through equity issues in India and abroad when their shares were in
demand; foolishly, many of them invested the proceeds in equities or
real estate. Companies are therefore short of money and many projects
are getting delayed. Even where they had received commitments to borrow
funds from domestic financial institutions (DFIs), they are finding the
going tough. DFIs themselves are starved for funds and are delaying
disbursements of loans.

The DFIs are scrambling to raise money primarily through the debt
route. ICICI, for example, managed to raise about Rs7bn recently,
through a five year bond, but had to pay a coupon rate of 16 per cent
despite the instrument being rated triple-A. That amount would suffice
for less than two months of its loan sanctions, after which it will
need to float another issue. All other DFIs are simultaneously planning
issues and the total works out at Rs50bn. The main subscribers are
provident funds, but their additional annual inflow is only Rs6bn.

The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has
issued a warning that unless the monetary situation is eased, the
economy will slow down. Recently the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has
helped a little by cutting CRR, in effect pumping some Rs25bn into the
system.

The second worry is the slow pace of stockmarket reforms. All the
systemic problems relating to settlement and delivery which plague the
Indian capital market system have their root in the absence of a
central depository. The trading systems have been largely modernised,
with the introduction of screen-based trading. However, post settlement
delays in registration of shares deter foreign investment. In a report
by James Capel entitled "Emerging markets investment strategies -- Q4
1995", the Indian market is given neutral weightage, despite scoring
high on valuation, primarily because of poor liquidity of shares.
Annual traded volume (on the assumption of 250 days trading) represents
only 8 per cent of market capitalisation. Compare that with the leader,
Taiwan, which stands at 194 per cent, or South Korea (59 per cent).

The government had, through an ordinance, introduced legislation paving
the way for a central depository. Unfortunately, the bill never got
passed in the upper house of parliament. It is to be re-promulgated. If
it is not approved before the current parliament is dissolved, it will
mean a six month wait.

Sebi, the regulatory body, seems incapable of enforcing discipline. It
recently suspended the largest merchant banker, SBI Capital Markets,
for its role as lead manager to the controversial MS Shoes issue -- it
did not prevent misleading TV advertisements from appearing. SBI
Capital Markets has refused to accept Sebi's verdict and promises to
appeal, right up to the Supreme Court if necessary. It knows that
judicial delays make a mockery of any disciplinary action.

In another episode, Sebi declared itself unable to prevent another
merchant banker, which had defaulted on an underwriting commitment,
from making a public issue. Sebi is also unable to take quick action
against companies consistently delaying transfer of shares. Though it
has instituted legal proceedings against five companies, the Indian
legal system is not capable of delivering justice quickly.

As long as the capital market system is unable to cope with investment
needs of millions of individual investors, it is inevitable that the
mutual fund industry will grow. The industry had recently been
restricted to the public sector, mainly the banks and the UTI. Absence
of competition has bred complacency, and returns have been inadequate.

Now Sebi has issued guidelines for the mutual fund industry. They spell
out things such as the basis for computation of net asset values. More
importantly, they seek to link fees payable to asset management
companies to the performance of the funds. It is imperative that the
mutual fund industry grows in order to fill the vacuum left by the
reduced role of the UTI.

The UTI has been under a cloud recently. In September 1994, it had
bought shares of Reliance Industries as a price of Rs385 per share, in
a private placement deal worth Rs7bn. The share now quotes at around
Rs200, entailing not only a sizeable monetary loss for UTI, but more
importantly, a loss of investor confidence. More recently, it has been
embroiled in the Reliance switching of shares controversy, although it
has had the shares replaced subsequently.

UTI's future is important for the stockmarket because it controls funds
totalling some Rs650bn. Its largest scheme, the US '64 scheme, is an
open ended one, in which it is largely exposed to the corporate sector.
If, because of the tight money position faced by the companies, they
make redemption calls en masse, the resultant selling by UTI would hurt
the equity market.

On a positive note, the figures for the seven months to October reveal
a healthy trend in many sectors where the market is well represented.
Production of cement is up 9.7 per cent, of saleable steel 10.3 per
cent, and the auto sector is doing well with a 23.6 per cent increase
in production of cars and 32.3 per cent in commercial vehicles.

The boom in the auto sector is riding on the back of easier credit
availability from auto finance companies. Kotak Mahindra Finance (KMFL)
has cut a good deal with Ford Motor Company, with which it has entered
into two separate joint ventures. One will be to finance vehicles which
Ford will produce in India. The equity will be held by Ford (55 per
cent), KMFL (35 per cent) and Mahindra and Mahindra (10 per cent),
Ford's partner.

The more interesting deal is the other JV, in which KMFL will hive off
its existing (non-Ford) car financing business. In this, Ford will hold
a 40 per cent stake, bringing in Rs1.4bn, whilst KMFL will hold the
balance, bringing in Rs6m. Over the next eight years, Ford will
increase its commitment to Rs5bn, as will KMFL proportionately, leaving
the ratio the same. The deal makes KMFL a good share to pick up. KMFL
will also receive Rs4bn as royalty for Ford over the next ten years.

In other corporate developments of interest, Yogi Deveshwar has taken
over as Chairman of ITC, India's largest tobacco company, despite the
objections of BAT, the largest single holder with a 31 per cent stake.
Devashwar's appointment was made possible with the backing of
government-controlled financial institutions, holding 37 per cent. He
has landed into a hot seat. At the start of the new year, the
government has re-opened an excise dispute and has claimed Rs8bn as
penalty for past excise defaults. The share price dipped from Rs242 to
Rs229 on release of the news, but quickly firmed up to end the
fortnight at Rs233, on reports that BAT had set aside $60m to acquire
an additional 6 per cent stake in the company (see page 15).

The BSE is to reintroduce a forward trading mechanism from January 15.
The market is hoping that this will bring back investors. But with
interest rates at such high level, forward trading will be expensive.

BUSINESS:  NEPC GOES INTO BATTLE FOR MODILUFT

Five years ago, the Madras-based NEPC group was practically unknown. It
was a new player in a new arena -- wind energy. And though the Khemkas,
who own the group, were thinking big even then, most corporate
observers were prone to dismiss their grand plans as just so much wind.

No longer. Last month, NEPC made an open offer for the Rs4bn (expected
1995-96 turnover) ModiLuft. With the company's promoter S.K. Modi not
only marshalling his defences but also taking the battle to the
opposition camp by threatening a suit claiming Rs25bn in damages, this
is a battle that has placed the Khemkas firmly on the front pages of
the financial press.

They have been there before. NEPC already has a successful airline --
NEPC Airlines -- a division of flagship NEPC-Micon. Earlier last year,
the company engineered a successful takeover of Damania Airways.
Initially billed as a management takeover, the Khemkas were later
forced to make an open offer to ordinary Damania shareholders by the
Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Along the way, NEPC also
picked up the Damania family holding in the company.

With the acquisition of Damania, the NEPC-Damania combine became the
largest private sector operator in the aviation sector. The ModiLuft
deal, if it comes through, should make this position unassailable. The
only big rival in the business -- East West -- is in no position to give
chase.  The company is still recovering from the shock of what is
alleged to be a gangland killing. Recently, its CEO, T. Wahid was shot
dead on the streets of Bombay while returning from work.

But ModiLuft is not going to fall in the Khemkas' bag without a battle.
The Khemkas had initially offered to take over 47.32 per cent of
ModiLuft's equity at a price of Rs29 per share. Curiously, the offer
was for exactly 47.32 per cent; the Khemkas weren't interested in a
lesser stake. Sebi is now looking into the legality of the offer which
S.K. Modi says is against the takeover code.

Besides, says Modi, he and his family control 60 per cent of ModiLuft's
equity. So the question of the Khemkas picking up 47 per cent does not
arise. NEPC chief Ravi Prakash Khemka, on the other hand, disputes
Modi's ownership figures. He claims to have done his homework and the
47.32 per cent figure has been carefully calculated: he is aware of the
ownership pattern and is confident of getting that much. According to
Sebi's norms, ModiLuft will have to reveal its shareholders list by the
end of January and the truth will out only then.

But some of the Khemka calculations have already gone awry. The
ModiLuft shares have spiralled past Rs29 (they were much lower when the
offer was announced) and the Khemkas are planning to raise their bid to
Rs35. This will mean an additional Rs180m to pick up the stake; at Rs29
the deal would have cost Rs870m. Khemka had initially suggested that
some large holders (including some foreign institutional investors)
were going to unload their holdings in his favour. But that does not
seem to be working out. Besides, NEPC has had its share of abortive
takeovers, particularly in the aviation arena. Last year, the promoters
of Sahara, a rival private airline, accused the Khemkas of slanting
takeover stories in the press. The Khemkas, however, explained that it
was only some sharing of facilities that was being discussed and the
media had put two and two together to make five. Later there was talk
of NEPC taking over two regional airlines -- UP Air and Gujarat Airways.
But these apparently didn't go through because of a change in the state
government.

But this time the Khemkas seem confident. Some critics, Modi amongst
them, suggest that the open offer is nothing more than a ploy designed
principally to scupper ModiLuft's expansion plans. ModiLuft has offered
its collaborator Lufthansa a 40 per cent stake and Khemka had sent
feelers to Modi that this holding be offered to NEPC instead. The
swadeshi card has also been dragged out in this connection; note that
the Singapore Airlines-Tata joint venture has proved stillborn because
there are many who feel that foreign airlines should not be given
significant holdings in the Indian aviation sector. Now it will be all
the more difficult for the government to approve Lufthansa's taking up
a 40 per cent stake in ModiLuft. Which means, in sum, that the Khemkas
have hamstrung what could potentially have been a major competitor.

But if Modi does decide to sell, do the Khemkas have the wherewithal to
buy him out? On the face of it, yes. The NEPC group is extremely cash
rich. The current value of the shares held by the Khemka family in
group companies is over Rs3bn and finding the Rs1bn or so required to
buy 47 per cent of ModiLuft should not be a major problem. Ravi Prakash
Khemka is, in fact, planning to fund the acquisition with his personal
money without taking recourse to his group companies.

But the group companies can well put up the funds if necessary. They
are all in fine fettle. NEPC-Micon (which has a tie-up with Micon of
Denmark) is a leading producer of electricity from windpower with a
marketshare of 80 per cent. NEPC Agro Foods, which was promoted in
1991, has established its Trupti brandname which is used for a wide
range of products from mineral water to basmati rice, packaged wheat
flour and spices. The group also has a presence in textiles with NEPC
Textiles (a textile unit in Coimbatore taken over in 1993) and paper
with NEPC Paper & Board (a paper mill in Muzzafarnagar, Uttar Pradesh,
acquired in 1994). And it is now entering the cement business by
acquiring the "sick" South India Cement in Karnataka at a cost of
Rs145m. The group has also gone into media with its own satellite
channel.

The Doubting Thomases, however, see in the Khemka saga many
similarities with that of takeover tycoon P. Rajarathinam who has
fallen upon hard times, with creditors baying for his blood and his
empire under siege. Both came out of the blue, both are known to be
close to a particular Tamil Nadu politician and both have a habit of
venturing into unrelated takeovers. Khemka has another cross to bear:
his younger brother Sashi Prakash has accused him of violating the
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, forging share certificates and much
more. As is evident from Manu Chhabria's spat with his brother Kishore,
family squabbles often result in bringing high fliers down to earth.
Will Ravi Prakash Khemka prove the exception?

BUSINESS:  HOW RELIANCE LOST ITS HALO WITH INDIAN INVESTORS

Attack is not always the best form of defence. Reliance Industries Ltd
(RIL), which took umbrage at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) suspending
its scrip for three days for a minor peccadillo, should attest to that
by now. By threatening to delist itself from the BSE and move to the
National Stock Exchange (NSE) and by sending a legal notice to a
financial daily investigating the matter seeking damages of Rs20bn, RIL
ensured just the reverse of what it wanted.

RIL is still listed on the BSE. But the company and its suspect deals
are being investigated by the Securities & Exchange Board of India
(Sebi), the department of company affairs (DCA), the income-tax
department and the BSE. The press has now passed the baton to the
investigative authorities, so there are no daily exposes. But RIL
clearly has its back to the wall. Opposition MPs have demanded the
arrest of Dhirubhai Ambani; banks, financial institutions and insurance
companies have been asked by the government to verify their portfolios
(though RIL has not been named, this instruction is clearly targeted at
the company); and the initial sympathy for the Ambanis has been
replaced by growing concern, confusion and disbelief at their
manoeuvres. A public familiar only with ordinary equity and preference
shares has learned some new categories. Consider:

Duplicate shares: This is where it all started. One Rajul Vasa,
Dhirubhai Ambani's physiotherapist, wrote to the company claiming that
she had lost 26,650 RIL shares. She was issued duplicate shares which
she proceeded to sell. Earlier, however, she had sold her original
shares, and at the time when the duplicates were being issued, these
were with RIL's registrars -- Reliance Consultancy Services (RCS).
Reliance made good the loss of Rs10.6m and thought it was a closed
chapter. The BSE, however, decided to suspend it on this ground. RIL's
explanation is that it followed all the norms in the issue of duplicate
shares and the fact that the original shares were with RCS was not
detected because there was no system of cross-checking. There are no
rules or guidelines on this issue, says RIL.

Switched shares: While the Rajul Vasa issue was hogging headlines, came
the revelation that Unit Trust of India (UTI), which had sent 2.4
million RIL shares to RCS in 1991 for transfer, had got back 870,000
shares which were not part of the lot it had sent. These switched
shares had been frozen by the special court looking into the securities
scam. UTI took up the matter with RCS and the shares were replaced.

It later emerged that switching was a common practice as far as RIL was
concerned. By last count, more than 7 million shares have been
switched. Involved are not just UTI alone, but Peerless and some banks.
The motive behind the switching has still not been ascertained. RIL
says all companies do it but other business houses disagree. The Sebi-
DCA probe is now investigating this angle.

Some feel that UTI and other bulk purchasers were used as a dumping
ground for "tainted" shares (shares involved in the 1992 securities
scandal). No transactions were allowed in such shares by the special
court, but UTI and other institutions would be unlikely to try and sell
them. This explanation has subsequently been replaced by another. It
has been conclusively proved that Reliance investment companies and
trading associates were involved in all these transactions. The theory
is that Reliance trading companies sold large lots of shares but did
not have actual scrips in their possession (this is a normal practice).
When they had to make delivery, they "borrowed" shares from Reliance
investment companies. When these shares were sent to RCS, the original
sellers (the trading companies) replaced them with other shares which
they had acquired in the meantime.

How does this help? The Reliance investment companies hold shares which
they bought a long time ago, some even at par value. If these shares
were sold, capital gains tax would have to be paid on the price
differential, which would work out to a huge amount. So these were used
for delivery purposes and the shares actually sold were picked up from
the markets at higher rates. The capital gains tax was thus nominal. Is
this legal income-tax avoidance or illegal evasion? That will probably
be a matter for the courts to decide.

Fake shares: There are several strands to this. Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) leader Jaswant Singh has written to the finance minister pointing
out that two sets of RIL share certificates held by Syndicate Bank have
the same distinctive numbers but different certificate numbers. These
were among a lot of RIL shares sold by Syndicate Bank through a
stockbroking firm in 1989. The firm returned the certificates to the
bank as these would be treated as bad delivery in the market. According
to government sources, it is not possible for two sets of certificates
to have the same distinctive numbers. The inevitable conclusion: one is
a fake. RIL says that its records do not tally with those in the
certificates in the name of Syndicate Bank.

There are also several RIL share certificates bearing distinctive
numbers that go beyond the official list of distinctive numbers of the
paid-up capital of the company. This gave rise to the suspicion that
the company had issued more shares than its paid-up equity capital. RIL
has an explanation for this, but not everyone is convinced.

Apart from the shares, several other issues concerning Reliance are
creating controversy. An investigation is on into the possible rigging
of the share prices of Reliance Polypropylene Ltd (RPPL) and Reliance
Polyethylene Ltd (RPEL) before their merger with RIL. The big buyers
prior to the merger were companies close to Reliance. Among the names
also figures Rajul Vasa. Inevitably, Reliance has also got sucked into
the major controversy of the day -- the telecom tenders. The
controversial Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL) has been
discovered to be another major buyer of RPPL/RPEL shares. HFCL sources
say their purchases weren't significant and they actually made a loss
on the deal. True, it wasn't significant as far as the RPPL/RPEL equity
goes. But the investment of Rs167m was a big sum for a small company.
Inevitably, opposition MPs have alleged that HFCL is only a front for
Reliance.

Most of these charges will not hold water. But some action is bound to
be taken. RCF's licence may well be suspended and the trading
associates and investment companies in the Reliance stable could be
slapped with an income-tax notice. The real damage, however, is in one
of perceptions. Reliance, once the darling of the stockmarkets, is now
being looked upon with suspicion. Foreign investors are also aghast
that the system permits such machinations. For the Ambanis, BSE-bashing
has proved more damaging than they could ever have expected.

BUSINESS:  ITC'S MISFORTUNE MAY WORK TO BAT'S ADVANTAGE

On January 1, Yogi Deveshwar took over as chairman of ITC. He won the
post, despite opposition from principal shareholder BAT Industries,
because of government support which manifested itself through the
financial institutions. On January 2, it was another arm of the
government which gave him a New Year's gift. The commissioner of
central excise, Delhi, passed an order against the company claiming
Rs7,990m as duty due from ITC and its contract manufacturers. In
addition, the commissioner imposed penalties on the company and six of
its erstwhile directors taking the total excise claim to over Rs8,700m.

ITC will be going to the Customs, Excise and Gold Appellate Tribunal
(Cegat) to appeal against the order, but in many ways the die seems
cast. The case is actually of ancient vintage; the excise claims relate
to the period between March 1, 1983 and February 28, 1987. Besides,
according to excise officials, ITC has already moved both the Calcutta
high court and the Supreme Court and lost.

The issue, though it has done the rounds of the courts and government
departments for several years now, is actually very simple. Excise
officials claim that ITC cut its dealer and retailer margins and
printed a lower price on its cigarette packets. It paid excise on this
printed price. The retailers, however, sold the packets to consumers at
a higher rate to make up their margins. This was done with the full
knowledge of the company. The authorities feel that ITC should have
paid excise on this higher price. It is also claimed that the printed
price was fixed in such a way that the consumers would inevitably have
to pay more. For instance, the printed price on a ten-pack of the best-
selling Wills Filter is today Rs11.75. But they are sold at Rs12 at all
outlets; nobody returns the loose change.

Observers feel that the best ITC can hope for now is a reduction in the
amount it has to pay. The payment could also be staggered. A precedent
has been set in the case of another cigarette manufacturer -- Godfrey
Phillips India -- which faced similar excise claims and fines of Rs570m.
In December, Cegat issued a partial stay of the excise order but asked
the company to pay around one-fourth the amount within three months. If
the same is done in ITC's case, the company will have to find Rs2bn
quickly. Where is the money going to come from? ITC could sell some its
investments in sister companies and finance the rest from its profits.
But this would mean weakening its hold on these companies and -- this is
worse -- displeasing shareholders who may have to go without dividends
for a couple of years.

The other solution is to go hat in hand to BAT. But the UK parent will
obviously demand its pound of flesh -- a greater representation on the
board, a greater say in the management and even an increase in equity
to 51 per cent. According to the Economic Times, India's leading
financial daily, BAT has already begun to buy ITC shares in the market
and has earmarked $60m for this purpose. That strategy may not make too
much sense, as control over ITC is not really a function of BAT's
holding; it depends on the stand the financial institutions take. Other
newspaper reports say that the ITC brass is now prepared to eat humble
pie; it has given up plans to go into power and other sectors and will
toe the BAT line. The excise axe may cost ITC dear but BAT, for one,
has some reason to cheer.

TELECOM:  BALL NOW IN SUPREME COURT

The telecom licensing issue saw the proceedings at the winter session
of parliament come to a total standstill as opposition members demanded
an investigation into the "biggest scam of the times". Apart from
passing some vital bills (such as the approval of President's rule in
Uttar Pradesh), no work could be done during the entire session.

The ball is now with the Supreme Court which has ordered a temporary
stay on basic telecom licences. This means that the tenders for the
five circles already finalised have also been put on hold. However, the
court allowed the government to go ahead with the retendering process
for the 13 other circles. The granting of contracts will only take
place after the final hearing which is scheduled for January 9.

The main argument of the petitioners in the case before the Supreme
Court is that public sector units have been discriminated against by
not allowing them to participate in the bidding, that the rules have
been loaded in favour of the multinationals and the private sector, and
that some private parties -- principally Himachal Futuristic
Communications -- have been given undue advantages.

TELECOM:  REBIDDING FOR THE BASIC CIRCLES IS LUKEWARM

The re-bidding for the 13 basic circles has received an extremely low-
key response. Only five circles were bid for with six companies
participating in the process. In the first round, a total of 16
companies participated with 81 bids being received for the 20 basic
circles on offer. The reason for the poor response is the uncertainty
over the entire issue. Companies are unwilling to commit themselves
before the Supreme Court judgement is delivered. Secondly, several
opposition parties have declared that they will cancel the entire
tendering process if they come to power after the next elections and
companies are not prepared to risk another Enron-type situation.
Besides, many contend that the reserve prices set by the telecom
department are too high to leave room for profits.

Of the circles thrown open for re-tendering, only Punjab attracted two
bids. Essar-Bell Atlantic was the highest with a quote of Rs14,251m
(levy quoted in terms of net present value). Bharti-STET bid Rs13,680m.
The reserve price was Rs12,700m. The bidders in the other four circles
were Tata-Bell Canada Rs13,127m (Andhra Pradesh; reserve price
Rs12,500m); RPG-NTT Rs36,051m (Tamil Nadu; Rs25,500m); Reliance-Nynex
Rs10,537m (Gujarat; Rs10,500m); and Usha-Moscow Telecom Rs1,400.6m
(Bihar; Rs1,400m).

Several majors such as AT&T-Birla, which had bid for four circles last
time, and US West-BPL, which had bid for five circles, stayed out of
the bidding in this round. Also significant is the fact that the bids
are much lower than what Himachal Futuristic Communication Ltd had
quoted before it had to give up the circles because of the cap imposed.
With several circles yet to be taken up, there is likely to be another
round of bidding soon.

TELCOM:  TWENTY LICENCES AWARDED FOR MOBILE SERVICES

Despite the ongoing controversy and the opposition demand that the
entire telecom privatisation process be put on hold until the Supreme
Court ruling, the government has awarded 20 licences to seven companies
for operating cellular mobile telephone services. The licences, awarded
on December 12, are for JT Mobile-Telia, Sweden (Andhra Pradesh and
Punjab); Birla Communications-AT&T, US (Gujarat and Maharashtra);
Escotel-First Pacific, Hong Kong (Uttar Pradesh west, Haryana and
Kerala), Koshika Telecom-Philipino Telecom, the Philippines (Uttar
Pradesh west, Uttar Pradesh east, Orissa and Bihar); Cellular
Communications-Airtouch, US (Tamil Nadu); Reliance Telecom-Nynex, US
(Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, North-east, Assam and
Himachal Pradesh); and Bharti Telenet-STET, Italy (Himachal Pradesh).
The other licences will be awarded shortly.

TELECOM:  JOINT VENTURES MAY CHANGE THE MIXTURE

In another major change of norms, the department of telecommunications
(DoT) is likely to allow consortia which have won licences to operate
cellular mobile services in the country to change their composition.
This has become necessary because of both the continuing confusion over
the award of licences and the fact that, despite all this, the
prospects for business seem better. While those disenchanted with the
chaos want to pull out others want to raise their stakes in the joint
ventures. This is being opposed by their Indian partners. Take the case
of Koshika Telecom which has been granted licences to operate cellular
services in four circles -- Uttar Pradesh (east), Uttar Pradesh (west),
Orissa and Bihar. Koshika is a joint venture between Usha (India) and
Philipino Telephone Corporation, the largest cellular operator in the
Philippines. Usha (India) has dragged Philipino Telephone to Delhi high
court alleging that the company is threatening to pull out unless it is
allowed to hike its stake to 34 per cent. According to DoT
stipulations, the foreign partner cannot dilute its holding to below 10
per cent in the first three years. Thus, if Philipino does pull out,
the Koshika licences will become invalid. While the Delhi high court
has restrained Philipino Telecom from reneging on the deal, it is
recognised that Indian courts may not be able to do much if the foreign
partner is indeed bent on pulling out. DoT may thus have to agree to
the substitution of some other foreign partner.

According to Usha (India), Philipino Telephone has realised late in the
day that the prospects in the Indian telecom sector are indeed very
bright. Usha's counsel told the court that the foreign company is now
arm-twisting its Indian partner to get both a higher stake and a
greater say in the management. Another successful bidder Modicom
Network Private Ltd, which has won the circles of Punjab and Karnataka,
has approached the government with an application that the 26 per cent
stake of its original partner -- Vanguard of the US -- be transferred to
Australian giant Telstra International. Telstra is already operating
cellular services in Calcutta (which was awarded much earlier) with
B.K. Modi of Modicom, so it sees obvious synergies in a tie-up for
Punjab and Karnataka. Incidentally, Telstra had tied up with Spic to
bid for the current round of celular circles but its estimates were way
out of line. In Karnataka, Telstra-Spic bid Rs2,090m while winner
Modicom quoted a figure of Rs13,930m.

A change in partner is also on the cards in the Hinduja-HCL-Singapore
Telecom combine with Singapore Telecom expressing its desire to pull
out. Both the Hindujas and Modicom desperately need another foreign
partner because of the experience requirements DoT has insisted on.

AVIATION:  FOREIGN EQUITY OKAY, BUT NOT NOW

The government has decided in principle to allow up to 40 per cent
foreign equity holding in domestic airlines. But, in a curious rider,
it will not be giving any such blanket permission until the
modernisation programme for the aviation sector is completed. The
programme includes extension of runways, building of terminals and
modernisation of airports. As this is a subjective issue it means, in
effect, that the decision on foreign equity participation has been
postponed indefinitely. However, according to the civil aviation and
tourism ministry, approvals could still be given on a case-to-case
basis as has been done for Jet Airways. Among the applications which
have queued up at the civil aviation ministry's door are those from
Indotik (of the Ravi Tikkoo group) and the Tata-Singapore Airlines
proposal. The government would also have had to decide on the proposal
by ModiLuft to allow Lufthansa to take a 40 per cent stake, but the
foreign carrier is apparently not interested at the moment.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT:  POWER SECTOR ATTRACTS THE MOST MONEY

The infrastructure sector has been attracting the maximum foreign
direct investment (FDI) in the reform era. According to available data,
the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approved a total FDI of
Rs397bn in the period August 1991 to October 1995. Of this the power
sector accounted for the lion's share with Rs60bn (15.11 per cent). Oil
refineries attracted Rs40bn. The total fuel sector (which includes
power and oil refineries) added up to 27.01 per cent. The other big
chunk of FDI went for the telecommunications sector with a total
investment of Rs32.39bn (8.14 per cent). Of this, cellular mobile
telephone services accounted for Rs23.45bn (5.90 per cent). The
consumer goods sector, though the public face of foreign investment,
accounted for only 6.6 per cent (Rs26.27bn) of total FDI. Of this, food
processing provided the biggest chunk with Rs21.94bn (5.51 per cent).
The figures, however, tell only half the story as they relate to the
approvals and not the actual investment. In sectors such as power, the
FDI approval is very high. But most of the projects have been held up
because of various snags and the actual fund inflow has been small. On
the other hand, most of the investments in the food processing sector
have already been made.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT:  MULTINATIONALS LAW PLANNED

Existing multinational subsidiaries in the country are to be put on a
par with those seeking entry. Currently, even 100 per cent foreign-
owned companies can get into unallied lines of business by taking the
takeover/merger route. The government intends to introduce legislation
to debar such companies from getting into new lines of business unless
this is specifically mentioned in the articles and memoranda of
association. Under the current regulations, MNCs can enter new fields
by amending their articles and their memoranda of association in a
general body meeting. In the new scheme of things, central permission
will also be required for such diversification. This has become
necessary because some sectors are still barred for multinationals and
some areas are reserved for the small-scale sector. A few MNCs have,
however, succeeded in getting a toehold through takeovers.

POWER:  ABB SEEKS STAKE IN POWER COMPANIES

The $30bn power major Asea brown Boveri (ABB) is negotiating with
several new power projects in the country to pick up an equity stake in
them. ABB's main intention is to sell its equipment to these projects
and it would have been happy doing just that. Having a stake, however,
gives it the clear edge in equipment supply and is also an indication
of its long-term commitment. Negotiations are thus on with Videocon for
its 1,000 MW Madras project, with Basicorp and GVK for the
Krishnapattam project in Andhra Pradesh, with the Birla Powergen
combine for the Bena project in Madhya Pradesh and with Eisenberg of
Israel for the Yamunanagar project in Haryana. ABB is looking at a 5-20
per cent stake in all these projects. Incidentally ABB already has a 20
per cent stake in the 500 MW Pench project in Madhya Pradesh (Soros
Funds holds the other 80 per cent) and 5 per cent in the 235 MW
Jegurupada project. It will also be picking up a stake in the 250 MW
neyveli project.

HOTELS:  MS SHOES LOSES HOTEL SITE

Following his arrest after charges of price rigging prior to the public
issue of MS Shoes, the woes of promoter Pavan Sachdeva have been
multiplying. In his latest setback, he has been unable to retain the
four-star hotel and shopping complex site in New Delhi. The public
issue was raising money for its development. MS Shoes failed to pay
Rs130m of the Rs481m second instalment (including interest) by the
deadline of December 31. Hudco, which had sold him the land in the
first place, will now put it up for retendering as there is no
provision for offering the site to the second highest bidder in case of
default by the highest bidder.

This is not the first time that the beleaguered Sachdeva has failed to
meet his payment schedules. The second instalment was actually due on
April 30, 1995. But Sachdeva had moved the Delhi high court and
obtained a stay. The court had ordered MS Shoes to make the payment of
Rs415m (plus interest at 24 per cent) by December 31. Now that MS Shoes
has defaulted a second time, the stay stands automatically vacated.

HOTELS:  HOTEL LEELAVENTURE PULLS OUT OF HOTEL PROJECT

Hotel Leelaventure has backed out of the project to develop the Bombay
Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (BMRDA) hotel-cum-
convention centre in the Bandra-Kurla complex. Leela, which had won the
project with a bid of Rs11,330m, failed to make its initial payment
because of a technical hitch. Though the finance for the project had
been tied up, a consortium of financial institutions led by the
Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) refused to release funds
as BMRDA was unwilling to lease the land. While the institutions wanted
an immediate lease, BMRDA maintained that the land would be licensed to
Leela for the first three years and leased thereafter. This had been
specified in the tender offer and BMRDA was unwilling to change any of
the terms at the last moment. The tender had been a hotly contested one
with several multinationals tying up with Indian companies to submit
their bids. BMRDA will now float the tender again as some of the
combines which had submitted bids have since been wound up. However,
with land prices having dropped 15-20 per cent, it is likely to end up
the loser.

the 500,000 tonnes exported earlier in 1995. Exports are being resorted
to because of a bumper harvest.

STOCK ISSUE FLOPS

A Rs20bn government of India stock issue has flopped with only 52 per
cent subscription being received. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had
to subscribe to the balance. This is the third RBI issue for the
government to flop. Earlier, the 14 per cent 2005 paper issued on
November 27 and the floating rate bond issue on December 5 had also
received around 50 per cent subscription.

PRESIDENT'S RULE IMPOSED IN UTTAR PRADESH

In the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, no political party has secured a 
majority, which has resulted in president's rule in the state.  The National 
Conference has been elected to power in Jammu & Kashmir, while in Gujarat, the 
Mahagujarat Janata Party has assumed power.  Former Prime Minister Narsimha 
Rao continues to be involved in legal problems and has been accused in three 
different cases.

The assembly elections in the state of Uttar Pradesh have resulted in a hung
assembly with no political party securing a majority.  The governor has
imposed president's rule in the state.  Even though the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) has secured the highest number of seats, it falls short of a majority.
Both the Congress-Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party-United Front
alliances, in an attempt to keep the BJP from assuming power, have been unable
to arrive at a political understanding.

The National Conference (NC) has been elected to power in the assembly 
elections in the state of Jammu & Kashmir.  The NC, which had an electoral 
alliance with the Janata Dal, secured a decisive two-thirds majority.  The new 
Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah has been sworn in and will head the first 
popular government in the state after seven years of political turmoil.

The Mahagujarat Janata Party (MJP) has assumed power in the state of Gujarat
ending 35 days of President's rule.  Shankersinh Vaghela has been elected the
new Chief Minister of the state.  Earlier, Vaghela had broken away from the
state unit of the BJP which resulted in a split in the party and the dismissal
of the BJP government in Gujarat.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has charged former Prime Minister
Narsimha Rao, for his involvement in a bribery case.  A Delhi court has issued
a non-bailable warrant against Rao for his role in a forgery case.  In a third
case involving cheating, Rao will have to appear before court on November 6.

OUTLOOK

The conflict of interest between the Congress Party and the United Front
government, dissent amongst the constituents of the UF government over the
issue of supporting a Congress-BSP government in the state of Uttar Pradesh
and the likelihood of former Congress Party members rejoining the party,
suggests the possibility of the Congress Party withdrawing support from the UF
government.

RBI ANNOUNCES MONETARY POLICY


The governor of the RBI has announced the monetary policy for the second half
of fiscal 1997.  The policy measures are expected to increase the money supply
in the economy.  The growth rate of industrial production in April-June 1996
was lower than during the same period in the previous year.

The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), C.  Rangarajan has announced
the monetary policy for the second half of 1996-97.  The measures are expected
to increase the money supply in the Indian economy by approximately $4.3
billion.  The RBI will reduce the cash reserve ratio by 2 percentage points.
It will increase the target for export credit as a percentage of a bank's net
credit from 10% to 12% and reduce the maximum permissible interest rates for
deposits with a maturity of 30 days and upto 1 year from 11% to 10%.  In
addition, banks have been allowed to lend their foreign currency non-resident
(bank) deposits in foreign currency-denominated loans to corporations.  The
foreign exchange risk is to be borne by the borrowers.  The RBI has also
imposed a cap of 15% interest on all post-shipment rupee export credits for a
period of 90 days to 180 days.

Industrial production of 172 industries, which account for a weight of 88% in
the overall index of industrial production, registered a growth of 9.9% during
April-June 1996, compared to the same period in 1995.  This is lower than the
15.5% growth recorded in April-June 1995.  The manufacturing, mining and
electric sectors recorded a deceleration in growth in April-June 1996,
compared to the same period in 1995.  Basic goods grew by only 2% compared to
13% during the previous year.  Growth in capital goods remained at 21.1%
during April-June 1996, intermediate goods grew to 13.2% from 3.9%, consumer
durables grew by 21.1% and consumer non-durables grew by 12.2% from the same
period in 1995.

The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) is likely to revise the overall
growth rate of the Indian economy from 7%, stated in the Economic Survey
update, to about 6.3% for 1995-96.  This is primarily because of a negative
growth of 3.19% in agricultural production during fiscal 1996.

OUTLOOK

According to sources in UNESCO, infrastructure investment in India is likely
to rise from the current level of $17 billion a year to about $30 billion by
fiscal 2001.  It is estimated that the total infrastructure investment
requirement over the next 5 years will be between $115 billion and $130
billion.

NEW GUIDELINES FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT ANNOUNCED


The government has announced new guidelines for foreign investment into India. 
Foreign companies will be allowed to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in the 
consumer goods sector but will have to dilute their equity within a stipulated 
period. Policies on mutual funds and the privatization of coal-bed methane have
been further liberalized.

The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has stated that it will allow
foreign companies to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in the consumer goods
sector.  However, these companies will have to dilute their equity and
increase the domestic equity base within a stipulated period of time.  This
divestment policy does not extend to wholly-owned subsidiaries which have
already received government approval or to those firms which have invested in
areas where technology is not locally available.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has announced a new policy for the
privatization of coal-bed methane (CBM).  The CBM projects will be taken out
of the purview of the FIPB and will be subject to international bidding with
production-sharing contracts, similar to the policy on oil and gas
exploration.  This will affect the Reliance-Texaco proposal currently pending
approval from the FIPB.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has announced that mutual
funds will get automatic clearance to launch new funds if the regulatory body
does not raise any query within 21 days of filing of offer documents.
However, fund managers will have to abide by the prevalent SEBI guidelines,
including portfolio disclosures, monthly trading reports and transactions.

The FIPB will not clear wholly-owned marketing subsidiaries in the drugs and
pharmaceuticals sector.  The only exception will be if the subsidiary
manufactures bulk drugs from the basic drug stage.

OUTLOOK

The government will announce detailed guidelines and further amendments to the
National Highway Act of 1956 during the first week of November.  Regulatory
powers are expected to be vested with the National Highways Authority of
India.

BASIC SERVICE PROVIDERS ACCEPT LETTER OF INTENT


Basic services providers, except Basic Teleservices, a joint venture between
RPG and NTT, have accepted the Letter of Intent (LOI) for operating basic
services.  As a result, Communications Minister Beni Prasad Verma has
cancelled the licence earlier awarded to Basic Teleservices and the company
will have to forfeit $14.3 million that it submitted to the Department of
Telecommunication (DoT) in the form of bank guarantees.  The deadline for
accepting the LOI and paying the licence fee was October 18, 1996.
Consortiums that did not pay the licence fees by the deadline will now be
required to pay the licence fees plus a penalty of an additional 5% above the
prime lending rate of the State Bank of India, until licence fees are paid.


Two million government employees, including approximately one million telecom,
postal and telegraph workers had gone on a nationwide strike, demanding the
government remove the eligibility ceiling for payment of bonus.  The strike,
which had paralyzed the functioning of the telecom department for a week, was
called off after the government conceded to their demands.

GOVT APPROVES COGENTRIX COUNTER-GUARANTEES 


The United Front government has approved counter-guarantees for the
Cogentrix-led Mangalore Power Company (MPC).  Cogentrix expects to obtain
financial closure within 5 months.  The government has stated that Cogentrix,
which owns a 60% stake in the 1000MW thermal project, will not be allowed to
dilute its stake below 33%.  China Light & Power owns the remaining 40%
equity.  MPC has offered Karnataka State Electricity Board 40% of the total
equity in the company.  The counter-guarantees will cover capacity and energy
charge payments for the project in the event that State Electricity Boards
(SEB) default or are unable to make payments on time.

The United Front government will grant autonomy to state governments for
approval of power projects.  The government will abolish the mandatory
clearance required from the Central Electricity Authority; state governments
will be required to set up independent regulatory authorities to address
tariff-related issues.  State governments will also be empowered to give
environmental and forest clearances.

GE'S INDIA BUSINESS STRATEGY


Scott Bayman of GE India, outlines the firm's India business strategy.

Prior to the start of liberalization GE chairman and CEO Jack Welch visited
India and liked what he experienced.  After some intensive study, GE declared
India a priority country and began a period of investing.

At a time when many companies maintained the conventional view of India -- a
country overpopulated, poor and bureaucratic; GE took a more optimistic
position.  We saw India as a country of almost 1 billion new consumers for our
products and services.  A country of very talented entrepreneurs and capable
industrialists with a highly educated, technical work force.  And a country
where English is the most common language.

We set out on a strategy of forming alliances with a common purpose.  We saw
India as the heart of a fourth pole offering profitable sales growth.  We
wanted synergistic partners for flow businesses like lighting, plastics and
appliances.  By establishing our flow businesses and broadening our role, we
hoped to leverage this expanded presence to help our project businesses such
as power generation and aircraft engines.  We wanted number one or number two
positions, or a clear plan to get there ...  taking advantage of synergies
with our businesses outside India.

We moved quickly and formed four new operating joint ventures; two green
fields; and two using existing facilities.  These alliances combined GE
Plastics with IPCL; GE Medical Systems with Wipro; GE Appliances with Godrej &
Boyce and GE Lighting with Apar.

In late 1993, GE Capital received permission for a 100% wholly owned holding
company.  Using this as a platform, we formed a joint venture with HDFC called
Countrywide Consumer Financial Services which provided personal financing to
the hundreds of thousands of Indian consumers purchasing TV's, stereos,
appliances and other consumer durables.  Countrywide in turn, is forming joint
ventures with companies like Maruti to offer private label financing.  GE
Capital India also offers a range of services including equipment leasing and
financing, working capital loans, export finance, project finance and
strategic investment.  It is also involved with GE Power systems in the
development of independent power plants and other infrastructure projects.

From this beginning, we have added joint ventures in motors, medical systems
and information services.  Earlier this year, we began a 100 per cent owned
silicones business.  In addition, we are forming joint ventures to provide
services, overhaul and repair for the industrial and power generation
aftermarket.

Our big ticket items such as locomotives, aircraft engines, gas and steam
turbines and aero derivative engines are supported through licenses such as
BHEL and liaison offices.

As you can see, GE does not follow a standard, one dimensional approach.  We
like partners and have a large number of joint ventures around the world.
Whether or not a specific business is a joint venture of wholly owned
subsidiary, is driven by the local market, the availability of strong,
potential partners and local regulations.

Our country priorities for India are clear.  The top priority for each
business is to strengthen its growth strategies to widen leads over
competitors or to gain the number one share position.  Part of our plan is to
look back to what GE did to build its global positions, and bring these
lessons to India.

Our strategy in India is and has been to choose strong partners each of whom
bring value to the venture.  This value add may be in the form of strong brand
and distribution; or management talent and people resources; or existing
manufacturing capabilities in more mature industries; or the know how to build
factories and develop markets for newer industries.  Most important, our
partners share our values; our passion for growth and each has the highest
integrity.  These added values we look for from our partners are far more
important to us than investment dollars.

Ownership structures may change over time for a variety of reasons including
one or the other partner not wishing to continue to invest in the business, or
wishing to divest in order to invest in other more strategic opportunities.

Our strategy is to continue to staff our businesses with Indians.  Currently,
all but one of our businesses is led by either a local national or a
Nonresident Indian.  GE expatriates are here for their expertise and unique
knowledge of GE's products, services or management practices.  We anticipate
the number of expats will decrease over time.

Some of our businesses are fortunate to have joined hands with strong local
brands.  It is our strong desire to grow these brands while introducing the GE
brand for incremental sales, often in different market segments or with
different product positioning.

We are bringing the latest technologies and products to India such as ribbon
processing to lighting, compounding process for our world leading Lexan
plastic and the latest GE Profile refrigerators and washing machines designed
for international standards and climates.  Wipro-GE Medical Systems in
Bangalore had the exclusive design responsibility and is the supplier for all
global requirements for our latest ultra sound diagnostic product.

Our strategy is to bring GE's management know-how to India.  We hold two best 
practices sharing sessions each year with all the businesses where we exchange 
ideas and lessons and importantly, talk about how to adapt these to the Indian 
Market.  Our partners frequently send teams from their other businesses to 
participate.

A big focus of our cross business synergy is people development.  In 1995, we
trained over 900 managers, and this year, we will exceed 1000.  The courses
are the same as those developed and taught at Crotonville, our management
development center in the U.S.  Again, our partners' other businesses
frequently participate.

We have implemented GE's early leadership development programs for technical,
finance, information management and human resource specialists.  These
programs are available to all the businesses in India, and we currently have
124 participants.

CAMEROON-ENVIRONMENT:  FACING UP TO THE EUCALYPTUS MENACE

By Tansa Musa
   NKAMBE, Cameroon, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- The view from the third floor
of the Central Hotel in this small town tucked away in Cameroon's
North West Province is dominated by dense forests occasionally
broken by rooftops.
   It looks good, especially in a country which has been losing its
tree cover at an annual rate of about 0.6 per cent.
   But province officials are worried. The trees around Nkambe and
other areas in the northwest are eucalyptus, noted for the large
amounts of water they absorb.
   "We are dealing with an unnoticed crisis," says Raphael Kongor,
an environmental officer in Nkambe. "People have been growing
eucalyptus without regard for their water and food needs. Today we
are having unusually harsh dry seasons because the eucalyptus trees
are draining our waterways."
   Area residents confirm that water is becoming increasingly
scarce here. "Our streams are now dry most of the year and our
women and children have to travel long distances in search of
water," says Chona Patrick, a farmer in Nkambe. "And they also have
to go far, sometimes 15 to 20 kilometers away, to find fertile
farmland."
   Eucalyptus was first introduced in the hilly grasslands of the
North West Province by colonial administrators to meet their wood
and fuel needs and protect their homes from windstorms during the
rainy season. Local villagers followed suit.
   Since independence, Cameroon's government has encouraged the
regulated growth of eucalyptus, according to Nelson Chomba, a
forestry technician with the National Office for the Development
of Forests.
   "We encourage the planting of eucalyptus on barren, marginal
land, usually hilltops, far away from water catchment areas and the
sources of streams," Chomba told IPS. "We recommend that farmers
plant the trees at least 50 to 100 meters away from such areas."
   But it has proved hard to limit the planting of eucalyptus.
   Unlike coffee, the main cash crop in the area, growing
eucalyptus requires little labor and few supplies. "Plant it even
on rocky soil and it grows," says Kongor. "All you need to do is
clear a tract around the plantation to protect it from dry-season
brush fires."
   Moreover, it has a variety of uses. The branches make good
fuelwood. Mix the dried leaves with lime juice and you have a cheap
cough mixture, while the trees themselves act as windbreaks and can
also be used to mark the boundaries of farms.
   More importantly, however, there is money in eucalyptus. Its
wood can be sold and, with the prices of traditional cash crops
like coffee and cocoa fluctuating on the world market, there is
hardly a family in the districts of Donga-Mantung division, which
includes Nkambe and neighboring Bui, that does not have a
eucalyptus plantation or at least a few trees.
   It has also spread southwards to the Western province and is
gaining ground in the drier northern provinces of Adamawa and the
north, especially since there is quick cash to be made by selling
eucalyptus poles to the national electricity corporation, SONEL,
and the local telephone utility.
   "Every year I make about 100,000 CFA francs (about $220) from
selling poles to SONEL alone,"says Chona. "I've been producing
coffee for a long time but I don't get so much money from that."
   Patrick Bui, a farmer in Bui district, vows that nothing will
stop him from growing eucalyptus. "Look," he says, pointing to
bundles of firewood stacked along the main highway. "Do you know
how much I make every day from these?"
   "This gives me about 1,500 to 2,000 CFA francs (between $3.30
and $4.40) every day, which I use to pay the fees for my three
children in secondary school, buy (cooking) oil, soap and other
things for my family and to contribute to my 'njangui' (informal
savings and loan cooperative)."
   But the cost to the environment is high, says Kongor, who
explains that the eucalyptus has roots that go deep into the soil
to find water, which is why it should be grown on dry marginal
land.
   "Though the plant can help raise the water level, its
destructive nature cannot be overlooked," he adds. "It drains the
soil of valuable nutrients and water that other plants and crops
need to grow."
   However, "It would be useless to call on farmers not to plant
eucalyptus trees, considering the importance of such a plant
species in non-forest areas," says Kongor.
   "Our only weapon is to educate the farmers about proper forestry
techniques and the need to diversify economic activity to other
productive areas, like bee-farming."

LATIN AMERICA-HUMAN RIGHTS:  STILL PENDING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

By Daniel Gatti
   MONTEVIDEO, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- "Your children are here, what pride
you must feel," exclaimed Hebe de Bonafini, leader of the
Argentinean Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, speaking in the name of
the thousands who disappeared during the military dictatorship of
1976-83.
   For the first time in years, the annual Resistance March
organized by the group on Dec. 7 filled the central Plaza de Mayo
to capacity.
   "Three generations marched together," read the headline in
Argentinean daily Pagina 12 the following day, as grandmothers,
mothers and the children of the disappeared marched together.
   "We children are here," declared a young member of Children for
Identity and Justice against Oblivion and Silence (HIJOS).
   "For years they wanted us to be nobody's children. Today we are
fighters. Our parents march with us," he added.
   "Two decades later, the wound opened by the military
dictatorship and its atrocities is still open, and the question has
not been resolved," said one protester.
   Official and unofficial estimates state that between nine and
thirty thousand people disappeared under the military dictatorship
that began with Lt. Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla.
   Human rights issues were front and center in Argentina in 1995,
with one leading army officer, Martin Balza, admitting his guilt
and distancing himself from the abuses of the military regime.
Balza's gesture was preceded by confessions from several members
of army personnel involved in the violations, and was followed by
more gentle "mea culpas" from the navy and air force leaders.
   The human rights issue also resurfaced in Chile, Brazil,
Uruguay, Central America and Colombia.
   In Chile, the ghost of the dictatorship reared its ugly head
once more as the issue of army power returned to the fore.
   The public also followed the progress of the case of Gen. Manuel
Contreras and a parliamentary proposal to suspend the prosecution
of 600 military officers accused of assassinations, abductions and
torture during the 1973 to 1990 period.
   In May, General Contreras and Brigadier Pedro Espinosa were
found guilty of masterminding the murder of former Chilean foreign
minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, in 1976.
   This verdict led Chilean human rights organizations to believe
the end of military impunity might be in sight, but when it took
three months to get Contreras into prison it became clear that the
armed forces still held great sway.
   Former dictator Augusto Pinochet is currently Chilean military
Chief of Staff.
   Suspicions were further confirmed when a parliamentary proposal
suggested putting a "full stop" to the prosecution of army
personnel accused of human rights offenses, and the Senate voted
earlier this month not to release information on the disappearances
and killings.
   Brazil also saw a resurfacing of human rights cases from the
sixties and seventies, and the current sitaton there earned the
nation the title "the nation of impunity."
   Around mid-year, Fernando Cardoso's government approved
compensation payments to the families of the dozens of people who
disappeared under the dictatorship of 1964-85. Most of these cases
were never investigated and no one was ever punished.
   Meanwhile, the group Human Rights Watch criticized the nation,
saying that the climate of impunity was encouraging the Military
Police and other security forces to commit "systematic breaches of
human rights."
   The group condemned the possible executions of dozens of common
criminals, militant rural workers and street children, especially
in cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and areas with land
use and ownership disputes.
   "This country has a culture of impunity which it has dragged
along for decades, which feeds on the worsening social inequalities
which lead the most powerful to use soldiers and the police against
the 'dangerous classes'," said one member of the Landless Movement.
   This same "culture" is alive and well in Central America, where
the dictatorships are disappearing within a generalized situation
of civil violence. A report from the Committee for the Defense of
Human Rights in Central America (CODEHUCA) condemned the resurgence
of death squads who target either their political opponents or
"common criminals."
   The situation which permits the incalculable number of
extra-judicial executions and the impunity of the murderers wears
away at the official legal system and corrupts the political
structure the report said.
   It said that the increasing regional crime rate feeds on
poverty, unemployment, and the fact that thousands of civilians
still possess their weapons, often from when they fought in the
civil wars.
   CODEHUCA calculated that there were around two million firearms
loose in Honduras, 300,000 in El Salvador and 250,000 in Guatemala,
concluding that the isthmus nations "are sitting on a social time
bomb without knowing when or how it's going to explode."

MOZAMBIQUE-ECONOMY:  POLITICIANS FIRE AWAY AT BRETTON WOODS

By Gustavo Mavie
   MAPUTO, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- Mozambique's politicians, divided for
decades by ideological differences and war, have now united against
economic policies they blame for increasing poverty in one of the
world's poorest nations.
   "The (International Monetary Fund) IMF and the World Bank are
not interested in the economic development of Mozambique," charges
Antonio Palange of the opposition Democratic Union (UD), one of
three parties that won parliamentary seats in the country's first
ever multiparty elections, held in October 1994.
   Palange recently joined other parliamentarians from the UD, the
Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO, the largest opposition
group), and the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique
(FRELIMO) in lashing out at the government's "marriage" to the
Bretton Wood institutions "at the expense of the Mozambican
people."
   This development is astonishing since Renamo has traditionally
been considered an ally of the West and FRELIMO was once avowedly
Marxist.
   Hoping to keep afloat an economy battered by prolonged civil war
and a socialist experiment that kicked off with the end of
Portuguese rule in 1975, FRELIMO opted for a market economy in 1987
at the behest of the international finance houses.
   But instead of recovery and prosperity, the structural
adjustment program (SAP) has brought most Mozambicans only more
misery, critics note. Even the government is uneasy about some
recommendations of the Bretton Woods pair, such as selling state
companies to curb government spending.
   Most of the 500 parastatals sold so far have passed into foreign
hands as few locals have the capital to purchase them, a fact which
has convinced many here that privatization threatens national
sovereignty.
   The IMF and World Bank are urging a reluctant government to sell
off the national carrier, LAM, the water and electricity companies,
the national railways and ports, customs and the post and
telecommunications' utility.
   But the government considers these enterprises of strategic
importance and prefers to turn them into financially autonomous
public companies with private management.
   In the meantime, the tariffs these utilities charge have soared,
especially for energy. In state housing projects, for example,
monthly electricity bills are more than 100 times as high as
rentals.
   Many here wonder exactly whom the policies touted by the Bretton
Woods institutions are aimed at helping, and not just because of
their social cost.
   When Trade and Industry Minister Oldeniro Baloi announced that
the World Bank had threatened to cut off funding unless Mozambique
exported its cashew nuts unprocessed, this was perceived here as
a bid to smash the many well-equipped factories that process the
nuts, Mozambique's second largest export after prawns.
   "There's no doubt that it's the wrong strategy to
de-industrialize Mozambique in exchange for a fistful of dollars,"
says Teodata Hunguana, a FRELIMO deputy who has held various
ministerial posts. He believes selling its few products cheaply is
a luxury Mozambique can ill afford.
   The IMF is "the new ministry of colonies," quipped fellow
FRELIMO deputy Sergio Vieira, also a former cabinet minister. "Let
the IMF keep its money. We should develop and modernize our
agriculture and protect our industry."
   Fruits of the program remain so elusive that it has been
extended five years beyond its original duration of three years,
leaving most people here with their "belts tightened right to the
bone," notes Carlos Cardoso, the outspoken editor of Mediafax, an
independent daily.
   Perhaps the bitterest pill for the 16 million inhabitants of
this southern African state is the dramatic fall in their money's
buying power, while prices and inflation gallop out of control.
   In the last eight years, the value of the national currency, the
metical, has plunged dramatically. In 1987, one U.S. dollar was
equivalent to 40 meticais at the official exchange rate and forty
times more on the black market. Today it is worth 10,826 meticais
officially and 11,500 on the black market.
   Unemployment is rife but those with jobs are scarcely better off
than the jobless. Many earn little more than the $20 monthly
minimum wage, which is barely more than half the $34 needed to buy
a 50 kilogram bag of rice, a staple here.
   At least 70 per cent of Mozambicans live below the poverty line,
yet for years the government kept the minimum wage at 78,000
meticais (seven U.S. dollars) in keeping with a wage freeze
recommended by the Bretton Woods institutions. It only raised it
three months ago after trade unions threatened a general strike.
   The pay hike infuriated IMF representative Sergio Leite who
slammed it as "completely unrealistic" and "inopportune." Leite
attacked waste by the government and warned at a press conference
that "we are going to order more cuts in government expenditure."
   Stung by what they deemed Leite's arrogance and disrespect for
their country's sovereignty, local newspapers said he had insulted
Mozambique's workers and wondered how much he earned at the IMF.
   Palange slammed "constant interference in Mozambique's economic
development by the World Bank" and urged the government to end its
"dependence on the IMF" as other African states have done after
realizing that its programs "do more harm than good to their
economies and social fabric."
   Later, another IMF official said it was up to individual
governments to fix minimum wages, but few here were placated.
   While critics call for a more independent stance by the
government, Planning and Finance Minister Tomas Salomao said
recently in parliament that it would be suicidal for Mozambique to
cut ties with its backers. The Paris Club injected $1 billion into
the country in 1995 and foreign aid accounts or around half of the
1996 budget, which totals slightly more than $605 million.
   Of the 1996 budget, $316 million will go towards rehabilitating
infrastructure destroyed during the civil war (1975-1992).
Recurrent costs should swallow up $287 million.
   The government's dependence on aid could be reduced if it
tightened up on illegal exports, which rob the treasury of millions
of dollars and in which many state officials are allegedly
involved.
   Official statistics show that between January and September,
$600 million was spent on imports and only $126 million worth of
goods were exported. But according to investigations by Mediafax,
illegal exports topped $800 million, most of which was banked
abroad.
   Salomao maintains that IMF's programs appear to be fruitless
only because "they are difficult to put into practice," but critics
insist that government members have been adhering to these programs
rather than slash their own salaries and other benefits derived
from co-operation with the finance houses.
   Neither the IMF's threats nor public disgruntlement have stemmed
the largely unchecked corruption and opulent lifestyles of those
in power and their associates. Almost all present and former
members of government hold shares in privatized companies and new
ones that are being set up. Many have built luxury houses in posh
city neighborhoods in addition to country houses to which they
retreat on weekends and holidays.
   Pajeros, Mercedes Benz, BMWs and other luxury vehicles litter
the streets, and yet "machibombas," minibuses on which the public
relies for transport, are scarce.
   Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi says an independent authority is
to be set up to combat corruption, but most people here feel this
is empty talk.

PALESTINE-HUMAN RIGHTS:  EDITOR JAILED FOR DEFYING ARAFAT'S WISH

By Deborah Horan
   JERUSALEM, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- The release of a Palestinian
newspaper editor detained for six days after failing to prominently
display a flattering article about Yasser Arafat has not eased
fears of a further clampdown on freedom of speech in liberated
Palestine.
   Maher al-Alameh, night editor of the Jerusalem-based Arabic
daily al-Quds, was freed yesterday after a week under interrogation
in the Palestinian self-rule enclave of Jericho. He had been
detained Dec. 25 by the Palestinian Preventive Security (PPS).
   His crime was failing to give enough prominence to flattering
comments about Arafat made by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of
Jerusalem. The Patriarch, greeting Arafat in Bethlehem on Christmas
Eve, had compared him to the revered second Caliph of Islam, Omar
bin el-Khatab, who captured Jerusalem in AD 638.
   All Palestinian newspapers received orders from Arafat's advisor
Nabil Abu Rudeineh to emphasize the Patriarch's comments on their
front page. When al-Alameh put it on page 8 instead he was summoned
to Jericho and detained.
   After a week in detention, during which time al-Alameh, 50, says
he was treated well, he was taken to Ramallah to meet Arafat
yesterday morning. "He (Arafat) asked me why I did not put the news
(on page one) concerning the Patriarch and the description of
Arafat as Caliph Omar," al-Alameh told IPS.
   Al-Alameh said he told Arafat that the reason was purely
practical. Eight per cent of the front page was election
advertising and the rest -- "four columns and a color picture" --
was all about Arafat and the full text of his speech in Bethlehem.
   "I didn't mean to hurt his feelings. It was only because I
didn't have space," he said. "We can't publish all the news of
Arafat on the front page. He (Arafat) was very polite. He said 'I'm
sorry' and kissed my head. He said, 'I don't like to arrest any of
my brothers.'"
   But the detention was seen as another serious blow to press
freedom under Arafat. Members of the Paris-based media rights NGO
Reporters Without Borders tried to visit al-Alameh in Jericho but
were refused entry on the orders of PPS head Jibril Rajoub.
   "I don't think it is a crime. It is a very, very silly pretext
to arrest a person and the timing is very, very bad," said al-
Alameh. "It comes on the eve of elections and of our claim we are
building a democratic entity."
   "They must respect human rights," said Bassem Eid, the
Palestinian representative of Reporters Without Borders. "The PPS
cannot go around kidnapping people."
   "If you don't respect the freedom of the press," added
al-Alameh, "how can you build a democracy?" Arafat officials
declined to comment; Rajoub would merely confirm to IPS that
al-Alameh had been released.
   Arafat has been making an effort to improve his troubled
relations with the Palestinian Christian community and to reassure
wary Christians that they are welcome to stay under the newly
emerging Palestinian government in the West Bank and Gaza.
   To further his initiative, Arafat asked all Arabic newspapers
in Palestine to prominently display the comments of the Patriarch
as evidence of the sympathy and support he was getting from
Christian leaders.
   Al-Quds, published in east Jerusalem, is the largest Arabic
daily and has a circulation of 25,000. Its circulation in the West
Bank has been stopped several times in the past after it published
articles critical of the Palestinian Authority's activities.
   In August 1994, Arafat ordered the daily an-Nahar closed after
it ran a story entitled "I Am A Jordanian From Hebron" at a time
when the Authority was experiencing strained relations with the
Hashemite Kingdom over the role each will play in Jerusalem.
   Last May, Arafat closed down the opposition Hamas newspaper
al-Watan for three months and jailed its editor for two years for
printing material that "harmed national unity." A recent press law
enacted by Arafat makes it a crime to print anything determined to
be damaging to "the national cause."
   "The Palestinian Authority maintains that if you are criticizing
them, you are harming 'national unity,'" said Eid, who is opposed
to the press law. "All we can hope for is that public opinion will
force them to change the policies."
   "He (Arafat) doesn't have the right (to arrest members of the
press)," said al-Alameh, "but...we are a non-democratic system so
he has the ability to order the newspapers to print whatever he
wants them to because they are afraid of action from Arafat. All
of them are in a cycle of fear."
   On several occasions, newspapers have been prevented from
distributing in Gaza after printing articles perceived as
unfavorable to Arafat or the Palestinian Authority. Security men
have also visited an-Nahar and allegedly threatened staff.
   The Palestinian Authority has also been criticized by human
rights organizations for arresting prominent figures in Gaza for
speaking out against government measures that have curbed speech.
   Nine months ago, prominent Palestinian human rights activist
Raji Sourani was arrested for producing a document that criticized
the government's handling of human rights issues.
   Earlier this month, Gaza psychiatrist and leading local activist
Eyad Sarraj was arrested in connection with criticisms of the
Authority's human rights policies made in an address to an
international seminar on journalists and the peace process
organized by Inter Press Service under the European Union's
PeaceMedia program. The seminar had also been addressed by senior
Palestinian Authority officials and the editor of al-Watan.
   Like al-Alameh, Sarraj was not formally arrested but was
"invited" to go for "discussions" with security officials. The
discussions turned into de facto detention.
   "I was treated very well. It was not under the conditions of a
prison," said al-Alameh, who was worried enough about the summons
from Rajoub to take a foreign journalist with him when he went.
   "I was treated respectfully, kindly -- maybe because they knew
I am famous and the international media covered my story. I think
this had pressure on them." But he was sure that had he refused the
summons he would have been forcibly taken. "I was threatened that
if I didn't go on my own they would kidnap me and put me in a car
or they would tear me to pieces."
   The article was politically sensitive for Arafat as it came on
the heels of a Catholic conference that focused on the state of
Christians in the Holy Land and amid accusations from several
Christian groups that their communities are afraid to stay in the
West Bank once it comes completely under Palestinian self-rule.
   To counter these claims, which the Palestinian Authority
dismisses as propaganda propagated by pro-Israeli or pro-Zionist
Christian groups, Arafat has been sprinkling his speeches with
comments aimed at making the Christian community feel more at ease.
   He attended the Christian mass at the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem, where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born, and has
set a quota for Christian candidates running for seats in the
Palestinian Council (parliament), to ensure they are represented.
   Arafat's wife, Suha, a Greek Orthodox Palestinian Christian who
converted to Islam to marry her husband in 1990, has also been
making an effort to quell Christians' perceived fears.
   She visited the Church of the Nativity two days before Christmas
and had their five-month-old baby girl blessed. Christians, who
make up about three per cent of the population of the West Bank,
steadily left during the seven-year uprising against Israeli rule
in search of better living conditions -- as did many Muslims.
   But since the Oslo accord establishing Palestinian self-rule was
signed two years ago, some 40 prominent Bethlehem Christian
families have chosen to leave, increasing the feeling that they do
not feel welcome under the Palestinian Authority.
   Many Christians who left earlier, however, have said they plan
to return once the Palestinian enclaves attain full independence
from Israel.
   For Palestinians the most acute problem is the forthcoming
elections on Jan. 20. The view here is that even if serious
campaigns are mounted against Arafat's candidacy, Arafat's control
of the media will deny them equal space.
   In the longer term the media controls are undermining the
democratic system here, says al-Alameh.
   "We haven't freedom of the press. We do not have the press which
forced (President Richard) Nixon to resign. We do not have the
press which forced (then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak) Rabin to
resign." Rabin resigned after journalists uncovered the fact that
his wife had a then illegal foreign bank account.
   "We haven't the press to make the Authority afraid of it. We
have an Authority that makes the press afraid. It's a disaster.
It's a catastrophe."

CHILE:  GDP GROWTH BEATS INFLATION FOR THE FIRST TIME

By Gustavo Gonzalez
   SANTIAGO, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- Among Chile's economic achievements
in 1995, a rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth that
exceeded the rate of inflation is a particular source of pride for
Treasury Minister Eduardo Aninat.
   The Chilean GDP grew 8.2 per cent -- 8.3 per cent over the 1994
level to $62 billion, while the consumer price index (CPI) grew by
an estimated 8.1 per cent or a maximum of 8.2 per cent.
   This is the first time since Chilean statistical records have
been kept that GDP grew as much or more than the CPI under
conditions of economic expansion and low inflation.
   The 1995 growth in production "means that production has almost
doubled over the past 10 years," a satisfied Aninat told
journalists as he presented economic data for the year on Dec. 28.
   "Chile is included among the ten emerging economies with the
best records in the world this year," the minister added, and
pointed out that investment amounted to 26 per cent of GDP.
   Aninat's briefing ratified the findings of an Economic
Commission for Latin America (ECLA) report released last week that
listed Chile as the region's best growth performer in 1995.
   ECLA and other international organizations attribute the Chilean
success to a combination of fiscal discipline, incentives for
domestic saving and foreign investment, and protection against
short-term capital flows.
   The Chilean stock market experienced only "a slight dizziness"
in the first trimester of 1995 as a result of the so-called
"tequila effect" that originated in Mexico's financial crisis and
hit other countries hard, especially Argentina.
   Chilean foreign investment is concentrated in production
activities, mostly in the mining sector, and the country is host
to relatively little of the short-term or "volatile" capital whose
flight precipitated the Mexican and Argentinean crises.
   It is true that Chile's strong economic performance this year
was aided by good international market prices for the country's
principal exports, including copper, fish meal, and cellulose.
   But this doesn't take credit away from Chile because prices rose
this year for almost all major Latin American exports, with the
exception of soybeans and beef.
   Although it confronts the same problems of inequality and
inequity as does the rest of the region, Chile can also claim a
real increase in GDP per capita, which Aninat says is between five
and six per cent.
   ECLA reports that Chilean GDP per capita grew 2.4 per cent in
1994 and rose to 6.4 per cent this year, while the rest of Latin
America and the Caribbean suffered a decline in per capita GDP of
1.1 per cent.
   While the regional unemployment rate rose from 6.4 per cent last
year to 7.4 per cent in 1995, Chile succeeded in reducing its rate
from 6.3 per cent to 5.6 per cent, which still remains high
compared to the 4.1 per cent rate in 1993.
   Real wages -- after factoring in inflation -- either fell or
stagnated in almost all of the countries in the region in 1995 but
they rose by 4 per cent in Chile.
   While offering this successful 1995 accounting, Aninat promised
the poorest Chileans that "the economic model will continue
incorporating a high level of equality and equity."
   At the other extreme, the minister displayed the caution typical
of a government reluctant to engage in confrontations with business
by inviting the high-income sectors "to continue contributing to
the country's economic efforts."
   Is Chile's economic success the product of a continuation of
neo-liberal policies inherited from General August Pinochet's
dictatorship (1973-90) or is it the fruit of combining a market
model with social redistribution policies?
   This question continues to be debated, especially by the
Pinochet supporters on the right wing, who insist that the present
government is merely profiting from the military regime's "sowing"
and that business enterprise is to be credited for the economic
growth.
   To measure the reestablished democracy's economic performance,
Aninat presented comparative statistics for the 1991-95 period
derived from ECLA and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
   Chile's average annual GDP growth rate over the period is 7.4
per cent, the highest in Latin America and far above the comparable
figure for the region (2.8 per cent), all developing countries (5.8
per cent) and the rest of the world (2.6 per cent).
   Chile's average annual inflation rate over the period was 12.1
per cent compared to 284.4 per cent for Latin America and 35.4 per
cent for all of the developing world.
   Finally, real wages grew 4.3 per cent in Chile during the five-
year period, while they increased by an average of only 1.9 per
cent in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

MALAYSIA-LABOR:  MIGRANT WORKERS EXPLOITED

By Kalinga Seneviratne
   KUALA LUMPUR, Jan. 1 (IPS) -- Malaysia's rapid economic growth
has made it a magnet for migrant workers but exploitation by
employers has dashed many of their hopes of earning a decent
living.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad plans to make Malaysia a fully
developed nation by 2020, and economic expansion has led to a
serious labor shortage which as prompted the country to open its
doors to workers fleeing poverty and unemployment in other parts
of Asia.
   There are now an estimated two million guest workers in this
nation of 19.6 million people. Half of these migrants hold legal
work permits while the rest entered illegally, mainly through
Thailand and Indonesia.
   Indonesians initially dominated the market with cheap labor but
Bangladeshis are now a force to be reckoned with. There are now at
least 200,000 Bangladeshi workers in the country -- more than half
of them working in plantations and factories.
   Malaysia has reached an agreement with Bangladesh to recruit
50,000 skilled and semi-skilled workers -- including nurses and
doctors -- every year.
   Increasing numbers of middle-class Malaysians are employing
domestic helpers mainly from the Philippines, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh. Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka Ting has admitted the
immigration department has a backlog of at least 10,000
applications for work permits for foreign maids.
   Unscrupulous employers, however, are exploiting the desperation
of many of the Asian workers fleeing from poverty at home.
Bangladeshis, who come from one of the world's poorest countries
with a per capita income of $180 a year, are the most vulnerable.
   "Recruiting agencies promise them $300 a month if they come to
Malaysia," says welfare worker S. Sinnappan. He says that many
young university graduates, lured by promotional photos and videos,
end up getting only half this amount.
   Most of the Bangladeshi plantation workers with whom Sinnappan
works had been promised jobs as technicians or engineers. They had
never worked in plantations and were not used to the heavy work in
the palm-oil plantations.
   "They paid the agencies as much as 6,000 ringgit (about $2,400)
to come here. Many raised the money by mortgaging their land or
house," he adds.
   G. Rajasekaran, secretary-general of the Malaysian Trade Union
Congress, says they do not object to migrant labor, provided the
government makes sure there are still jobs left for Malaysians.
   The government has drawn up regulations, but enforcement is very
weak, he says. "It has become so chaotic," he observed, "because
recruitment is done through recruiting agents."
   Rajasekaran says such agencies have mushroomed in recent years
because it is an easy way to make big money without any capital
outlay. "You just bring a person here, collect money from the
person who wants to work, and collect money from the company that
wants to employ him."
   He says exploitation happens at both ends and has led to
corruption involving, for example, the forging of work permits and
other documents. He favors government-to-government deals but is
worried that an unregulated labor influx will undermine working
conditions.
   "Despite impressive economic growth rates in the last five
years, wage levels and living standards of Malaysian workers --
especially industrial workers -- have not gone up as much as they
should have," he says, and the flood of foreign workers has
affected the bargaining power of trade unions.
   "If the government didn't allow foreign workers to come in, even
without collective bargaining, wage rates would have gone up
because of supply and demand ," argues Rajasekaran.
   He says that because of the comparatively low wage rates in
Malaysia, as many as 60,000 Malaysians cross the border each day
to work in Singapore, where a factory worker gets about $380 per
month compared with $160 a month for the same job at home.
   A task force on foreign labor has recommended a monthly wage of
$140 but some firms pay only $110. Locals refuse to work for such
wages, and companies use this as an excuse to turn to foreign
workers. The government this month warned it would no longer
tolerate such exploitation.
   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who heads the cabinet's
Committee on Foreign Workers, is concerned about the impact of
foreign workers on employment opportunities for Malaysians.
   "We will not accept foreign workers at the expense of
Malaysians, especially the younger generation, who are entering the
employment market. We want to ensure that priority is given to
Malaysians for all employment opportunities," he said.
   In his 1996 budget Anwar, who is also Minister of Finance,
increased the levy on foreign workers by 100 per cent. He also
announced in August that foreign job seekers can now be recruited
only as domestic helpers or shop assistants.
   P. Arunasalam, secretary-general of the Electrical Industry
Workers Union, urged the government to gradually phase out its
labor-intensive industries and instead train Malaysians to overcome
the shortage of skilled labor suited for high-technology
industries.
   He warns an increase in foreign labor will put more demands on
the government schooling system to take care of the workers'
children. He says many foreign workers have already forced small
traders in Malaysia to give up their trade at night markets.
   "Huge sums of money remitted by the foreign workers to their
respective countries of origin are a big drain on our country's
economy," says Arunasalam. "In 1994 alone, $960 million was sent
out of the country by one million workers."
   Rajasekaram argues that because of the low wage rates cushioned
by foreign labor, many Malaysian women are not encouraged to join
the workforce. He cites an official report last year saying
Malaysia would have 729,000 more workers if more women were
encouraged to work.
   Many Malaysians are now questioning the pace of development in
their country, while others think the problems of illegal migration
and exploitation of foreign labor should be addressed first.

POPULATION:  MEXICAN EMIGRATION UNAFFECTED BY NAFTA

   MEXICO CITY, Jan. 1 (IPS) -- The North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), now two-years-old, has not had the expected
spectacular effect on the flow of migrants between Mexico and the
United States, according to demographic experts.
   Manuel Alva Hernandez, a researcher with the Colegio de Mexico,
told IPS that "population movements generally follow very complex
and slowly evolving trends, so that -- except in wartime -- they
don't happen suddenly."
   He noted that NAFTA -- the trading block linking Canada, the
United States and Mexico inaugurated on Jan. 1, 1994 -- has 374
million inhabitants and an annual product of $7 trillion but "only
ratified an existing process of integration."
   Alva Hernandez explained that there already had been a
privatizing trend in Mexico, along with significant productive and
speculative capital investment from the United States and other
countries, and that neither phenomenon had increased dramatically
in the two years the treaty has been in effect.
   Nor is there evidence, despite the economic crisis that has
battered Mexico since December 1994, of a major increase in Mexican
migration to the United States as it is often stimulated by family
or friendship ties along with work incentives, Alva Hernandez
added.
   International migration into Mexico did not play a major role
in the country's demographics during the first half of this
century, nor did large numbers of Mexicans emigrate, although there
was a constant outflow, mostly to the U.S.
   But a large increase in Mexican migration to the U.S. has been
evident in recent decades, especially the last 20 years, although
there has been no significant rise in migration into Mexico.
   Hence, Mexico shows a negative migratory balance sheet with the
outside world and has lost 290,000 inhabitants annually in recent
years. This has reduced its internal population growth rate by an
estimated 0.32 per cent.
   Significant migration to the U.S. began in the middle of the
nineteenth century after the U.S. occupied more than half of what
was then Mexico and rose during the revolutionary period (1910-
1919).
   During these years, about 200,000 Mexicans moved to the border
states of Texas, Arizona and California to work in agriculture, on
railroad lines and, to a lesser extent, in industry.
   The first world war (1914-1918) and the international economic
crisis that broke out in 1929 and lasted through the following
decade diminished the migratory flow, which rose again during the
second world war (1939-1945), when labor was needed to replace
workers enlisted in military service.
   The documented and undocumented migration of Mexicans living in
the United States in 1950, 1960, and 1970 was 630,000, 834,000 and
1,399,000, respectively.
   Beginning in the 1970's, this number rose rapidly. In 1980, it
was over 2,500,00 and it reached 4,500,000 in 1990, a number
equivalent to slightly more than 5.4 per cent of Mexico's census
population that year.
   During this entire period, the relative proportion of urban
migrants, non-agricultural workers and women within the total
population of migrants increased.
   This has changed the old U.S. stereotype of the Mexican migrant
as a poorly educated rural laborer seeking seasonal or temporary
work.
   A major contributor to this demographic change was the Mexican
economic crisis that began in 1980 and has become chronic since
then, with only a partial interruption during the first half of the
present decade.
   A change in the U.S. economy that affected the magnitude and
composition of demand for migratory labor also had an effect.
   Yet another influence was the 1986 reform of U.S. immigration
law, which encouraged some migrants to seek U.S. residence and
provided for the employment of migrants in some production
activities.
   According to some Mexican analysts, including noted
anthropologist Soledad Gonzalez Montes, "the development of
functional social networks that link places of origin with
destinations" played a special role in the new migration.
   This analysis suggests that once the Mexican population in the
United States reached a certain threshold, growing social networks
lowered the costs and risks associated with international migration
and increased the probability that potential migrants would make
the move.
   All of these factors gave the migratory movement a powerful push
even as regional economic development created new departure points
throughout Mexico's territory and increased the number of migrating
women and children.
   The number of entire families and those seeking family
reunification also rose among migrants.
   Gonzalez Montes pointed out "a growing concentration (of
migrants) in the states of California and Texas and in the
metropolitan areas of these and other (U.S.) states."
   Statistics show that the length of stay of Mexican migrants in
the United States has grown and that almost two thirds of those
covered by the 1986 legal residency program had been living in that
country for more than a decade.

U.S.-TRADE:  NAFTA ASSAILED ON SECOND ANNIVERSARY

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- U.S. fans of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are not celebrating.
   Two years after the highly-touted accord between the United
States, Canada, and Mexico, NAFTA has become a political liability
and given ammunition to critics of similar free trade agreements.
   Symptomatic was a cartoon appearing in today's New York Times
which depicted two men in a seedy-looking room in an urban
neighborhood. Across the street a decrepit apartment house is being
consumed by flames. One of the men is seated on a sofa reading a
newspaper's help-wanted classified advertisements. The page is
lined with the logos of fast-food joints like McDonalds and
Wendy's.
   His friend, who has just walked in the door with a bottle of
tequila, shouts, "Good news! Tequila is a dollar cheaper." The
caption below reads "NAFTA finally pays off."
   "Our predictions have proved correct; if anything, the situation
has worsened," declared William Bywater, president of the main U.S.
Electronics Workers' Union (IUE) and one of NAFTA's staunchest foes
on the pact's first anniversary.
   "The collapse of the Mexican economy, the increase in drug
traffic, the flood of illegal immigrants, the loss of jobs in the
U.S., and now the most recent specter of unsafe Mexican trucks on
our highways have proved that we were right (in opposing NAFTA),"
he said.
   He was referring to the latest, and biggest, roadblock in the
implementation of NAFTA, the mid-December decision by the
administration of President Bill Clinton to indefinitely delay the
liberalization of trucking rules that would have permitted U.S. and
Mexican truckers to operate more than 30 kilometers beyond each
others' borders.
   The new rules were to have taken effect this month but pressure
from the powerful Teamsters Union apparently persuaded the
administration to place "greater emphasis on safety and security"
for U.S. roadways. The administration has not yet indicated when
those concerns might be cleared up.
   Citing trade experts, the Washington Post said the decision, the
first major failure of NAFTA's implementation, showed "how eager
the administration is to reduce NAFTA's unpleasant political
fallout, even by circumventing rules of an accord President Clinton
championed."
   But it's not only Clinton's political base that is unhappy.
Pulled by television pundit and presidential hopeful Patrick
Buchanan, Republicans, too, have moved against NAFTA.
   Historically one of the most devoted free trade advocates in a
free trade party, Republican presidential front-runner Sen. Robert
Dole came out three months ago against the consideration of any new
trade pacts this year. With that remark, he effectively buried 45
years of staunch Republican support for any measure that would open
up foreign markets to U.S. goods and investment.
   He also buried the hopes of Caribbean Basin nations of achieving
parity with NAFTA benefits and of Chile for becoming the first
non-North American nation to be admitted to NAFTA this year. Given
the sensitivity of the issue in next year's presidential election,
those hopes are probably dead for next year as well.
   NAFTA supporters say all this is unfair. During its first year,
NAFTA had produced unprecedented gains in two-way trade for both
the United States and Mexico which, after all, was the reason for
its approval.
   The problem, they insist, was something completely unrelated to
the trade pact: the melt-down of the peso which began last December
when the incoming administration of Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo botched a devaluation.
   "Nonsense," say the foes, many of whom had warned that the peso
was kept deliberately overvalued during the NAFTA debate in the
U.S. Congress in late 1993 so as not to give ammunition to critics
who warned that inevitable devaluations would spur the flight of
capital and factories southwards.
   Whatever the relationship between the peso's collapse and NAFTA,
critics are now having a field day pointing to all of the broken
promises made by NAFTA's boosters two years ago.
   Clinton, for example, predicted that NAFTA would create 200,000
U.S. jobs in its first two years. In fact, Gary Hufbauer of the
Institute for International Economics, the economist on whom the
White House relied for Clinton's estimate, now admits that the
United States has probably lost about 225,000 jobs net.
   Indeed, Mexico is expected to end up with a trade surplus with
the United States this year of around $20 billion. U.S. exports to
Mexico have fallen to about their pre-NAFTA levels and, as yet,
show few signs of levelling off.
   Similarly, a new report to be released by the consumer group
Public Citizen and the Mexico City-based Red Mexicana de Accion
Frente al Libre Comercio (RMALC) finds that another major promise
of the NAFTA campaign, that public health and environmental
problems along the U.S.-Mexico border would be improved as a result
of NAFta, have been dashed.
   The 85-page report finds that "NAFTA has intensified severe
problems of water and air polution, hazardous waste dumping and
increased the incidence of certain diseases and birth defects in
the border region," according to Joan Claybrook, Public Citizen's
president.
   In spite of administration predictions that NAFTA-related
investments would disperse industry in Mexico away from the border
to other regions, the maquiladoras which dominate border
enterprises have been one of the few sectors to experience a major
boom over the past two years.
   The maquiladora workforce has grown 20 per cent since NAFTA took
effect, according to the new report, at the same time that an
estimated 1.6 million Mexicans have lost their jobs as a result of
the economic crisis. More than 85 per cent of the maquiladora
workers were employed near the border.
   Worse, the economic crisis in Mexico has greatly reduced the
ability of the country's state and federal health and environmental
authorities to deal with the increased industrial concentration
ccording to the report.

HONG KONG:  COUNTDOWN TO HANDOVER ENTERS CRUCIAL PHASE

Analysis by Yojana Sharma
   HONG KONG, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The countdown to the handover of Hong
Kong to China has entered what is arguably its most crucial phase
with Beijing having handpicked its team to steer the colony through
the final 18 months of British rule.
   A preparatory committee of Hong Kong businessmen, academics,
politicians and other public figures was officially approved by
China's Parliament, the National People's Congress, last week.
   Together with high-ranking Chinese officials, led by foreign
minister Qian Qichen, they are expected to move quickly to set in
place an embryo administration that will take charge on July 1,
1997, when this vibrant economy becomes a Special Administrative
Region of China.
   The formation of the Preparatory Committee, which has the
blessing of Britain under the terms of the handover treaty signed
by Britain and China in 1984, "signifies the formal start of giving
up power by the British administration here," says Terry Cheng,
editor of the daily Hong Kong Standard.
   From now on, says Cheng, "things will move very fast and the
political environment will be quite changed by the end of the year
(1996)."
   The Committee is expected to begin its work almost immediately.
Its most important task is seen as the election by mid-year by a
committee executive of Hong Kong's first post-1997 governor, to
replace Chris Patten, the 28th and last British governor of Hong
Kong.
   A short-list of names is already thought to have been drawn up
by the Chinese authorities. The naming of the Governor-designate
will be an important milestone, analysts say.
   The governor-in-waiting will then pick his Executive Council,
bringing out into the open the nature of the first post-1997
government. "The candidates will have an important bearing on the
future running of the territory," noted Cheng.
   However, some analysts say there will be few surprises with such
a small number of Hong Kong people appointed to the Committee. Hong
Kong figures wanting to be appointed to the Committee are already
jockeying for position.
   In particular, several delegations of business tycoons, many of
them with business interests in China, visited Beijing in recent
weeks to meet top Chinese officials and lobby for a place on the
Committee. Many of them succeeded, sparking strong criticism that
the Committee is heavily skewed towards the business sector with
entire sectors of the Hong Kong population completely
unrepresented.
   No members of Hong Kong's pro-democracy Democratic Party, which
swept the Legislative Council polls in September, have been
appointed, leading to criticism that the Committee is packed with
"yes-men" who will do Beijing's bidding rather than stand up for
Hong Kong's interests.
   Hong Kong legislator Dr. Leong Che-Hung wonders how many Hong
Kong representatives on the committee "can claim to represent Hong
Kong people? How many have actually spoken the mind of Hong Kong
people in the past? Paradoxically, records have shown that many of
them have spoken or even acted against the wishes of Hong Kong
people."
   Defending China's decision to exclude the Democrats, Hong Kong
legislator and Committee member David Chu said the Committee needed
to work smoothly.
   "The Chinese government will appoint people who can work with
China. There is just over a year to prepare the transition (to
Chinese rule) and the volume of work is quite big and some of the
work quite controversial," he said.
   The vast majority of appointees have already sat on a
consultative body set up by China known as the Preliminary Working
Committee (PWC), which wound up in early December to make way for
the Preparatory Committee. The PWC was seen as having little
credibility with the Hong Kong public.
   Meanwhile public opinion polls by three universities conducted
by sociologist Lau Siu Kai, himself appointed to the Committee,
found that Hong Kong people were quickly losing faith in the
political establishment pre- and post-1997.
   Lau said the survey showed people had declining trust in
political institutions and leaders during the transition. "The
power of the British authorities is waning and the legitimacy of
the incoming Chinese authorities has yet to be established," he
said.
   Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, who angered the Chinese with
his democratic reforms for the Colony also criticised the
Committee. "I think that...the lack of representativeness (of the
Committee) expresses China's attitude towards the territory.
   "I think there will inevitably be quite a lot of feeling in Hong
Kong that it's a great pity that China didn't show more trust for
opinion in Hong Kong and wasn't prepared to tap as wide a section
of opinion as possible," Patten told the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC).
   Analysts say that China still has its work cut out for it
shoring up Hong Kong's confidence in the post-1997 government, with
some predicting a mass exodus in 1996 if the future governor and
his team appear to be a self-serving group who will not stand up
to Beijing hardliners.
   "As for the ordinary people...their perception of future travel,
freedom, autonomy and rule of law will determine what course they
will take to cope with the changeover," said Cheng. "Some who have
already secured a right of abode elsewhere will leave next year if
they do not perceive the developments positively."
   Patten also warned: "If Chinese officials of the Preparatory
Committee go on delivering the same sort of shocks that Hong Kong
suffered in the last few months...if people start to doubt whether
Hong Kong really will have a high degree of independence after 1997
then they may decide to go abroad."
   Patten said there was little Britain could now do to reassure
people about the future. "The closer we get to 1997 the more people
will focus on the reality which is that more and more reassurance
is needed from China."
   Indirectly, Patten was also referring to Britain's declining
influence in the last days of its rule, with the Preparatory
Committee expected to be an important power center competing with
the Colonial administration in the final months.
   "The Chinese will have far greater influence on government
decision-making," noted Cheng.
   In particular once the name of the first post-1997 governor is
announced at mid-year, Patten will increasingly be seen as a lame
duck. As Cheng explained, while the post-1997 Governor-designate
and his team "will have no executive power...their views will be
much sought after...for any policy directions for post-1997 Hong
Kong."
   Hong Kong Liberal Party legislator Allen Lee, who was among
those appointed, admitted "at times the authority of the Hong Kong
government would be affected (by the Committee) whether the Hong
Kong government likes it or not."

PHILIPPINES:  NEW YEAR'S REVELRY FATAL FOR SCORES OF FILIPINOS

By Johanna Son
   MANILA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Not only do Filipinos observe the
world's longest Christmas season, they may well have the bloodiest
brand of New Year revelry too.
   For days after Filipinos welcome the New Year with
super-strength firecrackers like "Judas' Belt" and "Hiroshima",
newspapers and television stations keep a tally of people killed
or maimed by pyrotechnics at the height of holiday revelry.
   "Tradition dies hard, as does the stupidity of some people,"
commented Isyu, a popular tabloid that ran a picture of a doctor
working on the mangled hand of a firecracker victim grimacing in
pain.
   By this morning, newspapers reported that at least 23 persons
died and more than 800 persons were injured by firecrackers.
   Holiday fever in the Philippines begins as early as in October
and ends the first Sunday of January, on the Roman Catholic Feast
of the Three Kings. But yuletide celebrations reach their deafening
height on the midnight of Dec. 31.
   On New Year's Eve, emergency rooms of hospitals fill up with
blast and burn victims. Parts of Manila turn into mini-war zones,
where venturing out for a walk or drive is risky. Visibility dips
as smoke from exploded firecrackers engulfs the city.
   At least six people were killed by stray bullets fired by New
Years revellers into the sky, and scores more across the country
hurt by bullets.
   Thirteen fires broke out in the Philippine capital of Manila
during the early hours of Jan. 1, at least three of them started
by firecrackers falling on roofs or into storehouses.
   "Our insistence on exploding big firecrackers and firing guns
to welcome the new year must make other people wonder if we are
really a suicidal and homicidal race," said the Philippine Daily
Inquirer in its editorial today.
   "Or perhaps it is our desire to be the winner in the pyrotechnic
and noise Olympics: the bigger, the noisier, the deadlier, the
better. We do everything to excess, in the process injuring and
sometimes killing ourselves or other people," it added.
   But though the casualty count remained sizable, government
officials took some comfort in that it was considerably lower than
last year's toll.
   Some 4,500 persons were injured last year, many of whom lost
fingers or hands that were blasted away in accidents, by defective
firecrackers or by those powerful enough to sound and hurt like
small bombs. Health department officials attributed the lower
casualty toll to a national campaign to get Filipinos to use other
noisemakers instead of firecrackers.
   "The casualty toll has gone down by up to 50 per cent. Our
program for people to use horns has paid off somewhat," said Health
Secretary Hilarion Ramiro, who went on television to appeal to
people to avoid lighting firecrackers.
   Newspapers and radio stations reminded people to "be merry, not
sorry" during the New Year celebrations. TV stations tried to drive
the message home by running graphic footage of bloodied victims
maimed by firecracker blasts or burns.
   The government in fact made arrangements with more than 50
hospitals to treat up to 5,000 victims, with one hospital
designated as the National Registry for Firecracker-Related
Injuries.
   Largely unable to keep watch over firecracker factories, the
government has in recent years tried to dampen demand for
pyrotechnics by promoting the use of horns and other noisemakers
instead. But one of the most commonly-cited, and perhaps effective,
reasons for the lower casualty count this year has been the rising
cost of pyrotechnics, some of which are smuggled into the country.
Fancy firecrackers can cost well over $35 apiece.
   Members of the Martinez family say its supply of firecrackers
during this New Year's eve was good for only 30 minutes of revelry.
"We cut down because they're really getting expensive," said Danny
Martinez, a businessman.
   "While Filipinos rich and poor have been known to burn their
money, this becomes harder to do and easier to avoid when the
choice gets down to having a good dinner or a few noises," remarked
the Manila Times newspaper.

VENEZUELA-DRUGS:  CRIME BY WOMEN AND CHILDREN INCREASES

By Wilmer Poleo Zarpa
   CARACAS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Carmen Victoria lives in a marginal
neighborhood west of Caracas. She had her first child when she was
16 and her second child two years later. The fathers disappeared.
   Now in her early thirties, Carmen Victoria is an inmate of the
Los Teques women's prison 30 kilometers southwest of the capital.
Her oldest son, Juan Carlos, 16, is also imprisoned in a youth
reformatory. Both are charged with drug-related crimes.
   There are many cases in Venezuela like those of Carmen Victoria
and Juan Carlos, especially in the largest cities such as Caracas,
Maracay, Valencia, Barguisimeto and Maracaibo.
   The phenomenon has begun to cause concern but reliable
statistics about its incidence are not yet available.
   Nerio Rengifo, chief of the Judicial Technical Police's
Anti-Drug Division, acknowledges that the participation of women
and adolescents in criminal activity has grown significantly,
especially in the lower rungs of the illegal drug industry.
   Maribel Rodriguez, a sociologist with the Venezuelan Ministry
of Education, explained that "the country's economic crisis has hit
the population with the fewest resources especially hard."
   "In many families, children and youth find themselves compelled
for one reason or another, to leave school," she added.
   Lack of opportunity for poor children, youths and adults lead
to idleness which may encourage drug consumption or trafficking,
she said. Rodriguez noted the absence of education, sports and
cultural programs to help combat the problem.
   Rengifo agreed with the sociologist and added that much depended
on a child's upbringing and the ties created between parents and
child.
   "The situation is usually worse in poor neighborhoods where the
majority of children grow up parentless or where mothers have
children with different fathers," Rengifo said.
   The police chief said, "The mother must leave the children alone
for the better part of the day while she looks for sustenance."
   To this he added "the dearth of paternal role models to follow"
and a repressed desire for betterment which he says makes the poor
adolescent easy prey for any kind of criminal activity, with role
models found on every street and corner.
   Guillermo Romero, president of the National Commission Against
Illegal Drug Use (Conacuid) and the government's leading authority
on the issue agrees that the nuclear family is the basis for
education in every sense, including learning to reject drugs.
   For that reason, the National Plan for Prevention and Control
of Drug Production, Trafficking and Consumption emphasizes
prevention and the paramount need to actively include the
community, Romero explained.
   Community participation is given priority when developing
information, training and education programs directed toward
preventing drug trafficking and consumption, Romero said.
   The government, police and sociologists all agree that
prevention is the best tool. Commissioner Rengifo insisted that the
problem "will never be solved with repressive policies."
   Police believed that the solution lies in "confronting the lack
of family planning and fighting idleness by increasing activities
in poor neighborhoods," he said
   Conacuid has proposed reformulating all educational programs to
include specific objectives referring to the prevention of drug
trafficking and consumption.
   Romero announced plans for an epidemiological study that will
serve as the basis for the National Plan because it will provide
a better understanding of the general problem and specific
conditions in each neighborhood.
   "Nevertheless, we have to be clear that this is an ethical and
moral problem, a problem for everyone, and that consequently the
solution should be supported by everyone," Romero opined.
   Sociologist Ruth Taborda, who is also with the Ministry of
Education, added that the involvement of minors with drugs requires
stronger action for "preventive intervention in the family, school,
and community."
   Taborda said that she had developed concrete initiatives and
strategies that are broadly divided into a teacher training program
and a program to develop youth activists.
   "Using specific projects, we're seeking to train teachers in
preventive activity and also to develop youth leaders in the
schools," Taborda explained.

PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN:  PROXY WAR TESTS DOMESTIC POLITICS

By Nasim Zehra
   ISLAMABAD, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Determined to be seen as a big player
in Afghanistan, Pakistan has urged President Burhanuddin Rabbani
to smooth the way for talks on resolving the protracted war,
ignoring Rabbani's own unconditional offer for peace parleys.
   Foreign Minister Sardar Assef said in a televised interview over
the weekend that the "prime responsibility" for restoring peace in
Afghanistan rests with Rabbani, and had nothing to say about the
sudden raising of hopes for peace in Afghanistan.
   Afghanistan's beleaguered president last month surprised Afghan
watchers by offering to travel out of his fortified capital to the
strongholds of his rivals for talks to end the fierce battle for
power that has devastated the country.
   The Taliban student militia, who are Rabbani's biggest
challengers, are reported to be considering the offer. After an
expected initial rebuff, they now say they will make a decision
after receiving details.
   Commentators in Islamabad think Assef's silence on Rabbani's
offer may be the result of disquiet in Pakistan over the softening
of rigid stands by Rabbani and the Taliban. In Afghanistan's ethnic
power struggle, Pakistan is on the side of the Taliban who swept
out of seminaries in Pakistan in 1994 to threaten Rabbani's control
of Afghanistan.
   Islamabad's support for the student militants has strained its
previously cozy relations with Iran, which has thrown its
considerable weight behind Rabbani. Afghanistan is at the center
of a regional proxy war between neighbors bent on increasing their
presence in the strategic area.
   The Taliban control 11 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces, and since
October have laid siege to Kabul. Afghanistan's historic capital
has been nearly completely destroyed in the war that erupted a few
months after mujahiddin forces ousted the pro-communist government
of Najibullah in April 1992.
   Rival factions trained on each other the stockpiles of
sophisticated arms and ammunition supplied by the United States via
Pakistan during the mujahiddin's 12-year war with the Afghan
government.
   Now fighting for control are the Persian-speaking
Tajik-controlled government of Rabbani ranged against the Uzbek
warlord General Rashid Dostam, the ethnic Pushtoon Hizbul Islami
chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and the Taliban student warriors.
   On Dec. 30, eight Afghan civilians were killed and 41 injured
when a deadly new wave of shells and rockets smashed into Kabul
from Taliban positions on Kabul's fringes. The International
Committee of the Red Cross estimates factional fighting in and
around Kabul has killed more than a quarter million people.
   Tens of thousands of civilians have fled Kabul and many are
living in refugee camps in Pakistan's north and northwest.
Tolerated earlier, they are increasingly being viewed as a threat
to internal security in Pakistan.
   A wave of bomb attacks in Pakistan -- the worst being the blast
in Peshawar on Dec. 21 and the bombing of the Egyptian Embassy in
Islamabad on Nov. 19 -- are believed to be the fallout of
Afghanistan's lingering civil war.
   Political observers warn of worsening law and order because of
Pakistan's proxy military intervention in Afghanistan. While there
is no conclusive evidence, the involvement of the Rabbani regime
in master-minding some attacks is also suspected. In September,
Pakistan's embassy in Kabul was razed to the ground.
   Hardliners are campaigning for a military retaliatory attack on
the Afghan government. "Pakistan should attack Rabbani's military
target to teach a lesson," said Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, chairman
of the Kashmir Committee, at a press conference.
   In his opinion, this would be acceptable to the world community
which has not demurred when Israel's military attacked Hezbollah
targets in south Lebanon. They are not attacks of aggression but
for the protection of its citizens, he explained.
   However, as its response, Pakistan has only expelled the
Peshawar-based member of the Afghan Council, Moosa Khan, and
ordered that all foreign non-governmental groups working with
refugees must be staffed either by their own nationals or by
Pakistanis.
   Pakistan is awash with weapons and explosives, and it is
virtually impossible for the security forces to control the flow
of arms and men across its borders. Many militant Islamic groups
abroad have originated in Pakistan.
   Like the Taliban who have learned their lessons in warfare in
southwestern Baluchistan province, Islamic groups from Algeria to
Sudan and Egypt have roots in Pakistan's religious seminaries.
During the war conducted by Afghan mujahiddin against the
Soviet-backed Kabul regime, they received training in warfare and
the handling of explosives.
   Meanwhile, the Benazir Bhutto government in Islamabad has been
cracking down on the religious right to change Pakistan's image
abroad as a breeding ground for Islamic militants. Islamic radicals
last week expressed their outrage by calling a nationwide strike
against the government, accusing it of being un-Islamic.
   Liberal Pakistanis worry about an Islamic takeover. The fears
were heightened by disclosures about an abortive coup planned in
September last year by a group of fundamentalist officers in the
Pakistan army.

CAMEROON-AGRICULTURE:  FARMERS AND CATTLE-OWNERS CLASH OVER LAND

by Tansa Musa
   BAMENDA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The administrator of Wum, in
north-western Cameroon, had barely settled down to a day's work
when 150 women from a neighboring village began chanting protest
songs outside his office demanding the release from detention of
one of their kith and kin.
   Ekom David Achuo, the husband of one of the demonstrating women,
had earlier caught four cows that had devoured three-quarters of
his crop and marched them to the local police station, demanding
an investigation and compensation from the animals' owner. Instead
the police beat him up and detained him the whole day.
   Rather than freeing Achuo, the administrator ordered the women
away. Angrily they tore off their clothes, a common form of
ultimate protest among African women, at which the official fled.
   "We've had enough of this," fumed the leader of the group of
women. "They (the administration) have taken all our land and given
it to the Bororos (mainly cattle grazers in the region)."
   "Now we have no more land to farm on. Even when we grow crops
on what is left, they send their cows to destroy everything. And
each time we complain, the administration does nothing about it,"
she added.
   Wum, like most of the province, has been the scene of
increasingly violent conflicts over the past two decades between
farmers and immigrant cattle grazers.
   The competition has been inflamed by unregulated farming and
grazing, rapid population growth, and alleged bias on the part of
the local administration.
   Cattle rearing was first introduced to this primarily farming
area by Nigerian Fulani nomads (also known as Bororos) in the
1930's. In time, cattle became a sign of wealth even among locals.
   Northwestern Cameroon is mainly rough, hilly terrain and only
five per cent of the land is arable. The problem has been
compounded by shifting cultivation, a common practice among local
farmers whereby they exploit an area of land for three years, then
move onto another, leaving the first one fallow.
   In an area with no industries where 95 per cent of the
population of 1.8 million depend on subsistence agriculture, the
pressure on the land has reached the point of violence between
cultivators and cattle owners.
   According to Ali Tal, an agricultural expert here, farmer-grazer
disputes are a headache for both agricultural and veterinary
(livestock) services.
   Amos Chanji of the provincial livestock service in Bamenda
believes the solution lies in better land use by farmers and better
ranching by cattle breeders. But Ali says efforts to teach
sustainable farming and land use for high altitudes have failed.
   "We are quite aware that there is a shortage of land here," says
Dr. Idrissou Bapetel, veterinary officer for Wum. "We have tried
to demarcate grazing land from farm land. But nobody, neither the
farmer nor the grazer, respects the demarcation line. So we're
caught in between the two. We just don't know what to do."
   The clashes here have occasionally led to loss of property or
even life.
   Three months ago, a man stabbed during a fight with a
cattle-owner near his farm died in the hospital; in Ndu, part of
the neighboring Donga-Mantung Division, a herder burned down a hut
holding a farmer's harvest for the whole year when the farmer's
children stoned his cows for eating their crops.
   The violence has been attributed to the way in which
administrators have resolved the clashes. Often the Bororos, who
are usually richer than the farmers, bribe administrators in cash
or cattle to rule in their favor.
   Residents of Wat in Donga-Mantung say one major cattle-owner
comes before the courts at least six times a year, but always
emerges victorious.
   "All he needs to do is give the divisional officer one of his
many cows and the case is settled," a resident told IPS. But
administrators vehemently deny this.
   "You know, in this situation it is difficult to satisfy the two
sides. We try to let them understand that the two communities must
live together. The society needs the crops of the farmers as well
as the cattle the grazers raise. So the two must cohabit," says
James Yega, deputy divisional officer for Wum.
   Yega blames most of the problems on farmers who consider
themselves the original owners of the land: "They say the Bororos
are strangers encroaching on their land...But these people
(Bororos) are also Cameroonians and have equal access to land."

EAST ASIA-POLITICS:  IN JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, PUBLIC LOSING FAITH

Analysis by Suvendrini Kakuchi
   TOKYO, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Corruption at the highest levels in
politics and business in Japan and South Korea is nothing new, say
analysts. It was ignored or tolerated by East Asian populations
riding a wave of more than a decade of rapid economic growth.
   Not so anymore. In a less economically vibrant Japan and a more
politically open South Korea, corruption is no longer viewed as a
necessary evil. Indeed, it is seen as an obstacle to future
development -- hence the emphasis on change by the government
leaders of both countries in their New Year messages yesterday.
   "Setting straight the historical record in order to rectify past
wrongs will be a starting point in which we should take pride and
it will also signal the birth of a new society," said South Korea
President Kim Young Sam.
   He has vowed to leave no stone unturned to bring the guilty to
justice with regard to corruption and coup-related incidents for
which two former presidents and several leading businessmen have
been arrested and indicted over the past few months.
   In Tokyo, where the government has been rocked by a series of
financial scandals, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama spent
much time on his government's plans to deregulate the economy in
such a way that bureaucrats would no longer have carte blanche over
the disbursement of public funds.
   "By promoting structural reform, deregulation and
liberalization, the outlook for the economy will be bright this
year," Murayama said in his New Year message yesterday.
   Both leaders urged public understanding as they try to make up
for past mistakes. They have to, say analysts, who feel the
scandals have threatened to undermine years of economic
development.
   The Japanese population is just about fed up with the political
establishment, commented Japan's Yomuiri Shimbun newspaper in an
editorial after last month's arrest of former labor minister Toshio
Yamaguchi.
   He faces charges of using his former position to secure 1.9
billion yen ($19 million) in illegal loans from the now defunct
Tokyo Kyowa Credit Association and Anzen Credit Bank to help
relatives set up businesses that until recently raked in huge
profits.
   Not surprisingly, the Japanese public reacted with outrage when
the 60-year-old Yamaguchi refused to answer questions from
prosecutors and even evoked his special parliamentary immunity,
forcing the government to endorse his arrest at the last moment.
   Yamaguchi, deputy secretary of the reformist New Frontier Party,
continues to deny any wrongdoing, but in the eyes of a public tired
by reports of impropriety regarding present and former government
officials he is already deemed guilty, noted the newspaper Asahi
Shimbun.
   Asahi Shimbun also expects that an even bigger scandal,
involving the New York branch of the Daiwa Bank, will also see
those accused found guilty of mismanagement.
   Last week, that bank's former manager Masahiro Tsuda was
indicted by a New York court on charges of defrauding the U.S.
Federal Reserve by concealing $1.12 billion of trading losses.
   In November, Federal and New York State banking regulators
ordered Daiwa to close its operations in the United States after
a grand jury accused banking officials of illegally covering up
huge trading losses.
   The scandals have dealt a severe blow to Japan's image and much
of the heat has in turn been focused on the finance ministry for
failing to put adequate controls in place to preempt the illegal
activity.
   The resignation of the ministry's top-ranking bureaucrat,
administrative vice-finance minister Kyosuke Shin, is a reflection
of the turmoil caused by the bad-loan scandals, including the
mammoth bad debt problem faced by housing loan companies.
   "I have decided to step down to let some fresh air into the
ministry as 1996 starts, at a time when the morale of ministry
officials has been shaken by a series of incidents," he said in his
resignation letter, which was accepted Dec. 29 by Finance Minister
Masayoshi Takemura.
   Shinozawa, whose resignation becomes effective on Dec. 29, said
his resignation should not be seen in the light of a failing on his
part with regard to any particular "incident."
   Last month, the ministry unveiled a plan to spend billions of
dollars in public funds to shore up bankrupt housing loan
companies. Economic analysts applaud the initiative, but the
taxpayers are not enthusiastic about having to foot the bill for
the ministry's mistakes.
   Observers expect the government will try to put a lid on the
scandal by announcing reshuffles within the ministry. This,
however, may not be acceptable in today's Japan where unemployment
hit a post-war high of 3.4 per cent in November.
   According to Tokyo Business Today, a leading magazine on Japan's
economy, politics and business have deep-rooted bonds in Japanese
society -- ties forged for mutual gain.
   "Money is not the only reward enjoyed by politicians who do
favors for companies," said the magazine. "Electoral support also
plays a major part in the relationship. At election time companies
mobilize people, materials and money in support of the right sort
of politician."
   The business magazine says corruption goes deeper, with
politicians campaigning for large budget allocations for certain
ministries "expecting in turn to be accommodated (by bureaucrats)
when they put in a word for a favored company at contract time."
   Analysts in Seoul say that in South Korea corruption is
similarly rampant, adding that the political upheavals now rocking
the country should not be viewed only in the context of the coup
trials now taking place.
   The coup trials involve former South Korean president Roh Tae
Woo and his predecessor, who led the nation in the 1980's. They
have been arrested and charged for crimes ranging from bribery to
insurrection.
   Roh, South Korea's first elected president and often considered
the main instigator of democratic reform after decades of military
rule, is under arrest for accumulating a $6.5 million slush fund
from top business leaders.
   But just as in Japan, those arrested remain defiant in the face
of public disenchantment. Such is the case with Chun, one of the
nation's most formidable military dictators, who went on a hunger
strike to protest his arrest. He is now in hospital.
   Japanese and South Korean leaders find it difficult to accept
fault for their actions because they have become so accustomed to
a system which has earlier been considered part and parcel of East
Asian economic development.
   South Korea's now dynamic conglomerates enjoy state protection
through subsidies and regulations. In return it has been the
practice to handsomely reward politicians, who use the money to
finance their political campaigns.
   Meanwhile the economy has prospered, creating jobs -- one reason
why no fuss was made. Another reason is that the political
establishment used to be less open to criticism.
   "The power of a democratically awakened people has a lot to do
with the impending fate of the two former presidents awaiting
justice," South Korean analyst Mary B. Kim wrote in The Korea
Herald.
   Both Roh and Chun have been indicted on charges of corruption
and instigating a 1979 military coup that eventually carried them
to power.
   "To see these politicians in prison garb is a tremendous blow
to the nation's confidence," said Mary B. Kim. "The only way South
Koreans can redeem their loss is by hoping the current crisis will
clean the bad, old system."

DEVELOPMENT:  THIRD WORLD GROWTH SLOW OVER LAST DECADE

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 (IPS) -- Despite a decade of reform, most
Third World economies grew at a per capita rate of only one per
cent or less from 1985 through 1994, according to the latest
edition of the World Bank's annual Atlas.
   Considered as a region, African economies performed the worst
over the decade, with Cameroon claiming last place with a per
capita growth rate of minus 6.6 per cent. But Nicaragua's economy
also declined dramatically, at a rate of minus 6.4 per cent.
   Declines in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were in
many cases even more dramatic, with growth rates ranging from minus
0.9 per cent for Hungary and Poland to minus 18.6 per cent for
Georgia.
   Western industrialized economies, on the other hand, grew at a
fairly consistent rate of between one and two per cent, although
Sweden turned in zero per capita growth over the decade and
Finland's economy dipped at a 0.3 per cent per capita rate during
the ten years.
   As expected, the decade's star performers were Asian, with
Thailand turning in the strongest per capita growth rate of 8.2
per cent, followed by South Korea at 7.8 per cent, and China and
Singapore both at 6.9 per cent.
   Botswana, the African leader, was next with a rate of 6.6 per
cent. Highest in Latin America was Chile, with a 6.2 per cent per
capita growth rate.
   The Atlas, a yearly publication which contains a wealth of
statistical data on education, health, environmental quality,
energy use, and economic performance, notes wide disparities
between rich and poor nations.
   For example, the average citizen of Luxembourg, rated as the
world's richest country and with a per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) of $39,845, is almost 500 times richer than his
Mozambican counterpart, whose per capita GDP share of $80 is the
world's lowest.
   Using a different criterion called purchasing power parity (PPP)
which measures the purchasing power in each country in equivalent
U.S. dollars, the gap comes out somewhat smaller. Luxembourg's per
capita PPP is $31,090, while Mozambique's is about $550.
   In 1993, Luxembourg's energy consumption was 9,879 kilograms of
oil equivalent per person. That was about 1,400 times more than the
energy usage in the country at the other extreme, Somalia, whose
citizens consumed the equivalent of only seven kilograms of oil
that year.
   Indeed, Africa remains by far the poorest continent in the world
in almost every respect. Sierra Leone has the highest infant
mortality rate, with 164 children of every thousand succumbing
during their first year of life. In Japan and Sweden, which have
the lowest rates, only four and five children of every thousand,
respectively, die before their first birthday.
   Sierra Leone also had the lowest average life expectancy at
birth -- only 39 years. A cluster of other African nations and
Afghanistan averaged in the mid-40s. In contrast, the average life
expectancy for people in developed countries rose from 71 in 1970
to 77 in 1993.
   The Atlas argues that education and high economic growth are
linked. Botswana, China, Indonesia, Korea and Singapore -- all with
growth rates of over six per cent over the past decade -- have 96
per cent or more of their primary-age children enrolled in school.
   Despite Africa's relative poverty, child malnutrition is
generally worse in South Asia. As measured by the percentage which
is found to be underweight, 68 per cent of the children in
Bangladesh are malnourished, as are 63 per cent of Indian children;
50 per cent of Nepalis and 40 per cent of Pakistanis fall into the
malnourished category.
   Forty-six per cent of the children of Indonesia, one of the
Bank's star performers, were also found to be malnourished, as were
42 per cent of Vietnamese children.
   But the Bank does not have similar statistics on most of the
world's countries, including much of Africa, the Middle East, and
the former Soviet republics.
   The Atlas also discloses that in most parts of the world women
make up more than 30 per cent of the formal work force, but that
in 20 predominantly Muslim countries, they amount to less than 20
per cent. In Bangladesh, women make up only eight per cent of the
work force.

ENVIRONMENT:  GREEN CONVENTIONS YET TO PROVE EFFECTIVE

By Pratap Chatterjee
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The good environmental news for 1996
is that industrialized countries yesterday halted the production
of chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals that destroy the
mantle of ozone which surrounds the planet, protecting it from the
sun's harmful ultra-violent radiation.
   The bad environmental news for 1996 is that the production of
carbon dioxide, another major contributor to the warming of the
planet, is much higher than predicted.
   Does this mean that the ozone layer is improving even as global
warming is getting worse? Not so far. Preliminary data for 1995
show that both the ozone layer and the global climate have fared
worse than expected.
   This is despite the fact that two international environmental
laws, the 1987 Montreal Protocol for Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer and the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change,
have been in place for some time to prevent these very
environmental disasters .
   "In an ideal world, the good news would be just so. But climate
change and ozone depletion are not isolated phenomona. More carbon
dioxide warms the lower atmosphere and causes higher ozone
depletion," says Kalee Kreider from Ozone Action, a
Washington-based environmental group.
   Many companies have substituted ozone-depleting CFCs with
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). But both chemicals contribute to global
warming.
   "Conventions work to eliminate specific chemicals.
Unfortunately, the real world is complex and interactive so
progress on one chemical can be canceled out by increased
production of another chemical," adds Kreider.
   Scientists from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Agency
(NASA) say that the data from 2,000 land-based weather-monitoring
stations around the world show that 1995 was the hottest year of
the 130 years for which information is available.
   Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported
in September that the seasonal "hole" that opens up in the ozone
layer over Antarctic at the winter's end was roughly the area of
Europe, twice the previous year's size.
   This is about the same size as the hole that was opened up the
year that Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines. Scientists
blamed a rapid increase in the size of the ozone hole that year on
the ash and gases released by the volcano and predicted that the
hole would soon return to a more normal size.
   Scientists say that the problem with any prediction is that
there are numerous assumptions involved, many of which often turn
out to be wrong.
   Activists say that the latest data also show that global
conventions are useless without effective regulation and
enforcement.
   Take global warming. In 1992, governments signed an agreement
in Rio de Janiero to voluntarily cut back on the burning of fossil
fuels, which produces carbon dioxide, to bring national emission
levels down to those of 1990.
   That relatively modest goal fell far short of the 60 per cent
cut in greenhouse emissions that scientists have warned is the
minimum necessary to stabilize the global climate.
   But even this target has proven elusive. Preliminary data for
1995 shows that the United States produced 1,418 million metric
tons of carbon emissions, 5.5 per cent more than it produced in
1990.
   Skip Laitner, of the Virginia-based American Council for an
Energy Efficient Economy, wrote recently that much of the target
could have been met easily if U.S. consumers had invested more in
energy-efficient appliances and vehicles.
   "The lagging efficiency gains are all the more ironic since
earlier studies have shown that meeting the international goals
will increase both employment and economic productivity," he says.
   But energy efficiency alone is not enough to check carbon
emissions. Although fuel efficiency for U.S. cars rose from 5.7
kilometers to 8.9 kilometers to the liter between 1969 and 1990,
auto carbon emissions failed to come down.
   Partly because of the associated cost-saving, U.S. drivers drove
2.4 trillion kilometers in 1990, 50 per cent more than the
1.6.trillion kilometers they logged in 1969. That pushed total fuel
consumption from 242 billion to 273 billion liters.
   The United States is not the only country to miss the targets.
Analysts say that Japan's carbon emissions will exceed their 1990
levels by 5.75 per cent in the year 2000.
   The Canadians have already announced that they will miss the
target by 10 per cent, while unpublished memos from the European
Union show that it expects to be off by six to eight per cent.
   The problems with fulfilling the climate change convention are
two-fold. First, the convention is voluntary; second, governments
continue to pay out large subsidies to industries that rely on
fossil fuels. The United States estimates that its subsidies for
fossil fuels amount to between $10 billion and $15 billion
annually. Estimates for global subsidies range as high as $230
billion a year.
   Or take the depletion of the ozone layer. Yesterday, companies
in industrialized countries officially stopped all production of
CFCs to comply with the Montreal protocol.
   The problems with fulfilling this convention are also two-fold.
First, the ban does not cover consumption. The result is a thriving
smuggling racket.
   CFC smuggling is already making headlines. Last month, the
United States asked Costa Rica to extradite former Miami resident
Bruce Burrell, who was arrested in San Jose for allegedly trying
to smuggle 19,000 cylinders of CFCs into the U.S.
   U.S. government spies working on a covert operation called
"Operation Cool Breeze" discovered that an estimated five to ten
thousand tons of CFCs are being smuggled in to this country each
year.
   Second, CFC substitutes, like HFCs, which are favored by
industry, also have an ozone-depleting effect.
   This means that companies like Maytag and Sanyo continue to
market refrigerators that deplete the ozone. It also means that
companies like Dupont can buy and stockpile CFCs from
non-industrialized countries, which have another ten years to
phase-out CFCs under the Montreal accord.
   "What this shows is that nothing short of a global ban and
strong regulation will work," says Kreider.

U.S.-MEXICO:  CITIZENS' GROUP DEPLORES NAFTA FAILURES ON BORDER

   WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Citizens' groups in both the United
States and Mexico are criticizing the failure of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to improve public health and the
environment along the two countries' border.
   In a new report released here today, the Washington-based Public
Citizen organization and the Red Mexicana de Accion Frente al Libre
Comercio (RMALC) of Mexico City claim that promises by backers of
the two-year-old free trade deal that the border would be cleaned
up under the agreement have been betrayed.
   "Not only is NAFTA not meeting these promises," said Public
Citizen president Joan Claybrook, a top consumer official in the
administration of former president Jimmy Carter. "It has actually
made conditions worse than before it took effect two years ago."
   The 100-page report, entitled "NAFTA's Broken Promises: The
Border Betrayed", provides data on trends in the concentration of
maquiladora industries in the border area, air and water pollution,
hazardous waste, and birth defects attributable to environmental
causes over the past two years.
   Based on published records and interviews with more than one
hundred experts and government officials, the report says that the
promise of improved border conditions relied on three developments.
   It was expected that the maquiladoras would move away from the
border area into Mexico's interior, and that citizens and state
and local governments in the area would become wealthier given the
expected increase in two-way trade enabling them to devote more
money to environmental clean-up and better health enforcement.
   The optimistic predictions were also based on the belief that
strong agencies created under NAFTA would also improve enforcement
of environmental laws.
   But none of these assumptions has been realized, according to
the report.
   The dispersion of maquiladora industries was, according to the
administration of President Bill Clinton, one of the principal aims
of the accord. These industries, mostly assembly plants, not only
bring workers into already-crowded areas, but they also put strains
on natural resources, like water, and use chemicals which
contribute to water and air pollution.
   "If NAFTA is not implemented incentives will continue under the
maquiladoras to locate facilities in the border areas, thus
exacerbating environmental pressures on the border, such as loss
of habitat, adverse impacts to endangered and threatened species,
and reductions in groundwater levels," according to one
administration briefing paper.
   But contrary to that prediction, the new report says that the
maquiladora work force has actually grown by 20 per cent over the
last two years, from 546,000 to almost 700,000.
   The increase in maquiladora employment, according to the report,
is especially remarkable, given the fact that over the past year
some 1.6 million Mexicans have lost their jobs as a result of the
peso's collapse and the tight, anti-inflationary policy followed
by the government of President Ernesto Zedillo.
   "As NAFTA opponents had predicted, the increased industrial
concentration has only intensified air and water pollution, dumping
of hazardous waste, and, most tragically, the rate of disease
associated with environmental degradation, including Hepatitis-A,
cholera and birth defects," said Lori Wallach who directs Public
Citizen's Global Trade Watch.
   As to the improvement of resources to deal with the pollution
and better regulate industries in the border area, the collapse of
the Mexican peso has meant huge cutbacks in spending by both
Mexico's federal and local governments. Mexican Foreign Secretary
Jose Angel Gurria has said that Mexico has put on hold
participation in border environmental projects because of the
economic crisis, according to the report.
   At the same time, the Republican-led U.S. Congress has also cut
funding for border programs, while the World Bank has rearranged
its loan portfolio to Mexico to the detriment of environmental
programs.
   The result is that while private investment in the border area
has risen sharply since NAFTA took effect, both public investment
and the resources needed to ensure that the public's interest in
the environmental quality of the area and the health of its
citizens have fallen, according to the report.
   Nor have the new NAFTA-related institutions, mainly the
Commission on Environmental Cooperation, the Border Environmental
Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American Development
Bank (NADBank) even begun to fill the vacuum.
   The Commission, for example, has not yet heard a single case
involving the failure of the Mexican government to enforce its
environmental laws, while the NADBank, established to provide
low-interest loans for water and waste-treatment in border
communities, has yet to make its first loan.
   Nor is its director, Alfredo Phillips Olmedo, very optimistic
that the situation will change soon. "We have come to the
conclusion that it will be a more difficult process than originally
expected for the bank to engage in substantial lending operations
in the short term," he recently told a public meeting.
   Public Citizen is calling for passage of the NAFTA
Accountability Act, a bill recently introduced by two prominent
Democratic foes of the trade pact. It calls for renegotiating key
parts of NAFTA.

CUBA-ECONOMY:  NO READJUSTMENT WITHOUT BANKING REFORM

By Dalia Acosta
   HAVANA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The tidal wave of radical change in Cuba
will go full steam ahead in the new year with government plans for
deep banking reform to consolidate the economic readjustment.
   The renewal, cooked up by the National Bank of Cuba (BNC), would
do away with the state monopoly on banking, resurrecting structures
which were seen as "un-socialist" for more than 30 years.
   BNC president Francisco Soberon said a banking system is needed
to offer rapid, secure and effective payment, channeling savings
to where they can be most efficiently used and guarantee the
functioning of the economy.
   Specialist sources said that the market economy, adopted
gradually, will force the nation to play a competitive financial
game which will be impossible to win if all the power is in one
pair of hands.
   The decentralization process began to gain ground two years ago
when the currency reserves reached rock bottom, forcing the
government to search around for loans and financing for the
investments.
   The first sign of the process really getting underway was the
creation of the International Bank of Commerce Ltd. (BICSA), in
January 1994, which took over the commercial arm of the BNC and is
today at the core of a budding corporation called New Bank Ltd.
   BNC vice president Jose Rodriquez declared in November that the
new banking group was affiliated to the chain of currency
exchanges, CADECA S.A., the financial novelty with the most impact
for the average Cuban.
   The National Financier Ltd. (FINSA) was also created to provide
more flexible financing for businesses in Cuba, above all in
short-term loans.
   However, the fact that all the new bodies will ultimately be
under the control of the New Bank has raised suspicions among
observers.
   Soberon and other authorities defend the need to separate the
functions of the Central Bank and the Commercial Bank. They want
to see the creation of a Central Bank to control national financial
activity, alongside organisms like the Ministry of Finance and
Prices.
   Specialist sources state that the national banking system has
been forced to diversify its structures in order to respond to
similar changes taking place in the economy.
   The few large state-owned companies which dominated agricultural
production have given way to a mass of more than 3,000 cooperative
basic production units, 1,161 agricultural cooperatives and 86,000
private agricultural producers.
   Any way you look at it, the banking reform will have to plan its
action in order to support the tendency towards self-employed
workers, small, medium-sized and private businesses.
   For the time being, most of the pressure in Cuba is coming from
the changes in foreign trade: the desperate need for credit opened
the nation up to foreign investment and commercial autonomy was
granted to more than 240 national businesses.
   The presence of representatives from 11 foreign banks on the
island has introduced the important ingredient of competition and
revealed the increasing interest awakened by the Cuban economic
changes.
   However, the government is trying to keep control of a chunk of
the internal market of banking business, just as they did with
foreign investment.
   Rodriguez said that "the foreign banks are not authorized to
carry out any banking activity in the country."
   Their role is limited to "promoting the business of the island's
banks," he said, and for the present, "there is no possibility of
giving licenses to any foreign bank to offer other types of
services in Cuba."
   The Spanish Bilbao Vizcaya Bank (BBV) recently opened a branch
in Cuba, offering financing for the Las Tunas area sugar
production, in association with the PEMBA.
   The Netherland Caribbean Bank is also there, along with the
Spanish Exterior Bank, the Sabadel Bank and the Royal Bank of
Canada.
   A party to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the Central Bank
recently was attended by representatives of 120 banks from 45
countries, showing that despite the operative limitations, the
foreign banks are very interested in the Cuban economy.
   BNC workers said that this meeting opened new perspectives for
a solution to the problem of the national foreign debt.
   In the opinion of local economists, foreign debt is one of the
main obstacles to the country entering fully into the capital
market and achieving economic growth. Not counting the money owed
to the former Soviet Union, the foreign debt runs to $8.6 billion.

PANAMA:  THE UNSETTLED ISSUE OF RETRIBUTION

By Silvio Hernandez
   PANAMA CITY, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Six years after the bloody U.S.
invasion in December 1989, the Panamanian people are still pressing
Washington for financial settlement for the death of some 2,500
civilians.
   "We will never forget," reads a notice erected in central Panama
City by the relatives of the dead.
   On Dec. 20, 1989, the United States launched a surprise attack
on Panama City and Colon, with more than 30,000 soldiers, planes,
helicopters and warships, in order to overthrow General Manuel
Noriega.
   The United States has invaded Panama fourteen times since 1856
on the pretext of protecting "vital interests" or U.S. citizens in
the nation.
   President of the Omar Torrijos Foundation, Alma Montenegro,
described this attack as "the most bloody of all (U.S.) invasions
of Panama," and the Secretary General of the National Workers
Center, Elberto Cobos, said that it left "deep wounds in the
national consciousness."
   Demands for justice against the United States, proclamations,
vigils and demonstrations each Dec. 20 "show that those deep wounds
are not healing and will not heal until the US military presence
is ended."
   The 1977 canal treaties dictate that all U.S. troops must be
withdrawn by Dec. 31, 1999, when all the military bases will be
handed over to Panamanian jurisdiction along with the canal itself.
   A controversial petition drawn up by President Bill Clinton last
September, and sent to Panamanian President Ernesto Perez
Balladares proposed "exploring" the possibility of the bases
remaining active.
   Cobos said that "the lesson" the Panamanians received on Dec.
20, 1989 "is that they must strengthen their independence and
consolidate their sovereignty on the basis of the strict fulfilment
of the (1977) treaties."
   Representative of the Committee for the Rescue of Sovereignty,
Paola Herrera, told IPS that "the United States has a
responsibility for the events of Dec. 20 (1989) that cannot be
by-passed."
   Around 200 tradespeople, whose businesses were destroyed by the
invading army, and families of the victims, presented the U.S. with
a demand for $300 million two years ago. Herrera said the demand
had not even been recognized by Washington, and that the amount
claimed was only a fraction of the cost of damage to the Panamanian
State and infrastructure.
   She stressed that the government of former president Guillermo
Endara, who took over the post in a U.S. base in the canal zone
only hours before the invasion, along with the present leader, "are
also responsible for not demanding war reparations."
   She said the U.S. army stole "millions of dollars of equipment
from the old National Defense Forces (once they were defeated),
destroying buildings, offices, and other state structures, and the
government passivity means they have never paid anything back."
   The local justice system, "never called to trial the U.S.
soldiers who committed crimes against unarmed Panamanian civilians,
even though many of them were duly identified."
   Meanwhile, "several members of the old National Defense Forces
are being tried for the death of two gringos (U.S. civilians)," who
died in the invasion.
   The father of Carlos Puga, who died in the invasion, said, "I
have not seen justice for my son...(he) died unarmed at the hands
of the invading forces in an open violation of human rights."
   He described the invasion as "genocide, for which the United
States must be made to pay reparations."
   The 135,000 member National Federation of Public Servants
(FENASEP) has called for the trial of Endara and his vice
presidents, Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford, for being
"accomplices of the 1989 invasion."
   FENESEP spokesman, Maximo Gomez accused the trio of being "the
creators and accomplices of this invasion, proved by the fact that
they took over power in a U.S. base."

MEXICO:  SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS ANNOUNCES ZAPATISTA POLITICAL FRONT

By Eduardo Molina y Vedia
   MEXICO CITY, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Yesterday's announcement that the
Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) will become a national
political front will not necessarily mean an end to guerrilla
tactics, said local experts in Mexico today.
   Zapatista leader "Subcommander Marcos," addressed "the civil,
indigenous, worker, rural worker, religious and non-party
organizations and civil society," in "an act for the transition to
democracy."
   The video was released to coincide with the second anniversary
of the Zapatista uprising two years ago yesterday.
   Political analyst Maria Luz Casal, from the Independent National
University, told IPS that the rebel declaration would mean the
renovation of the Zapatista's political arm the Zapatista National
Liberation Front (FZLN).
   "What has, until today, been the institutional role of the
National Democratic Convention (CND), which was made up of two
assemblies with 6,000 representatives in the insurgent zone, will
now go over to the FZLN," she said.
   The CND had been criticized by the insurgents for its internal
divisions and squabbles, along with its inability to manage mass
mobilizations.
   The CND brought together the smallest left-wing groups along
with the "Church of the poor" and the radical wing of the
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) - a group which won 17 per
cent of the national vote in 1994.
   It also included representatives of indigenous, human
rights,feminist and environmental non-government groups, along with
independent sympathizers.
   Casal said, "the social base will not change when the FZLN
substitutes the CND but they will try and minimize the role of the
preexisting political organizations and strengthen the
organizational function of the rebel leadership."
   Christian Ahuerma of the Workers Movement Studies Center said
the guerrilla declaration "is a new political gesture to indicate
that they are prepared to maintain the situation of detente and
look for new institutional solutions."
   "In fact," he said, "the Zapatistas have been more a political
than military force since they began, though they were
spectacularly catapulted onto the scene in a guerrilla outburst.
   Ever since they came into the public eye on Jan. 1, 1994, in the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas, the Zapatistas had been calling
for a democratic national front.
   After two months of military confrontations in the conflict
zone, the guerrilla and the government agreed to a ceasefire and
an armed truce which led to an arduously slow peace process, still
underway.
   Yesterday's declaration, dubbed the "Fourth Declaration from the
Lacandona Jungle," called for a "peaceful, civil, independent and
democratic, national Mexican organization."
   The FZLN will be part of the year-old National Liberation
Movement (MLN), defined as "a broad opposition force," which
recently established its first principles and plans of action.
   The FZLN "will not be a political party, because it will not
fight to take power, but a civil political force in opposition the
State party system."
   The Zapatistas particularly object to the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has been in power since 1929 and
has suffered a series of scandals in the last year.
   The rebels see the government attitude as "prepotent, racist and
humiliating," and have called for former president Carlos Salinas
to be tried for "treason to the nation."
   They criticized the "defrauding of popular will, the imposition
of the neoliberal model which has plunged the population into
poverty and desperation, the sale of the nation to foreigners and
the close links with narcotraffic."
   The proposal for a political front was established by popular
vote in September when some 300,000 people voted in the "National
poll for peace and democracy" organized by non-governmental groups.
   One of its first actions will be to arrange an "intercontinental
summit against neoliberalism," among the Zapatistas' international
supporters and sympathizers.

JAMAICA-TOURISM:  WINTER SEASON GETS OFF TO BAD START

By Corinne Barnes
   KINGSTON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- It has been only three weeks since the
winter tourist season began but already hoteliers here are wringing
their hands in despair.
   Smaller hotels are on the verge of closing their doors unable
to compete with the might and efficiency of the larger
all-inclusive resorts.
   But the landscape is not bright for all-inclusives either. They
had to offer discounted rates in order to attract the tourist
dollar as competition among the islands in the region becomes more
intense.
   For Jamaica, the winter tourist season means valuable foreign
exchange needed to service external debts and pay the country's
high import bill. Tourism earns this northern Caribbean island some
one billion U.S. dollars each year.
   "Business is bad," says Gale Elmore, owner of a 17-room hotel
in the country's northcoast resort town of Montego Bay.
   Elmore's 40 year old Richmond Hill Hotel is struggling this
season.
   So far this season while all-inclusives are registering
occupancy levels over 70 per cent, the smaller, more intimate
facilities have bookings of 25 per cent.
   One hotel has reported that only four of its 24 rooms are
currently occupied.
   "I have no projections to March, nothing confirmed," says
Anthony Thompson, general manager of the Carib Isle hotel in
Runaway Bay on the north coast.
   "(Business) has not got any better in 15 years," says Thompson.
"Maybe we should really close our doors."
   The non-all inclusive hoteliers complain that they have not been
able to carry out the necessary renovations and advertise their
product effectively to meet this year's winter season as they were
unable to borrow money as interest on loans are becoming
unbearable.
   Interest on loans now stand in the region of 47 per cent.
   President of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association (JHTA)
Lionel Reid who was optimistic at the start of the season says he
is also concerned that unless the situation changes these smaller
hotels may be forced out of business.
   "They (small hoteliers) are operating on bank borrowings and are
now at the wall," he says.
   Reid says it is impossible for these hotels to remain viable
when room rates being charged are what obtained 20 years ago.
   As for Elmore, in order to keep her business open she has had
to strike a deal with the all-inclusive hotels in the area to allow
their guests to eat at her hotel.
   Reid says the situation now existing in the tourism industry is
of concern to the wider population as the ripple effect will be
felt throughout the entire economy.
   If the small hotels are forced to fold, laid off workers are
likely to add to the unemployment level which is hovering at 15
per cent.
   The list of those affected is a long one and includes small
farmers who supply fresh fruits and vegetables to these hotels, and
restaurants and vendors who depend on the non all-inclusive hotel
trade.
   But the fight is not only between the small hotels and the
all-inclusive. Intra-regionally, each island is struggling to fend
off the determined challenge mounted by its neighbors.
   Jamaica, with its high crime rate (779 persons were murdered
last year), is being bypassed by tourists for other islands
perceived as unspoiled and safer.
   The public relations department at the Jamaica Tourist Board
says countries such as the Cayman Islands and Aruba which did not
have a presence in the market three years ago have increased their
profiles through lavish advertising.
   And Cuba which was not considered a serious competitor up to two
years ago has been pumping millions of dollars into its tourism
industry and is expected to lure many visitors to its shores this
year.
   Between January and September 1995, some 68,000 tourists visited
Jamaica. In 1994 the figure stood at 1.5 million, earning some $915
million although projections for that year had been for 1.7 million
with net earnings of $1.1 billion.

BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA:  SERB SEIZURES TEST NATO'S PEACEKEEPING ROLE

By Jim Clark
   SARAJEVO, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- NATO appeared to be in danger of
failing its first major test of effectiveness in holding the
fragile peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as concern grew for the safety
of a group of Bosnian Muslim civilians seized in a Serb-held suburb
of Sarajevo.
   The incident also showed up a potential gap between the
responsibilities of NATO's heavily armed forces and a putative
U.N.-led independent police force in the country. Both forces are
being deployed in the country under the terms of the Dayton Accord
supposed to herald a permanent settlement to the conflict.
   The Bosnian Serbs still control the western districts of
Sarajevo, from where they bombarded the city during the 44 month
war, but which must be handed over to the control of the Muslim-led
Bosnian government. The ten all disappeared yesterday in the suburb
of Ilidza, where opposition to the Dayton pact is strongest.
   Bosnian civilians started to use the main roads out of the city
through the suburbs after members of the 60,000-strong NATO
implementation force (IFOR) removed Serb checkpoints on the
roadways. The seizures stopped the movements.
   "We can confirm that 10 people are missing and we are pressing
the Bosnian Serb authorities to confirm their present location,"
said Colonel Vladimir Ribnikov, chief of the U.N. civilian police
force soon to deploy in Sarajevo.
   Bosnian government minister Hasan Muratovic said the U.N.
figures did not include four others seized yesterday by "Serb
terrorists" on the road from Kiseljak through Ilidza to Sarajevo.
   IFOR officers said they were concerned about the report but said
the responsibility for their safety was a matter for the civilian
authorities.
   NATO is limiting itself to implementing military aspects of the
agreement and plans to leave routine policing to an international
police force intended to tackle civilian problems. The force is yet
to be deployed, and will be under the direction of the High
Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina, former Swedish prime
minister and European Union peace envoy Carl Bildt.
   But who should be responsible when paramilitary forces commit
criminal acts, such as the weekend seizures, has not been defined
as international efforts to grapple with the political aspects of
the accord fall behind schedule.
   NATO officers conceded that they are supposed to ensure freedom
of movement, but still did not consider the activities of
paramilitary groups seizing travellers moving about the city as
their responsibility.
   "We are not a police force, we are not mandated to take police
action," British IFOR spokesman Brigadier Andrew Cumming told a
news briefing in the rebel Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale.
   He attempted to play down the significance of the incidents,
describing today as "another extraordinarily quiet day" in the
(IFOR) theatre of operations. "The parties are continuing to
demonstrate great cooperation and willingness to achieve the goals
of the Dayton agreement," he added.
   The Bosnian Serbs, along with the Muslim-led government promised
to allow full freedom of movement to all citizens throughout Bosnia
when they signed the Dayton peace accord in Paris last month.
   Muratovic told Bosnian TV that an appeal for the unconditional
release of the detained had been issued at a meeting attended by
Serb, government and IFOR officials.
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said the former combatants
had not yet learnt how to deal with each other face to face. "They
have not yet been confronted with dealing with each other. That's
still ahead of them," Perry said at an Italian airbase as he
prepared for a tour of new U.S. encampments in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
   Yet this kind of face to face confrontation is expected to
increase in frequency, especially as members of different
communities try to return to their homes in areas controlled by
former enemies, as specifically guaranteed by the Dayton accord.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today kicked
off their program of refugee return by announcing a top-level
meeting of 40 countries designed to marshal support and assistance
for a massive two-year scheme to see the first of 1.3 million
displaced persons back home in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nearly two
million more have sought refuge in neighboring Croatia, Serbia and
other European countries.
   In theory, IFOR is supposed to ensure that the returns can be
organized in peace, and the U.N. police force is supposed to ensure
general order while they are carried out. IFOR will not step in
unless there is a military threat to civilians.
   An IFOR media briefing in Sarajevo was told yesterday that "the
essence of the IFOR commitment to this theatre, is to wrest
authority away from military, and into the hands of the civilian
authorities."
   However NATO briefing papers say the IFOR mission will "help to
create a secure environment" which includes "assisting in the
observation and prevention of interference with the movement of
civilian populations, refugees and displaced persons."
   The U.N. Security Council approved a U.N. civilian police force
for Bosnia-Herzegovina last month. The 1,700 strong unit of
civilian police officers from around the U.N. member nations will
be responsible for the control and recruitment of local police and
providing them with operational assistance.
   Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said the force will
cost about $90 million in the first six months, will to him but
will "subject to the coordination and guidance" of Bildt.
   Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohammed Sacirbey told a press
conference in Brussels last month that his government was working
out a detailed plan with IFOR for the policing of the Serb suburbs
of Sarajevo.
   "The Bosnian government wants to do all it can to reassure the
people in these areas," he said. "There will be joint police
patrols with the United Nations. There have always been Serbs,
Croats and others, as well as Muslims, in our police force.
   "But," he added, "we have agreed to increase the proportion of
Serbs to 30 per cent or more of the entire police force." It is
expected to be months before this combined force is effectively
operating.
   Until then the informal arrangements must continue, even though
they are already failing in Sarajevo.
   "IFOR was too quick to decide that security was satisfactory,"
said Amir Hafdziomergaic, Muratovic's deputy. "Acts of Serb
terrorism are not going to stop implementation of the Dayton peace
accords, but they risk undermining the conditions in which it takes
place."
   Muratovic said he may order Bosnian police to stop civilians
using the roads unless escorted by IFOR troops. There are no plans
for IFOR convoys to see Sarajevans safely about their own city, as
were sometimes run by the U.N. during the war.

SRI LANKA:  CONSERVATIONISTS BATTLE ECO-TOURISM

By Rita Sebastian
   COLOMBO, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- An unsuspecting deer nibbles at a
plastic bag caught on a prickly bush in Horton Plains, a
picturesque reserve in Sri Lanka's central hills.
   The animal does not know that it is flirting with death. The
non-biodegradable plastic could choke its intestine, leading to a
painful death.
   Jagath Gunewardene of the non-governmental Environmental
Foundation blames the government policy of promotion of eco-tourism
in Sri Lanka for the new problems that park officials are being
forced to contend with. At all times of the year, Horton Plains is
swarming with tourists both local and foreign.
   Dismissing them as nothing but "pleasure seekers," he says that
90 per cent of visitors to the park and similar sanctuaries in Sri
Lanka are insensitive and out to destroy what they have travelled
from far and near to see.
   The authorities have laid down strict rules to prevent visitors
from disturbing the plant and animal life in the park. Photography
at close range is prohibited, but that has not stopped tourists
from hounding the deer for a good shot.
   And by the time the last day tripper goes home, the nature
reserve is littered with the remains of lunch and empty packets of
potato crisps and soft drink bottles.
   Conservationists say Horton Plains was created to preserve a
part of Sri Lanka's tropical beauty for future generations, but the
authorities did not fully take into account man's carelessness and
ability to destroy.
   "There has to be proper policing of tourists and their numbers
must be limited," says Deepthinka Kankanige of the Colombo-based
Society for Environmental Education. On an average some 60 people
visit the park, but even that has been found too many for the staff
whose main job is to safeguard the park.
   About 100 kilometers east of Colombo is Adam's Peak, a mountain
top that is venerated by Sri Lanka's Buddhist people, drawing
millions of devotees on a yearly pilgrimage. Many foreign tourists
to Sri Lanka also scale the peak to catch spectacular views of the
sunrise and the distant blue of the Indian Ocean.
   But the beauty of Adam's Peak may be its ruin. Unregulated camp
sites have sprung up in the wilderness and trees are being stripped
for firewood for bonfires, which are a constant threat specially
during the dry season.
   Kankanige says policing by Forest Department officials would
help, but it is imperative tourist officials educate visitors.
   Buses and private cars reaching Horton's Plain are beset by
souvenir sellers. While a lot of what is sold is bric-a-brac, rare
and endemic fauna and flora from the park are also being peddled
by enterprising locals.
   Knowledgeable buyers to eco-tourism destinations in Sri Lanka
can pick up rare species of plants, fish, butterflies and beetles,
Gunewardene confirms. The poaching by locals if unchecked could
seriously endanger wildlife species, he adds.
   Tourism officials in Colombo can only see the money eco-tourism
is bringing in. "Wildlife sanctuaries, nature reserves and
waterfalls are a great tourist attraction," an official of the
Tourist Board says.
   Asked if officials were taking adequate safeguards to protect
the areas from mass tourism, he admits that not enough has been
done but the authorities are aware of the importance of maintaining
the ecological balance.
   A firm critic of the government's promotion of eco-tourism is
Dr. Ranjan Fernando, president of the Wildlife and Nature
Protection Society. He feels the authorities are unwisely
exploiting the natural resource.
   "The way the idea is being promoted in this country seems to be
merely exploiting the natural resources of the island," he
underlines.
   Fernando cites the promotion of tourism in the catchment areas
of reservoirs as evidence of official shortsightedness. The
catchment areas are protected under Sri Lanka's Fauna and Flora
Protection Act, but officials have thrown them open to tourists.
   The government is motivated by short term interests in its
promotion of tourism, he thinks. Foreigners may bring in precious
foreign exchange now, but tourism in the long term will destroy the
environmental balance, he believes.
   "Tourism will disturb the ecological balance, which will take
thousands of years to heal," he states.
   In his opinion, eco-tourism is a contradictory concept and time
and again it has been shown that tourism is geared to changing the
natural way of life.
   But officials in Colombo think otherwise. They think eco-tourism
will attract discerning visitors who are sensitive to nature and
its importance in the cycle of life.
   Eco-tourists are not looking for just the sun, sea and the sand,
a Tourist Board official here said. Sri Lanka has earned notoriety
as a destination for pedophiles. An influx of foreign tourists to
Sri Lanka's famed beaches, mostly from the west, has been seen as
the main reason for the spread of the Aids virus among the local
population.

CHINA-ENERGY:  WIND HELPS POWER BOOMING ECONOMY

By Gao Fengfeng
   BEIJING, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- China, whose coal-fired power plants
have sent pollution levels soaring, has turned to a cleaner
alternative to help fuel its flourishing economy: wind energy.
   The use of this environment-friendly and renewable energy in
China has already passed from the experimental stage to far-ranging
application, especially in the grasslands for nomadic herdsmen and
some remote areas beyond the reach of the national power grid.
   The country now has 130,000 small and medium-size wind-driven
generators with a capacity of 17,000 kilowatts. More than 30
factories produce 100-200 watt generators nationwide. Three
quarters of these small generators are installed in the Inner
Mongolia grasslands.
   Wind-driven generators enable people in remote areas to use
electric lamps, television sets, radios and other modern
facilities. Since wind power became available, more students from
backward regions are said to have gone to university to receive
higher education.
   For larger application of wind power, there are 14 wind power
stations in China. They are equipped with 99 generators with a
total capacity of 14,600 kilowatts.
   The country's wind power application is concentrated mainly in
the provinces of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Liaoning and
Fujian.
   As China has not yet mastered the modern technology of
manufacturing large wind-driven generators it has to import them,
mainly from Denmark, Germany, the United States, Belgium and
Sweden.
   Officials say wind power will play an important role in China's
effort to redistribute power across the country.
   There are about 120 million Chinese who still have no access to
electricity. Most of them live in the remote mountainous or
pastoral regions where the installation of wind-driven generators
will be less expensive than the extension of long-distance power
transmission lines from major power plants.
   The Chinese power industry is currently dominated by coal-fired
power plants, which are blamed for much of the smog that hovers
over the country's industrial regions.
   "China's coal reserve is largely distributed in the west, while
most of giant power plants are located in the more prosperous
east," says Yin Lian, a senior energy ministry official.
   About one-fifth of railway freight volume is devoted to coal
consumed by thermal power generators. This puts a heavy burden on
the already clogged national rail transport system.
   In this context, it makes both economic and ecological sense to
develop wind power in China. "As wind power demands less investment
and has far more flexibility in operation, it suits China
particularly well," says Yin.
   And China claims a rich wind power reserve of about 253 million
kilowatts which can be harnessed, according to long-range
investigations conducted by meteorological experts.
   Although the annual output of wind power still makes up only a
tiny portion of the country's total electricity output, the energy
ministry has worked out an ambitious plan that will enhance the
total capacity of wind-driven generators in China to one million
kilowatts by the end of the century.
   To meet this goal, the state has approved a provisional
regulation to give a more favorable price on wind power to the
consumers. And energy officials say the government is considering
a reduction of value-added tax, income tax, and import tariff in
the case of buying facilities from abroad.
   "The rapid development of wind power cannot succeed without
support from government, and it is particularly the case as wind
power traditionally drew far less attention than conventional power
sources," says Yin.
   China hopes to raise public awareness of the importance of this
form of energy by hosting an international conference in Beijing
in May. Local and foreign experts will discuss ways to give China's
fledgling wind power industry a further push.
   China mainly imports giant and middle-size wind-driven
generators ranging from 200 to 500 kilowatts. The conference is
expected to help China cut production cost and introduce technology
to produce its own generators.
   Denmark tops the list of donors in this field, supplying 13 sets
of 150 kilowatt wind-driven generators and one 100 kilowatt
generator for the Dabancheng wind power station in Xinjiang.
   In 1994 it provided loans worth $16 million for building four
wind power projects in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Dalian in
Liaoning, and Guangdong. Up to now, China has made use of a total
of $26 million worth of loans from the Danish government.
   "We welcome and encourage foreign funds to flow into China in
this regard, as China claims a great potential in developing wind
power," says Yin, adding that the country's target for overall use
of wind power is set for eight million kilowatts by 2020.

ANGOLA-POLITICS:  BRINKMANSHIP CONTINUES

By Chris Simpson
   LUANDA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- U.N. Special Representative Alioune
Blondin Beye says this should be Angola's year of "definitive
peace" following steady consolidation seen in 1995.
   But Beye is almost alone in his optimism. Even the Christmas
period in Angola was dominated by fresh allegations of offensives
and stiff warnings from both sides, while mediators struggled to
keep things in perspective.
   The U.N., with some 6,200 blue helmets in Angola to monitor
military demobilization under a year-old peace agreement, had been
hoping for a rapid post-Christmas breakthrough.
   Visits by government officials and Beye to the Bailundo
headquarters of the opposition Union for the Total Liberation of
Angola on Dec. 21 and Dec. 23 respectively, were meant to pave the
way for a resumption of military talks between the government and
UNITA and a summit with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and
opposition leader Jonas Savimbi early in the New Year.
   Beye took to the airwaves on Dec. 27 to give a generally upbeat
resume on the peace process to date. He warned, however, that any
ceasefire violations at this stage were unacceptable. He reserved
particular criticism for the media, warning that "hostile
propaganda" was continuing to sour the atmosphere.
   Ironically, Beye's criticisms coincided with a fresh outburst
of allegations from UNITA's radio station, Vorgan, whose "northern
correspondent," Felix Miranda, alleged that a major government
offensive in the province of Uige had killed 40 people. Quoting
local UNITA commanders, Miranda claimed heavy artillery and tanks
had been deployed by the government.
   As envoys from Russia, Portugal and the United States arrived
in Bailundo the same day for what was meant to have been a routine
meeting with UNITA, they were immediately confronted with news of
renewed fighting.
   Vorgan's accusations were later strongly backed by UNITA's
secretary-general, Paulo Lukamba Gato, in interviews with the BBC
and Voice of America. Gato stressed that the government's actions
ruled out any prompt resumption of military talks given the lack
of a "climate of confidence."
   Vorgan repeated the allegations, claiming that government troops
had massacred civilians in areas it had occupied. But UNITA's
claims were firmly denied by government spokesman Gen. Higino
Carneiro. Interviewed on local radio on Dec. 28, Carneiro accused
UNITA of indulging in cheap propaganda, adding that all UNITA's
current concerns were meant to have been addressed at the meeting
with the government in Bailundo a week earlier.
   Subsequent visits by Beye and U.S. ambassador Donald Steinberg
to the central highlands town of Bailundo on Dec. 28 and 29 were
aimed at winning UNITA over. They both met with Savimbi who had
been absent from the previous round of meetings.
   Meanwhile, a Joint Commission delegation, including military
representatives from the government and UNITA, travelled to Uige
on Dec. 29 to investigate the movement's allegations.
   The delegation has yet to publicize its findings, but U.N. and
diplomatic sources have hinted that UNITA's version of events is
greatly exaggerated and that UNITA is simply looking for another
pretext to stay away from military talks with the government and
keep its troops out of the quartering areas.
   UNITA's latest allegations have focused on the region of
Quitexe, 50 kilometers southwest of UNITA's northern stronghold of
Negage in the province of Uige. While the government holds the
provincial capital of Uige, UNITA controls most of the rest of the
province, including the frontier with Zaire.
   Uige has been tense throughout the peace process, despite U.N.
efforts to improve free movement between government and UNITA
areas. Sporadic clashes have been reported in the north, while the
civilian population has complained of harassment by the armies of
both sides.
   The United Nations is hoping to convene a new Joint Commission
meeting as soon as possible. But as of Jan. 2, UNITA's
representative in Luanda was still in Bailundo, with no word yet
from the movement on the resumption of the military talks, which
have experienced a series of interruptions over the past few
months.
   According to diplomatic sources in contact with UNITA, the
current problems should not be overstated. "UNITA is still in
problem-resolving mode," IPS was told. "But UNITA is worried about
the current crisis of confidence."
   The government however is likely to react very critically to
further delays. In an explicit warning to UNITA, a senior military
source in Luanda warned recently that the current rate of progress
was unacceptable.
   "It has gone extremely slowly. The only positive development so
far has been the deployment of U.N. forces and the construction of
the quartering areas."
   The same source accused UNITA of carrying out military actions
countrywide, of continuing recruitment campaigns and rearming. "We
have more information than anyone else and we are always asking
ourselves 'What is the reason for this behavior'?" he said.
   The government military is still denying having used mercenaries
at any stage, stressing that the South African security firm
Executive Outcomes fulfilled the kind of training role also
performed by Portuguese instructors under the terms of the Bicesse
peace accords of 1991, a peace agreement overturned when UNITA
returned to war a year later.
   Military sources have also emphasized that "absolutely nothing"
has happened in Uige, beyond a routine confrontation between two
rival patrol groups. The government maintains that its actions in
Zaire province in November and December were a legitimate response
to persistent provocation by UNITA.
   Looking forwards, senior generals remain publicly committed to
the Lusaka Protocol, the peace agreement signed in November 1994,
but accept major disagreements persist, particularly on the issue
of a new national army.
   The Bicesse accords provided for 20,000 UNITA troops in a
unified army. Some 2,500 came in and stayed in, leaving places for
only 17,500 more, many less than UNITA now wants. Government
proposals for a "social reconstruction" wing focussing on
rehabilitation and public works has met with little support from
UNITA, although it could provide employment for thousands more
soldiers.
   In his New Year's address to the nation, dos Santos called for
greater diplomatic pressure on UNITA to force compliance with the
Lusaka protocol. There has been no explicit warning yet of what
military action might be taken if UNITA does not show more
cooperation.

IRAQ-SANCTIONS:  MIXED SIGNALS CONFUSE SANCTIONS RENEWAL ISSUE

Analysis by Dilip Hiro
   LONDON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The United Nations Security Council's
routine 60-day renewal of sanctions against Iraq grows steadily
more problematic. The next reimposition, due on Jan. 8, must now
take account of mixed signals on the subject coming from the
region.
   A communique issued on Dec. 6 at the end of the six member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Muscat, Oman, backed
continuation of the embargo until Iraq complied with all Security
Council resolutions on the Gulf War. But some of the Gulf states
are in flexible mood.
   Qatari ruler Sheikh Hamad ibn Khalif al-Thani, who pointedly did
not attend the summit closing ceremony, had brought to the GCC a
message of reconciliation from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   And in October, United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Zaid ibn
al-Nahayan publicly called for a relaxation of the embargo against
Iraq. The ruler of Oman, Sultan Qaboos ibn-Said, was also reported
to be favoring mending fences with Baghdad.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Jaber ibn Ahmad al-Sabah
of Kuwait, the countries most affected by Saddam's disastrous
invasion and rapid defeat in 1990/1991, predictably remained
staunchly opposed to any relaxation of the sanctions against Iraq.
Firmly behind them was the United States. The three prevailed.
   However there are some signs of a split within the Saudi ruling
establishment. Following his meeting with Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak in Cairo on Dec. 14, Prince Khalid ibn Sultan al-Saud, the
joint coalition commander during the 1991 Gulf War, declared that
the U.N. sanctions had strengthened rather than weakened the Iraqi
regime, and needed to be eased.
   Signals coming from Amman are equally mixed. In this instance
Jordan is uniquely placed. It is the only one of Iraq's neighbors
allowed by the U.N. Security Council to have limited economic
relations with Baghdad. It is permitted to import 67,000 barrels
of oil per day from Iraq, which the latter sells at a discount
price and supplies by truck. The Iraqi government uses the income
to buy food and medicine for its citizens.
   In mid-December a Jordanian delegation visited Baghdad to
negotiate an increase in supplies of oil for 1996. Though the Saudi
monarch has by now forgiven King Hussein of Jordan for not joining
the Gulf War against Iraq and has mended fences with Amman, he has
yet to offer oil supplies to Jordan.
   But while the Jordanian king is unable to end his country's
dependence on Iraqi petroleum, he has recently taken to shoring up
the exiled opposition leaders of Iraq. In December he addressed
them at a meeting in Amman.
   He proposed a federal set-up in Iraq which, in his view, would
satisfy the three main groups in the country: Kurds, Shias and
Sunnis. Since there are no clear geographical lines that divide
Sunni Muslims from Shia Muslims, the idea has been a non-starter.
   What lies behind this move by King Hussein? Pressure by the
United States. Having repeatedly failed to see Saddam overthrown
by his own people, Washington has now seemingly opted for a fairly
long-term strategy of toppling his regime through a combination of
economic and political measures.
   Since Jordan is the only overland gateway into and from Iraq,
a country cut off from foreign air links, it has a key role to play
if the U.S. plan is to succeed. And given Jordan's economic and
diplomatic dependence on Washington, it is imperative that its
monarch must be seen to be doing something on this front.
   Nonetheless, Saddam is taking King Hussein's move seriously.
Just after Christmas Baghdad announced that Iraq's direct
international telephone links are being cut on the ground that it
does not have enough foreign exchange to pay the bills.
   Baghdad has also reduced the duration of its exit visa from 12
months to one month, thus restricting further foreign travel for
Iraqi citizens.
   And Saddam launched a new austerity campaign on Dec. 31 to halt
the decline of the Iraqi currency. He called for tax increases and
a cut in the amount of bank notes in circulation. The dinar has
plunged to 2,500 against the dollar on the black market, against
an official rate of one dinar to $3.20.
   As for the U.N. sanctions, Iraq's state-run newspapers yesterday
exuded confidence. Al-Thawra, the daily paper of the ruling Baath
party, as quoted by the state-run Iraqi News Agency, said sanctions
would be lifted in 1996 thanks to "friends and brothers" who were
aware of what it called Iraq's "real commitment" to U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
   In this decision the final report of the U.N.'s chief inspector
in Iraq, Rolf Ekeus, will carry great weight. Just before
Christmas, Ekeus revealed that, tipped off by the Iraqi government,
his inspectors had salvaged some crates from the Tigris river in
Baghdad.
   These contained gyroscopes for long range ballistic missiles,
which are banned by the Security Council Resolution 687 of April
1991. A preliminary study showed that the crates had been under
water for about three months.
   The Iraqi government's explanation was it had caught an
individual who had brought these machines into the country and when
he could not ship them out of Iraq he decided to dump the crates
into the Tigris. Ekeus is investigating the matter, and it will be
some weeks before he reaches a conclusion.
   The U.N. has offered to allow Iraq to sell a limited quantity
of oil to pay for medicine and humanitarian supplies, but Baghdad
refuses, saying U.N. conditions infringe on its sovereignty. Oil
exports used to account for 90 per cent of Iraq's foreign revenues.
   Ekeus's final report on Iraq's demolition of its weapons of mass
destruction and long range missiles is unlikely to materialize
before the Security Council review of the sanctions by Jan. 8. The
chances are they will be renewed for another 60 days.
   Thus the major losers in this 65 months old saga remain the
Iraqi population, who are suffering untold economic hardships,
widely expected to culminate in a famine in the spring.
   The average monthly wage is just 5,000 dinars, equivalent to two
dollars and inadequate to cope with prices. Currently Iraqis pay
up to 60 dinars for bread, 1,200 dinars for a kilo of flour, and
5,000 dinars for a kilo of meat. Most now survive on state rations.

ENVIRONMENT/LITHUANIA:  NUCLEAR PLANT SAFETY RECORD WORRIES MANY

By Edvinas Butkus
   VILNIUS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Even its senior management regards
Lithuania's troubled Ignalina nuclear plant as being at risk of
suffering a serious technical breakdown with potentially lethal
consequences.
   "Despite the complexity of reactor technology, in the Ignalina
atomic power plant certain tasks are carried out with very
primitive means," admits Dr. Povilas Vaisnys, director of the
Lithuanian state atomic energy security inspectorate (VATESI).
   The reactors at Ignalina, 130 kilometers northeast of the
capital Vilnius, are of the same RBMK design as those used at the
Chernobyl plant in Ukraine, site of the world's worst nuclear
accident in 1986. It produces 80 per cent of Lithuania's
electricity.
   The plant is scheduled for closure by 2010 when alternative
power sources must be in place. Yet despite extensive safety
improvements at the plant, funded in part by the European Union and
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), a
series of accidents at the plant in late 1995 raised new concerns.
   In the last incident, staff were routinely calibrating devices
to measure electron flow on Nov. 30, when engineer Vladimir Rusinov
from the plant's atomic security center was forced against
regulations to enter an irradiated area when the measuring device
failed to fit through its regular aperture.
   Rusinov was said to have suffered no serious aftereffects. "Such
a level of radiation does not cause any reaction in the human
organism and has no practical effects which can be measured by the
modern medical devices at our disposal," Vaisnys said.
   On Nov. 22, 12 tons of water from the pressurized tanks of the
emergency core cooling system were accidentally released. Although
emergency steps were taken at the time, the reactor was shut down
the next day after an automatic safety system failed.
   Eleven days prior to that leak, there was a small fire in the
machine room of Unit 1 after a pipe in the hydraulic system
cracked, also leading to a 24-hour reactor shut-down.
   In August, two cranes became entangled during refueling at Unit
2, and several days later a spent 150 kilogram fuel rod broke while
being lowered into the cooling pond and sank to the bottom. Earlier
in August staff had to leave the reactor hall while a damaged fuel
element was removed from the core. No radiation was leaked into the
atmosphere in any of the incidents.
   But this series of minor accidents has impelled Vilius
Kazanavicius, former deputy prime minister of Soviet Lithuania, to
voice his concern that minor accidents now may lead to major ones
later.
   In an article for a national daily at the beginning of December,
Kaanavicius said the plant was still dependent on Russian-speaking
and trained Russian migrant staff.
   He said that in five years since independence from the Soviet
Union, Lithuania had not trained new staff for the plant, which is
run now as it was when it opened by Russian engineers. Most of the
3,300 staff at the plant are Russian.
   "The Ignalina plant is ours, but it is run by others," said
Kazanavicius. He saw another danger if the Russian staff had to
leave the plant. He proposed that the plant be closed down as soon
as possible.
   There is also the danger that emergency procedures might not be
able to counter deliberate sabotage bids. In November 1994,
Lithuanian Kestutis Mazuika threatened to bomb the plant in the
name of a fictitious terrorist group, NUC-41 W, unless the Swedish
government paid him $8 million. He was arrested and jailed when he
turned up to collect the money.
   A range of projects to improve safety at Ignalina have been
completed or are still under way, including a 33 million ECU
program funded by the EBRD. The plant is 200 kilometers from Minsk,
500 from Warsaw, and 660 from Moscow or Stockholm.
   Ignalina itself contributed the equivalent of a further $5
million a year to the program, and aid has also been promised by
Sweden, Canada, Japan and the United States. The total being spent
on safety improvements at the site is now around $100 million.
   The managers of the plant are short of funds. They have even
tried to file a law suit against the national Lietuvos Energija
electricity company a few months ago to force the latter to pay
debts for energy already generated and sold. Last year's forced
suspension of two of the country's commercial banks has also held
up salary payments to plant staff.
   According to a U.S. Department of Energy's report on "Most
Dangerous Reactors", published this summer, Ignalina could be even
more dangerous than Chernobyl. Lithuania, however, denies this.
VATESI safety expert Alexander Aleyev told IPS last month that they
regarded the U.S. report technically inaccurate and out of date.
   Nevertheless Lithuania has set up a fund for the phased closure
and decommissioning of Ignalina by 2010 which it is estimated will
cost $600 million. Closure will not be easy and Deputy Power
Minister Saulius Kutas has said that Lithuania may consider
constructing a new nuclear plant to replace Ignalina, which has
allowed Lithuania to export power to Belarus and Russia.
   Under an agreement signed with the Russian state power company
Energiya, the Lithuanian State Power System is also exporting
electricity to Russia in return for supplies of nuclear fuel. The
total value of the contract, which ends on May 1, 1996, is
estimated at $60 million.

BURUNDI-HUMAN RIGHTS:  END TO CYCLE OF POLITICAL KILLINGS SOUGHT

By IPS Correspondents
   PARIS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- More than 1,000 people are killed by
government forces or paramilitary groups each month in Burundi, but
the world continues to turn a blind eye to such atrocities, say
NGOs working in the strife-torn country.
   Most of those killed by the Tutsi-dominated security forces are
members of the Hutu ethnic group from which the majority political
party, Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), of President
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, draws its support.
   "FRODEBU demands that the international community intervene, in
whatever form it can, including military or economic," said a
spokesman for the party in Paris.
   Ntibantunganya appealed for an end to the unrest in a New Year's
Day radio broadcast yesterday. He said Burundi faced "total
collapse" unless the violence is stemmed and blamed "fanatics" from
the Hutu majority, Tutsi minority and the Army.
   "The new year must be a year in which all these phenomena are
swept away and defeated," said Ntibantunganya, speaking on state
radio monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
   Over 100,000 people have been killed in Burundi since the
current civil conflict broke out in October 1993. More than 1,300
have been killed since the start of November 1995, but the
international community has persistently failed its victims by its
silence and inaction, Amnesty says.
   Amnesty believes that many more massacres have gone unreported
in the inaccessible provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke where
fighting between government forces and rebels has intensified
during 1995. Most victims are unarmed women, children and the aged.
   "The government has shown itself incapable of preventing its
security forces from unlawfully killing unarmed civilians and
carrying out other human rights violations," said a spokesman for
the human rights NGO before the New Year holiday.
   "The first thing to do is to send the Army back to the
barracks," said the FRODEBU spokesman, "because it is the source
of instability in the country and made to respect the results of
the 1993 elections (which produced a Hutu president). Otherwise,
we are off to an interminable cycle of massacres and carnage."
   "It is a tragedy that the international community -- including
foreign diplomats and representatives of the U.N. and the
Organization of African Unity -- has become a powerless spectator,"
added Amnesty.
   In Paris Christian Raggioli, chief of operations in Burundi for
the French NGO Medecins du Monde said that they and other
humanitarian organizations have also been the target of attacks.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross and several other
aid agencies suspended their activities in Burundi last month. The
U.N. World Food Program said food distribution to the north and
northeast had been suspended again today.
   "Whether the armed people are bandits or para-military groups
of which side, we don't know," said Raggioli. "But we are worried
about the security of our volunteers." Some 150,000 Rwandan
refugees and 80,000 Burundians in Burundi depend on food aid.
   "Our objective is come to the aid of victims, whoever is the
aggressor," he said, but if their staff were prevented from
reaching victims, it would have to consider quitting the country.
"We won't endorse the massacres," he said. "Today, the situation
is almost untenable and it is possible that we will leave."
   But the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said today that the
violence appeared to be easing slightly. There were no reports of
violence over the weekend, spokesman Ron Redmond told reporters in
Geneva.
   Amnesty has been collecting data on recent attacks. They cited
an attack by government forces surrounding Gasarara in Kanyosha
district, Rural Bujumbura province, on Nov. 14 and killed at least
430 unarmed civilians, virtually all of them Hutu.
   The soldiers also looted property and set houses on fire. There
are reports that some civilians were lured to assemble in a school,
ostensibly for their own protection, and then shot or bayonetted
to death.
   In a letter to the provincial governor dated Nov. 20, the
Kanyosha district administrator said he had counted 421 dead: 40
men, 73 women, 165 boys and 143 girls. An inquiry carried out by
security officials reportedly established that at least 430 people
were killed, while other sources claim that at least 500 people
were extrajudicially executed and many others "disappeared." The
results of the inquiry have not been made public.
   "One must put an end to the impunity of killers." said the
FRODEBU spokesman. "As soon as those responsible are identified,
they must be tried.
   "The silence of the international community?" added Raggioli.
"Maybe they are waiting for more massacres. For them to react, they
are probably waiting for the killings to surpass those in Rwanda.
In Rwanda, the killings already had to come to such proportions
before the international community stirred."
   Nearly 300 unarmed civilians, most of them Hutu, were reportedly
killed by government forces Dec. 6-7 in the suburbs of the capital
Bujumbura. At least 270 of the victims were killed in the suburban
area of Sororezo Hill by soldiers using automatic weapons, rockets
and helicopter gunships.
   The killings took place in the wake of what the Burundi
authorities said were clashes between government forces and rebels
belonging to the Hutu-dominated, National Council for the Defense
of Democracy (CNDD).
   The CNDD has denied involvement in the attacks. Some of the
attacks by government forces appear to be a continuation of
attempts by the Tutsi-dominated security forces to rid Bujumbura
of its Hutu population.
   Hutu armed groups have also killed scores of Tutsi. For example,
an armed gang attacked Campazi camp for displaced members of the
Tutsi ethnic group in Muruta district, Kirundo province and killed
about 40. Some of the killings by Tutsi militia have also been
carried out with the support or connivance of the security forces.
   Further killings were reported in Kanyosha district on Nov. 26
when soldiers attacked a group of youths playing football at
Nyamaboko primary school.
   Some soldiers reportedly accused one youth from Rumonge of being
a member of a gang which sabotaged a power station in Rumonge. They
beat and then shot the youth dead. Other youths fled in panic and
were pursued by the soldiers. Soldiers then went on the rampage in
the area and killed as many as 500 people.
   Although most of the killings are carried out by government
troops, Burundi authorities complain that the Tutsi-led army is
being demonized, a Bujumbura-based observer told Amnesty
International.
   Hutu-dominated and Tutsi armed groups appear to be almost in
competition to see who can kill the most members of rival groups,
say Amnesty. On the nights of Nov. 1 and 2 at least four people
were shot dead and about 20 wounded by an armed gang in Buyenzi,
a suburb of Bujumbura, said Amnesty researchers.
   Prominent citizens continue to be targeted by members of the
security forces and armed groups. On Dec. 2 at least five Hutu were
taken away by soldiers in Mutanga-Nord suburb of Bujumbura.
   They included Elie Ndikumana, an official of the Ministry of
Public Works and Equipment, Dr. Gaspard Nzikobanyanka, Nestor
Katihabwa, a Burundi University student, Sylvestre Niyonzima and
a nightwatchman named Donatien. Their bodies and the body of
another person were found near Bujumbura airport several days
later.
   And during a counter-insurgency operation on Dec. 6-7 government
forces also attacked the homes of several Hutu officials, including
that of Augustin Nzojibwami, the Secretary General of FRODEBU,
Fabien Sagatwa, Secretary of State for Security, and Antoinette
Bazikwankana, a former presidency official.

CONGO-LABOR:  SALARY PAYMENTS A BIG SURPRISE FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS

By Nana Rosine Ngangoue
   BRAZZAVILLE, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- If you had gone a year without pay
and then got a windfall lump sum, how would you feel? Exuberant
say Congo's long-suffering but for now happy civil servants.
   Bar owners and shop keepers are also smiling as traffic jams in
downtown Brazzaville attest to the booming following the
government's payment in December of four months back pay owed to
public workers.
   "They treated us like beggars. We'd become beggars. Now I'm
happy that we got four months salary in the space of a month,"
rejoices Augustin Elenga, a journalist at the state-owned Congolese
Information Agency.
   Paid irregularly for nearly five years and not paid at all for
more than twelve months, civil servants were on the cutting-edge
of Congo's economic and political malaise.
   After multiparty polls in 1993 swept away an oppressive single
party system, this central African state's new government, led by
technocrat president Pascal Lissouba, claimed their predecessors
had drained the state's coffers and run up a foreign debt of $5
billion.
   Economic recovery was further hampered by ethnic-based political
conflict that pitted government supporters against the opposition,
killing 2,000 and displacing 20,000 other people at its height.
Congo, with a population of just 2.5 million, seemed irretrievably
lost to chaos.
   "We endured the toughest of Calvaries. We were no longer living,
we were surviving. When I think that my landlord evicted me and
that my children lost a year of schooling as we were unable to meet
the fees, I tell myself that I passed through a terrible time in
my life," recalls Kengue Cyr, a public servant.
   For many, however, hope has returned with the big pay envelope
and a commitment to the regularization of salaries by the
government, one of the aims of a new three-year structural
adjustment program (SAP) agreed to in December by the government
and the International Monetary Fund.
   There has also been a series of talks between the government and
opposition to ease the political crisis.
   Congo's adjustment program comprises several measures to
stimulate growth in a country where gross domestic product (GDP)
registered minus 4.6 per cent in 1994, and to increase employment.
From January, salaries and pensions of civil service are to be paid
on time.
   Economic recovery has also been shored up by new contracts
between the state and oil production firms, increasing the state's
stake in the sector. Official statistics reveal that in 1996 oil
is expected to bring in $315 million.
   The effect of the public servants windfall is evident throughout
the capital, with bars and other places of entertainment chock
full.
   "There's a mad crowd here today because of the money circulating
in the capital. Before, we couldn't expect so many people," says
one barman here.
   In people's homes there is also a tangible psychological relief.
   "You can't tell how much we've relaxed now. We've paid all our
debts, that's a great relief to me," says Honorine Samba, a
teacher's wife.
   But the sudden circulation of a great deal of money has also
triggered inflation. In the city's markets, vendors are marking up
prices and the cost of clothes in particular have soared.
   "If this goes on, we won't be able to manage. Vendors don't
realize that the money we've just been paid is to pay our debts,"
says Elenga, whose joy is tainted with apprehension about the
future.
   "It's true that I'm smiling, but this happiness is limited as
we're afraid they'll stop the payments and we'll be back at square
one," the journalist confides. "I hope that this good fortune
lasts, but above all that we're paid all the outstanding salaries."
   Prime Minister Jacques Joachim Yombi Opangault recently promised
that regular salaries were back to stay. How far the promise will
hold remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Brazzaville has once again
become a sociable and happy town.

NIGERIA-MEDIA:  ABIOLA'S NEWSPAPER BACK ON THE STREETS

By Toye Olori
   LAGOS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- "You missed me because I was severely
Abachalized," explains a cartoon man in plaster on the back page
of the Concord, an independent newspaper which hit the streets
today after an 18-month ban.
   Owned by jailed Nigerian opposition politician Moshood Abiola,
who is widely believed to have won Nigeria's 1993 presidential
elections, the paper was shut down in August 1994 by Gen. Sani
Abacha.
   The Guardian and Punch, also privately-owned, were also closed
at the height of protests intended to force the military out of
power and bring about installation of Abiola, jailed on treason
charges after declaring himself president on the anniversary of the
annulled election.
   An unreserved apology to the head of state for any transgression
against either the government or the person of Abacha from the
paper's management brought the Guardian a reprieve in July 1995.
   "I hope unlike the Concord and Punch that the Guardian will show
genuine remorse and reciprocate the government's gesture of
goodwill," Abacha told the paper's management and members of the
Newspaper Proprietor's Association of Nigeria.
   But the Concord and Punch, among the largest circulation papers
before the ban, refused to give in and remained proscribed until
October 1995.
   Physical damage to its printing machines hampered the Concord's
resumption of operations, sources close to the newspaper say. But
its first issue back on the streets was as fearless and provocative
as ever.
   Today's lead story focused on democracy and the war between the
military government and the international community, while the back
page carried a six-column headline "Ogonis to Mourn Saro-Wiwa,
others" a reference to the recent execution of the minority rights
campaigner that triggered international outrage.
   The front page editorial announced: "We do not regard the
unbanning as a special favor to be reciprocated with a show of
remorse and contrition, but as a belated undoing of what should not
have been done in the first place."
   "If the Concord and other newspapers that were peremptorily
banned had breached the laws of the country, the authorities should
have prosecuted them in the law courts, unless they have no faith
in the judiciary," the editorial reads.
   The editorial thanked "all men and women of goodwill, at home
and abroad, whose appeals, according to General Sani Abacha, moved
him to lift the ban." But it notes that the appeals, however
well-intentioned, are ultimately subversive of the rule of law and
democracy.
   "They invest in persons to whom they are directed powers that
they do not posses and ought not to possess, powers that, in
effect, set them above the constitution," the editorial insists.
   The paper's tone has rekindled fears that it may be heading for
a fresh collision with Abacha's regime.
   "The Concord has to be tactical in its criticisms of this
government or it might incur the wrath of the military and its
security operatives as is happening to some opposition newspapers
now," says Biola Alagoa, a journalist.
   "If they (military government) cannot close the papers down
because of the negative impact it will have on their image, they
can at least burn their buildings and equipment down to prevent
them from publishing," Alagoa continues.
   This seems an oblique reference to the fires that gutted the
premises of the newly-opened Guardian two weeks ago and the News
Magazine on New Year's Eve.
   The finger has been pointed at security agents as both
publications were ardent critics of government. "This is the
beginning of new tactics to force opposition papers out of
circulation. It is government of thuggery," Alagoa alleged.
   Revealing that the fire at the News Magazine caused extensive
damage to vital documents, computers and other electronic
equipment, editor-in-chief Dapo Olorunyomi shares Alagoa's
suspicions.
   "Though nothing was stolen, put in the context of the Guardian
fire about two weeks ago, we suspect arson. Only our own floor was
burnt in the four-story building," Olorunyomi said.
   Tell, another combative privately-owned news magazine has also
repeatedly run afoul of the government. On Dec. 17, 55,000 copies
of the magazine were seized at the printers by security agents. Six
days later, another 50,000 copies were seized six days later
editor-in-chief Nosa Igiebor was arrested and detained.
   The Dec. 25 edition of the magazine was titled "Abiola's
Freedom: The World Waits for Abacha" while the New Year's Day
edition seized on Dec. 23 bore the title: "Abacha is Adamant;
Terrorizes the Opposition".

CONGRESSIONAL MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS ARE VALUABLE INFO SOURCES

Congressional member organizations-including caucuses and 
informal groups-can be valuable information resources for the 
savvy business researcher, yielding wealths of foreign and 
domestic industry, regional, and other intelligence.
 
Currently 165 such groups grace Capitol Hill and although the 
member Senators and Representatives themselves are generally tough 
to approach, all have at least one-often several-staff members 
who are highly approachable.
 
The level of cooperation with which you'll be greeted will vary.  
In many cases you'll encounter an open-door to virtually all the 
information on hand and available to members themselves.
 
In other cases, your caucus staff contact may simply be a 
launching pad, referring you to his stable of information 
resources on Capitol Hill, in government agencies, and in private 
sector organizations.
 
In some cases, you'll find that the group from which you're 
soliciting information will have actually published reports.  
While these were likely prepared for internal distribution, modest 
persuasion can often pry them loose.
 
On pages 4-5 of this issue of THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION REPORT 
you'll find a directory of "Congressional Member Organizations with 
International Focus."  We've divided the entries into two categories:
 
Those with direct foreign interests, such as a focus on a specific 
foreign country or region, and 
 
Those with indirect foreign interests, such as industry-oriented 
caucuses that are concerned with-for example-competition from 
abroad.
 
For each, we provide contact information including at least one 
staff member directly concerned with caucus interests.

Mexico has revamped its telecommunications regulatory authority and 
laws governing telephone and broadcasting companies.  The changes

and authority to privatize the satellite industry are but two of many 
key changes.

BELGIUM'S 1997 BUDGET

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BRUSSELS

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
------------------------
1.  THE BELGIAN PARLIAMENT APPROVED THE COALITION'S L997
BUDGET OCTOBER 4 ON A STRAIGHT PARTY VOTE.

THE BUDGET, BASED ON A CONSERVATIVE L997 GROWTH FORECAST
OF 2.1 PERCENT (NET), INCLUDES BF80 BILLION (USDOLS 2.55
BILLION) OF MEASURES AIMED AT CUTTING THE BUDGET DEFICIT
TO 2.9 PERCENT, BELOW THE 3 PERCENT MAASTRICHT CRITERION
FOR EMU.  IT ALSO INCLUDES BF 367 BILLION IN REVENUE
FROM ASSET SALES TO REDUCE THE CUMULATIVE DEBT BY FOUR
PERCENTAGE POINTS TO L27 PERCENT OF GDP BY THE END OF
1997.  PRIMARY FEDERAL SPENDING IS TO BE CUT BY F L7
BILLION, INCLUDING CUTS IN SUBSIDIES TO PUBIC
COMPANIES, IN INTERNATIONAL AID AND MILITARY SENDING.
SOME CUTS ARE MORE REAL THAN OTHERS, THEVAST MAJORITY
HOWEVER INVOLVES CUTS AGAINST BASEINE EXPENDITURE
PROJECTIONS.

2.  SOCIAL SECURTY SPENDING WILL BE CUT BY BF 23
BILLION, INCLUDNG HEALTH CARE SAVINGS, REDUCED CHILD
ALLOWANCE RTES, AND A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE
RETIREMENT AG OF WOMEN TO 65 YEARS (MATCHING THAT FOR
MEN).  EDERAL REVENUES ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE BY BF
3 BILLION, INCLUDING EXCISE AND PETROL TAX INCREASS,
AS WELL AS TAX CHANGES ON SOME SAVINGS INSTRUMNTS.
WHILE MOST COMMENTATORS THINK THE L997 BUDGT IS A
REALISTIC ONE, THEY ALSO POINT OUT THAT PIME MINISTER
DEHAENE SEEMED UNABLE TO ESCAPE FRO THE DEMANDS OF HIS
COALITION PARTNERS, MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
USE THE SPECIAL POWERS GRANTED IN THE SUMMER ALLOWING
HIM TO BY-PASS PARLIAMENT.  END INTRODUCTION AND
SUMMARY.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
-------------------------

3.  WHILE SOME OF THIS COALITION'S EARLIER BUDGETS ERRED
IN BEING BASED ON OVERLY OPTIMISTIC MACROECONOMIC
ASSUMPTIONS, THIS CANNOT BE SAID FOR THE L997 BUDGET:

-- NET GDP GROWTH L.2 PERCENT IN L996 AND 2.1 PERCENT IN
   L997;
-- INFLATION L.9 PERCENT FOR BOTH L996 AND L997;
-- SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATE FOR L997: 4.1 PERCENT;
-- PRIMARY SURPLUS (I.E., NET OF INTEREST EXPENDITURES):
   6 PERCENT OF GDP;
-- TOTAL FEDERAL DEFICIT BF 212 BILLION, I.E., 2.7
   PERCENT OF GDP, TO WHICH THE DEFICITS OF THE SOCIAL
   SECURITY SYSTEM AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE REGIONS AND
   COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE ADDED, BRINGING THE OVERALL
   TOTAL TO 2.9 PERCENT OF GDP.

BOTH THE GDP AND SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES SEEM TO BE
PRUDENT, E.G., THE OECD AS WELL AS THE EUROPEAN
COMMISSION USE 2.5 PERCENT NET GROWTH AND 5 PERCENT
SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES IN THEIR FORECASTS FOR
BELGIUM.

SPENDING GROWTH HELD BELOW INFLATION
------------------------------------

4.  OVERALL, THESE ASSUMPTIONS RESULT IN THE FOLLOWING
KEY EXPENDITURE FIGURES FOR THE 1997 BUDGET (IN BILLIONS
BF):
                  1996       1997   PCT.  PERCENTAGE OF
                                    INCR.  GDP (1997)
PROGRAM EXPEND.    788.0     811.2   1.2     8.1
SOC. SECURITY    1,492.6   1,514.3   1.4    15.1
INTEREST           668.0     676.4   1.2     6.7
REGIONAL TRANSF.   829.8     886.4   6.8     8.8
EU TRANSFERS        91.2      82.9  -9.2     8.3

TOTAL:           3,869.6   3,971.2   2.6    38.8

5.  INDIVIDUAL BUDGET FIGURES FOR THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES
(E.G. DEFENSE, DEVELOPMENT AID, FOREIGN AFFAIRS) WILL
ONLY BECOME AVAILABLE AROUND NOVEMBER - TOTAL PROGRAM
SPENDING IS BUDGETED TO DECREASE FROM 39.4 PERCENT OF
GDP IN 1996 TO 38.8 PERCENT IN 1997.
-
NEW RECEIPTS
------------

6.  THE TOTAL REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP WILL BE
MAINTAINED IN L997 AT THE SAME LEVEL AS IN L996 (A
POLITICAL TENET OF THE CHRISTIAN-DEMOCRATIC COALITION
PARTNERS).  NEW FISCAL MEASURES ARE INCLUDED IN THE L997
BUDGET, INCLUDING A BF 7.3 BILLION INCREASE IN PETROL
TAXES, BF 3.7 BILLION EXCISE TAXES ON BEER AND A BF L.2
BILLION TURNOVER TAX LEVIED ON THE BANK'S SMALL SAVINGS
ACCOUNTS HELD BY INDIVIDUALS, AND BF 5.5 BILLION THROUGH
COMBATTING FISCAL FRAUD.  A MORE STRUCTURAL MEASURE IN
THIS CATEGORY IS THE CONTINUED NON-INDEXATION OF TAX
BRACKETS FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW.
MOST OF THESE MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CONTINUING
DECLINES IN FISCAL RECEIPTS FROM A REDUCTION IN THE
TOTAL SALARY MASS AND MEASURES SUCH AS A CUT IN
EMPLOYERS' SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTION FOR LOWER WAGES.

EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT.AGAIN
-----------------------------

7.  THE BUDGET CONCLAVE PRODUCED BF L7 BILLION IN
EXPENDITURE CUTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES BEING A
REVISED SUBSIDY TO THE POSTAL SYSTEM (BF 5.3 BILLION), A
BF 5.8 BILLION CUT IN THE SUBSIDIES TO PUBLIC COMPANIES,
A BF L BILLION REDUCTION EACH IN FOREIGN AID AND DEFENSE
(FROM BF 98 BILLION TO BF 97 BILLION), AND A BF L
BILLION FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR NUCLEAR WASTE.
PUBLIC INVESTMENT WAS ALSO CUT BY BF 700 MILLION,
BRINGING IT TO ONLY L.5 PERCENT OF GDP, LESS THAN HALF
THE EUROPEAN UNION AVERAGE.  THIS MEANS THAT SUCCESSIVE
BELGIAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE REDUCED THEIR PUBLIC
INVESTMENTS BY TWO-THIRDS SINCE THE LATE SEVENTIES, AND
BY 50 PERCENT SINCE THE EARLY EIGHTIES.  NEVERTHELESS,
THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE SOME ROOM FOR EXTRA EXPENDITURES,
SUCH AS A BF 2.5 BILLION INCREASE IN THE JUSTICE
MINISTRY BUDGET (TIED TO THE REFORM OF BELGIUM'S JUSTICE
SYSTEM) AND A BF 2 BILLION (OVER 4 YEARS) INCREASE IN
AIRBUS SUBSIDIES.

SOCIAL SECURITY
---------------

8.  THE L997 CUTS MAINLY AFFECT HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES
(BF L9.6 BILLION) AND UNEMPLOYMENT (BF 2.5 BILLION).
OTHER MEASURES REFORMING DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE
SYSTEM SUCH AS FAMILY ALLOWANCES AND PENSIONS ARE FAR
MORE MODEST IN L997, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE
STRONGER IMPACT IN LATER YEARS, TOTALLING BF 34 BILLION
(IN L997 FRANCS) BY THE YEAR 2000.  YET, IT IS HERE THAT
THE COALITION SEEMS TO HAVE EXPERIENCED MOST OF ITS
DIFFICULTIES, CAUSING A DELAY BY ALMOST TWO MONTHS IN
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE L997 BUDGET.  (ALTHOUGH THE
GOVERNMENT DID MEET THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF
OCTOBER 1, THE DRAFT BUDGET FOR THE NEXT YEAR IS
TRADITIONALLY FINALIZED BY THE END OF JULY). THE DEHAENE
GOVERNMENT HAD ASKED FOR AND OBTAINED SPECIAL POWERS
ALLOWING IT TO BYPASS PARLIAMENT ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF A
STRUCTURAL REFORM OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, BUT THE
COALITION REMAINS GRIDLOCKED OVER FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES
SUCH AS REFORMING THE PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS, TAXING
FAMILY ALLOWANCES, AND MAKING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MORE
LIMITED IN TIME.

DEBT MANAGEMENT
---------------

9.  A 4 PERCENTAGE POINT GDP DECREASE IN THE CUMULATIVE
DEBT/GDP RATIO WILL BE ACHIEVED IN L997 MAINLY THROUGH A
REDUCTION OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT, PAID FOR BY THE
SALE OF EXTRA GOLD BY THE NATIONAL BANK OF BELGIUM (NBB)
(BF 222 BILLION) AND A CONTINUED SALE OF PUBLIC ASSETS
IN ENTERPRISES SUCH AS CREDIT COMMUNAL, THE MUNICIPALLY
OWNED BANK, AND ASLK-CGER, THE BANK AND INSURANCE
COMPANY (BF 70 BILLION IN ALL).  ANOTHER BF 75 BILLION
IS SUPPOSED TO COME FROM A MORE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF
PUBLIC ASSETS (E.G., INVESTING THEM IN BONDS RATHER THAN
PLACING THEM WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS).  THUS, THE
BELGIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE CUMULATIVE
DEBT FROM L37 TO L27 PERCENT OF GDP IN FIVE YEARS TIME.
BY MAINTAINING A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH LEVEL OF PRIMARY
SURPLUS, IT WILL ACHIEVE A STEADY DECREASE OF THE
DEBT/GDP RATIO, WHEREBY MORE AND MORE ROOM WILL BECOME
AVAILABLE FOR PROGRAM (I.E., NON-INTEREST) GOVERNMENT
EXPENDITURE, AND THE PUBLIC DEBT WILL BE REDUCED TO 60
PERCENT OF GDP OVER AN ACCEPTABLE PERIOD OF TIME.

COMMENTS
--------

10.  ACCORDING TO DEHAENE'S ECONOMIC CHIEF OF STAFF,
THIS IS THE BUDGET WHICH IS POLITICALLY MOST ACCEPTABLE
AT THE MOMENT.  ANYTHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL, SUCH AS A
DRASTIC REFORM OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME SPAN.  THE
SPECIAL BUDGET POWERS EXPIRE IN JULY 1997, BUT ALREADY
BY APRIL 1997 FOR SOCIAL SECURITY.  HENCE, THE
INEVITABLE REFORM OF THE CIVIL SERVICE PENSION SYSTEM
MAY HAVE BEEN POSTPONED FOR NOW, BUT 'SOMETHING' NEEDS
TO BE DONE BEFORE EASTER 1997, SINCE IT IS TREATED AS A
SOCIAL SECURITY ISSUE FIRST, AND ONLY THEN AS A BUDGET
PROBLEM.

11.  PETER PRAET, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE GENERALE DE
BANQUE, MORE OR LESS CONFIRMS THIS VIEW, WHEN HE CALLED
THE BUDGET "POLITICALLY VERY BALANCED".  HE COMMENTED
THAT IT NEEDED TO BE POLITICALLY MORE UNBALANCED TO
ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS.  PRAET POINTS OUT THAT
TWO-THIRDS OF THE CURRENT BUDGET DEFICIT CAN BE
ATTRIBUTED TO STRUCTURAL FACTOR REASONS, SUCH AS THE
FACT THAT THE BELGIAN ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY GROWING BELOW
ITS GROWTH POTENTIAL.  MOST OUTSIDE OBSERVERS AGREE THAT
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTED WISELY BY STARTING FROM
VERY CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS, THAT THERE ARE FEWER STOP
AND GO MEASURES IN THIS BUDGET THAN BEFORE, AND THAT
MANY OF THE MORE STRUCTURAL EFFORTS WILL HAVE A
BENEFICIAL LONG TERM EFFECT.

12.  THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TRIES TO PRESENT ITSELF IN
ITS BEST POSSIBLE SHAPE BEFORE THE START OF EMU.  IT
WILL STILL NEED A POLITICAL DELIBERATION TO MAKE THE EMU
GRADE CONCERNING CUMULATIVE DEBT, BUT BY SHOWING
'SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS' IN THAT FIELD TOO (FROM 137 TO
127 PERCENT OF GDP), IT WILL AT LEAST HAVE CONFORMED TO
THE LANGUAGE (IF NOT THE SPIRIT) OF THE MAASTRICHT
TREATY.

NEW ZEALAND: TWO FERRIES PURCHASE UPDATE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in WELLINGTON

It has been public knowledge for at least two years that Tranz
Rail (formerly known as New Zealand Rail) has been considering
upgrading two of its ferries servicing the Cook Strait between
New Zealand's North and South Islands.  The company has now
confirmed its intentions to replace two of its existing ferries
with two new ships by the year 2000.  Each new ferry will carry
between 750 and 1,000 people as well as cars and cargo.  The
ferries will be roll-on, roll-off in design.  Tranz Rail's ferry
upgrade is part of a pending NZ$485 million (US$330 million)
expenditure plan to take place over the next seven years.

It is an almost certainty that Tranz Rail will appoint a European
shipbuilder to this project.  Negotiations are currently taking
place with four European shipbuilders.  In a phone conversation
with the U.S. Commercial Service in Wellington, a spokesman for
the company explained that a number of U.S. shipbuilders were
approached for this project but not one was interested due to the
"roll-on, roll-off" requirement.  Further, "that any U.S.
companies specializing in maritime electronic systems would be
most likely working with those shipbuilders".

Further information on this major project should be directed to:

VIETNAM: DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR IMPORTED GOODS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   UNLESS LICENSE TO DO SO BY THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND
INVESTMENT (MPI) UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LEGISLATION (FIL),
FOREIGN COMPANIES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN TRADE
IN VIETNAM, OTHER THAN THE DIRECT MARKETING OF GOODS THEY HAVE
MANUFACTURED IN VIETNAM.  ACCORDINGLY, A FOREIGN COMPANY THAT
WANTS TO SELL AND MARKET ITS GOODS IN VIETNAM MUST DO SO
INDIRECTLY BY APPOINTING A LOCAL AGENT OR DISTRIBUTOR TO
FACILITATE BOTH IMPORTATION INTO AND MARKETING WITHIN VIETNAM.

2.   CURRENT REGULATIONS ON SALES AGENTS DO NOT ADDRESS THE CASE
WHERE GOODS ARE FROM A FOREIGN SUPPLIER.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE
STATUS OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAIN RULES AND THE
CONTRACT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.
THE MINISTRY OF TRADE HAS PROPOSED A DRAFT LAW THAT WOULD
REGULATE THOSE VIETNAMESE ENTITIES WHICH CAN ACT AS A SALES AGENT
OR DISTRIBUTOR FOR FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT WANT TO SELL THEIR
GOODS IN VIETNAM.

3.   THE MAIN RISK ARISING FROM THE GAP IN THE CURRENT
REGULATIONS IS THE RISK OF NON-PAYMENT. AS A SECURITY MEASURE TO
THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL, SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE OFTEN STRUCTURED AS
DISTRIBUTORSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THE DISTRIBUTOR BUYS THE GOODS
DIRECTLY FROM THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL.  IN THE CASE OF AN AGENCY
AGREEMENT, THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL BEARS THE RISK SINCE THE AGENT
IS ONLY SELLING THE GOODS ON THE FOREIGN COMPANY'S BEHALF.
DISTRIBUTORSHIP AGREEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED AS "FOREIGN TRADE
CONTRACTS" AND SHOULD BE LODGED WITH THE MINISTRY OF TRADE.  IN
ANY CASE, THE EXPORTER SHOULD OBTAIN LEGAL ADVICE WHEN PREPARING
OR ENTERING INTO ANY SALES AGREEMENT WITH A VIETNAMESE
AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR.

4.   IMPORTING:  IN AN EFFORT TO CONTROL ITS LIMITED FOREIGN
EXCHANGE RESERVES, VIETNAM HAS STRINGENT CONTROLS ON THE IMPORTS
OF FINISHED GOODS.  ONE FORM OF CONTROL IS THE REQUIREMENT TO USE
AN IMPORT-EXPORT COMPANY AUTHORIZED BY THE MINISTRY OF TRADE.  IN
1995, ABOUT 1,250 COMPANIES HAVE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TRADING
LICENSES TO IMPORT OR EXPORT DIRECTLY, OF WHICH ONLY NINE PERCENT
OF THE TOTAL NUMBER ARE PRIVATE FIRMS.   IN MOST CASES, THE
VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR WILL NEED TO PAY AN AUTHORIZED
TRADING COMPANY TO IMPORT THE GOODS.  THE AUTHORIZED TRADING
COMPANY WILL ADMINISTER THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING THE IMPORT
LICENSE AND CLEARING THE GOODS THROUGH CUSTOMS.   THE LICENSE IS
APPLIED FOR AFTER THE GOODS ARE SHIPPED, SOMETIMES AFTER THEY
ARRIVE IN VIETNAM.  IN EXCHANGE, THE VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR
WILL PAY A SERVICE COMMISSION, AVERAGING 2% TO 3% OF THE VALUE OF
THE SHIPMENT.   EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 1996, THE MINISTRY OF TRADE
REVOKED THE REQUIREMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR SHIPMENT TO HAVE AN
IMPORT OR EXPORT LICENSE.  HENCE, A LICENSE MAY BE VALID FOR
SEVERAL SHIPMENTS. THE FIRMS CERTIFIED TO IMPORT AND EXPORT,
HOWEVER, ARE LIMITED TO THE RANGE OF COMMODITIES SPECIFIED BY THE
MINISTRY OF TRADE FOR EACH FIRM.  THEREFORE, THE VIETNAMESE
AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR MUST CONFIRM THAT THE IMPORT-EXPORT FIRM HAS
THE PROPER PERMITS TO COVER THE TYPE OF GOODS BEING IMPORTED.

5.   DISTRIBUTION:  ONCE THE GOODS HAVE CLEARED CUSTOMS,
VIETNAMESE COMPANIES WITH IMPORT-EXPORT PRIVILEGES, PRIMARILY
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES,  MAY ALSO ACT SIMULTANEOUSLY AS
WHOLESALERS, AND IT MAY BE CONVENIENT FOR A U.S. EXPORTER TO SEEK
THESE TYPES OF FIRMS AS AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS.   ALTERNATIVELY,
WITH THE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY, THE FLEDGING PRIVATE ENTERPRISES
HAVE REVITALIZED THE DISTRIBUTION SECTOR.  PRIVATE DISTRIBUTORS
GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE IMPORT RIGHTS AND MUST SECURE THE SERVICES
OF A LICENSED IMPORTER, ALTHOUGH THIS IS SLOWLY CHANGING.  IN
GENERAL, VIETNAMESE DISTRIBUTORS, WHETHER STATE-OWNED OR PRIVATE,
LACK CAPITAL AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE A BASIC RANGE
OF SERVICES:  PROPER WAREHOUSING, INVENTORY AND QUALITY CONTROL,
RELIABLE DELIVERY, MARKETING AND AFTER-SALES SERVICE.  PRIVATE
ENTERPRISES, HOWEVER, TEND TO BE MORE DEXTEROUS AND
BUSINESS-ORIENTED THAN THEIR STATE-RUN COUNTERPARTS.  GIVEN THE
GEOGRAPHIC CONFIGURATION AND POOR INFRASTRUCTURE OF VIETNAM
COUPLED WITH THE LIMITED CAPITALIZATION OF MOST LOCAL
DISTRIBUTORS,  U.S. EXPORTERS MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO HIRE
SEVERAL AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS TO COVER DIFFERENT AREAS.

6.   MARKETING:   CONSIDERED AS PART OF TRADING SERVICES, FOREIGN
SUPPLIERS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO PROVIDE MARKETING AND SERVICES FOR
THEIR PRODUCTS IN VIETNAM.  GIVEN THAT LOCAL DISTRIBUTORS HAVE
LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN STANDARD TECHNIQUES, WITHOUT TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE U.S. EXPORTER, THESE
COMPANIES CANNOT BE RELIED UPON FOR A SUSTAINED MARKETING AND
SALES EFFORT.   MOREOVER, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR
AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS TO CARRY COMPETING BRANDS.  THEREFORE, IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN EFFECTIVE MARKET REPRESENTATION FROM A VIETNAMESE
AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR, FOREIGN SUPPLIERS SHOULD BE PREPARED TO INVEST
IN TRAINING THEIR AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR EITHER BY SENDING TECHNICAL
EXPERTS TO VIETNAM OR SENDING THE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR ABROAD FOR
TRAINING OR BOTH.  SECURING TRAVEL PASSPORTS AND TRAINING VISAS
FOR VIETNAMESE NATIONALS TO GO ABROAD MAY TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS TO
SECURE; HENCE, ADVANCE PLANNING IS REQUIRED.  CONSTANT CONTACT
WITH THE VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR IS ALSO NECESSARY.  A CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP ALLOWS THE FOREIGN SUPPLIER TO KEEP ABREAST OF THE
CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LOCAL MARKET.  CONTACT IS ALSO
NECESSARY TO KEEP THE VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR MOTIVATED TO
PUSH THE PRODUCT.

7.   REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE:  U.S. EXPORTERS MAY CHOOSE TO
ESTABLISH A PRESENCE IN VIETNAM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL
OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THEIR AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR.  ISSUED BY THE
MINISTRY OF TRADE, A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE LICENSE ALLOWS A U.S.
EXPORTER TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF ITS
PRODUCT IN VIETNAM.   THIS MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR
THOSE PRODUCTS THAT REQUIRE EXTENSIVE PROMOTION OR VALUE-ADDED
SERVICES.  THE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE OF THE U.S. EXPORTER MAY
ALSO SUPERVISE SERVICE CENTERS AND SHOWROOMS.   TYPICALLY,
FOREIGN COMPANIES HIRE AND TRAIN LOCAL STAFF TO ACT AS MARKETING
REPRESENTATIVES, WHO THEN OVERSEE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING.  A
REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE, HOWEVER, IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM
TRADING, RENDERING SERVICES, SUBLEASING ITS OFFICE, OR ANY OTHER
REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES.

8.   INTERNATIONAL TRADING COMPANIES:  GIVEN THE POTENTIAL HIGH
COST OF MAINTAINING A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE, U.S. EXPORTERS MAY
CHOOSE TO HAVE A DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF THE
INTERNATIONAL TRADING COMPANIES PRESENT IN VIETNAM.  SOME
INTERNATIONAL TRADING FIRMS REPRESENTED IN VIETNAM INCLUDE
CONNELL BROS., DIETHELM, F.E. ZUELLIG, INCHCAPE AND GANNON.
CURRENTLY, INTERNATIONAL TRADING FIRMS ARE LIMITED TO
REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE STATUS; HENCE, THE SAME RESTRICTIONS IN THE
AREAS OF TRADING AND SERVICES APPLY.  HOWEVER, THESE
INTERNATIONAL TRADING COMPANIES HAVE EXPERIENCE IN HANDLING A
WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AS WELL AS INDUSTRIAL GOODS.
MOREOVER, THEY HAVE EXTENSIVE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE DUE TO THEIR
RELATIVELY LONG TERM PRESENCE IN VIETNAM.   BY WORKING CLOSELY
WITH KEY WHOLESALERS AND DEALERS, THESE FIRMS LIASE DIRECTLY WITH
THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL TO COORDINATE MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION.

9.   FOREIGN INVESTMENT LICENSE:  IN THE LONG TERM, THE MOST
EFFECTIVE ROUTE FOR MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING GOODS IN VIETNAM
IS TO INVEST UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW.  THIS OPTION
USUALLY ENTAILS ESTABLISHING A MANUFACTURING OPERATION.  UNDER A
LICENSED FOREIGN INVESTMENT PROJECT, FOREIGN COMPANIES ARE
PERMITTED TO HANDLE THEIR OWN MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR
PRODUCTS MADE IN VIETNAM.  UNDER THIS FORM, A NUMBER OF FOREIGN
FIRMS HAVE RESORTED TO THE CHALLENGING AND COSTLY TASK OF
ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS TO
GAIN GREATER CONTROL ON THE HANDLING OF THEIR PRODUCTS.

10.  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION:  IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE MYRIAD OF
PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, U.S.
EXPORTERS ARE ADVISED TO CONDUCT EXHAUSTIVE DUE DILIGENCE ON
POTENTIAL LOCAL AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE
RELEVANT PERMITS, FACILITIES, MANPOWER, CAPITAL AND OTHER
REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO MEET THEIR ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITIES.
COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS SHOULD CLEARLY DOCUMENT THE RIGHTS AD
OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY AS WELL AS STIPULATIONS FOR DISPUTE
RESOLUTION.

JAPAN: SANITATION MEASURES FOR IMPORTED OYSTERS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in TOKYO

The following memo regarding sanitaion of imported oysters was
distributed to all qurantine stations in Japan by the Japanese
Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW).

MHW memo of September 30, 1996

To:       Managers of Quarantine Stations

From:     Director of Veterinary Sanitation Division
          Environmental Health Bureau
          Ministry of Health and Welfare

The importance of food sanitation control has been reconfirmed
since the eruption of nation wide food poisoning since May this
year.  In order to facilitate the safety of raw consumption
oysters, the following memo was distributed to Prefectural
Governments prior to the shipping season of Japanese oysters.
For imported oysters for raw consumption, your assistance in
guiding importers concerning hygienic handling is requested.  In
particular, importers should be requested that oysters imported
for cooked consumption must not be distributed for raw
consumption as indicated in this memo.

Regarding sanitation measures for raw consumption oysters

Purpose:  A number of food poisoning cases, including E. coli O-
157 contamination, has been reported since May, 1996.  Although
no raw consumption oysters have been identified as a carrier of
O-157, a guideline has been established to prevent food poisoning
from raw consumption oysters.  It is requested that Prefectural
and regional authorities of oyster production enhance their food
sanitation control.

Summary of sanitation measures:

I. Prefectural and regional authorities of raw consumption oyster
production should take the following sanitation measures.

1. Control of microorganisms in the oyster growing waters

1)  Periodical water quality testing should be conducted to
confirm the water quality standard:  below 70 MPN of total
coliform group per 100 ml of sea water.

2)  Periodical testing on vero-toxin producing E. coli. (VTEC)
with oyster meat should be conducted.  If test results read
positive on VTEC, shipment from the subject growing waters should
be prohibited.

2. Sanitation control of processing plants

In order to prevent secondary contamination, processing plants
must maintain thorough water sanitation control, health check of
employees, and clean handling of oysters.

3) Product inspection

Processors should maintain periodical product testing for the
oyster product standard (Bacteria:  50,000 counts or below per
one gram and E. Coli:  230 MPN per 100 grams) and VTEC prior to
shipment.

4) Hygienic handling

Processors should confirm the storage standard (storage
temperature of below ten degrees Celsius) and hygienic product
handling to prevent increase of microorganisms.

5) Batch control system

Processors and dealers should confirm the batch control system
with product labels, production management logs, etc. so the
original processors and growing waters can be identified with
already distributed products.

6) When VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution

If VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution, the subject lot
must be disposed, and shipment from the growing water must be
prohibited until the cause is identified and a prevention measure
is adapted.

7) Prevention of mixing with raw consumption oysters and cooked
consumption oysters

A thorough batch control system must be confirmed in order to
prevent distribution of cooked consumption oysters as raw
consumption oysters.

II. Sanitation measures for Prefectures which receive raw
consumption oysters

Prefectures which receive raw consumption oysters should adapt
the following sanitation measures.

1. Confirm sanitation control in distribution

Confirm the storage standard (storage temperature of below ten
degrees Celsius) and clean product handling to prevent increase
of microorganisms.

2. When VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution

1) If VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution, the
Prefectural authority must report the incident to the producing
Prefecture of the oyster and dispose the subject lot.

2) If VTEC is detected from imported oysters, the prefectural
authority must report to the Veterinary Sanitation Division of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare immediately.

JAPAN: 1ST ASIA-PAC INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEM SEMINAR

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in TOKYO

1.  SUMMARY.  THE FIRST ASIA-PACIFIC INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT
SYSTEM SEMINAR WAS HELD IN TOKYO ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1996.
THE SEMINAR AIMS AT PROMOTING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
AMONG ASIA-PACIFIC COUNTRIES.  PRESENTATIONS WERE MADE BY
REPRESENTATIVES FROM AUSTRALIA, CHINA, HONG KONG, INDIA,
THAILAND, INDONESIA, KOREA, NEW ZEALAND, THE PHILIPPINES,
SINGAPORE, TAIWAN, VIETNAM AND JAPAN.  EXCEPT FOR JAPAN,
ALL THE COUNTRIES FOCUSED ON HOW TO INTRODUCE INTELLIGENT
TRANSPORT SYSTEM (ITS) RATHER THAN DEVELOPING ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGIES IN TRAFFIC CONTROL.  ONE EXCEPTION IS THE
INTRODUCTION OF AN EXPERIMENTAL AUTOMATIC TOLL COLLECTION
(ATC) SYSTEM IN MALAYSIA.  SINGAPORE EXPRESSED THE LARGEST
EXPECTATIONS FOR ITS TO USE THE ROADS EFFICIENTLY (12
PERCENT OF ITS LAND IS OCCUPIED BY ROADS).  END SUMMARY.

HISTORY OF JAPANESE ITS RESEARCH

2.  JAPAN BEGAN ITS RESEARCH IN 1973 AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
COMPREHENSIVE AUTOMOBILE TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM (CACS) BY
MITI.  ROAD/AUTOMOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM (RACS) BY MOC
AND ADVANCED MOBILE TRAFFIC INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION
SYSTEMS (AMTICS) BY NPA STARTED IN THE 1980S.  THE
PROJECTS WERE INTEGRATED AS VEHICLE INFORMATION AND
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM (VICS) IN COLLABORATION WITH MPT
WHICH HAD BEEN STUDYING RADIO UTILIZATION STANDARDIZATION.

3.  AT THE END OF THE 1980S TO 1990S, FIVE AGENCIES AND
MINISTRIES BEGAN ADVANCED ITS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.  THE
MINISTRY OF CONSTRUCTION (MOC) STARTED A STUDY ON ADVANCED
ROAD TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ARTS) FOR ADVANCED ROAD
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS BY ORGANIC COMBINATION OF VEHICLES
AND ROADS.  MITI BEGAN THE STUDY ON SUPER SMART VEHICLE
SYSTEM (SSVS) AIMING AT AN INTELLIGENT CAR TRAFFIC
SYSTEM.  THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION (MOT) STARTED THE
DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED SAFETY VEHICLE (ASV) AND THE
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY (NPA) BEGAN DEVELOPING UNIVERSAL
TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (UTMS), RESPECTIVELY.  THE
PRIVATE SECTOR FORMED VEHICLE, ROAD AND TRAFFIC
INTELLIGENCE SOCIETY (VERTIS) TO PROMOTE ITS IN
COOPERATION WITH ITS AMERICA AND ERTICO.

4.  IN 1995, THE FIVE MINISTRIES AND AGENCIES COMPILED THE
"GUIDELINES FOR INTELLIGENT VEHICLE, ROAD AND TRAFFIC
DEVELOPMENT."  UNDER THE GUIDELINES, FIVE AGENCIES BEGAN
COLLABORATION IN DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGIES.
CURRENT PROGRESS AND FUTURE R&D TARGETS OF ITS IN JAPAN

FRANCE: EUROPEAN CHILDREN'S WEAR MARKET UPDATE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in PARIS

A study has been published by the company  Management Horizons
Europe  on the European children s wear market.  This study took
into consideration the following factors:  demography, market
size, spendings, distribution networks, and consumers  taste. The
survey reported the following information:

Industry analysts predict that between 1995 and 2005, the
percentage of Europe s population represented by children aged
under 14 years will be as follows:

                    1995           2000           2005

Luxemburg           18.3%          20.9%          20.8%

United Kingdom      19.3%          19.9%          19.5%

Netherlands         18.4%          19.2%          20.0%

France              17.8%          19.2%          18.5%

Belgium             18.0%          18.2%          17.9%

Switzerland         17.8%          17.9%          17.5%

Spain               16.7%          15.3%          15.1%

Germany             16.3%          15.5%          14.4%

Italy               15.1%          14.1%          13.9%

The number of children aged 0 to 14 in Europe is expected to
increase by 1.3% through 2000. However, analysts predict a slight
decrease of 2.3 percent from 2000 to 2005.

The population of children aged 0 to 14 years is anticipated to
grow from 1995 to 2005 in the following countries:

- Netherlands (15.9%)
- Luxemburg (11.2%)
- United Kingdom (4.2%)
- Belgium (1.6%)

For the same period, the same population is expected to decrease
in the following European countries:

- Spain (10%)
- Italy (6.6%)
- Germany (9.4%)

According to market specialists, children aged 2-5 years is the
only share of the population which will certainly increase
between the years 2000 and 2005.

Between 1995 and 2005, the United Kingdom will certainly see an
increase in the number of children aged 6 to 9 years (11.9%), and
10 to 14 years (7.1%).

1995 sales of children s wear by distribution channel were as
follows:

France:
- Hyper/supermarkets:    31.0%
- Mail-order houses:     11.0%
- Specialty stores:      33.0%
- Department stores:      3.0%
- Popular stores:         3.0%
- Independent stores:    13.0%
- Others:                 6.0%

Germany:
- Hyper/supermarkets:     7.0%
- Mail-order houses:     11.5%
- Specialty stores:      30.5%
- Department stores:     12.4%
- Popular stores:
- Independent stores:    29.4%
- Others:                 9.2%

United Kingdom:
- Hyper/supermarkets:     5.0%
- Mail-order houses:      8.0%
- Specialty stores:      25.0%
- Department stores:      8.0%
- Popular stores:        25.0%
- Independent stores:    18.0%
- Others:                11.0%

Italy:
- Hyper/supermarkets:     4.8%
- Mail-order houses:      0.3%
- Specialty stores:      20.9%
- Department stores:     11.6%
- Popular stores:          -
- Independent stores:    53.7%
- Others:                 8.7%

Spain:
- Hyper/supermarkets:    15.8%
- Mail order houses:      0.4%
- Specialty stores:      20.9%
- Department stores:     11.6%
- Popular stores:
- Independent stores:    53.7%
- Others:                 8.7%

Considering the above, independent stores lead in terms of
children s wear sales only in Italy(53.7%) and Spain (49.8%).  In
the other European countries, specialty stores and
hyper/supermarkets are the two main distribution networks.
Specialty stores registered good sales, particularly in the
Netherlands (70%) and Belgium (55%), while sales in
hyper/supermarkets showed  good results in France (31%), followed
by Switzerland (19.1%), and Spain (15.8%).

The study reported that the media have a tremendous impact on
children, particularly in France and The United Kingdom.  Music
and television are influential at an early age, and are thus
excellent means for  promoting products which are specifically
directed towards children.

RAPID GROWTH IN VIETNAM'S COMPUTER SERVICES SECTOR

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OVER 2,000 FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE
OFFICES AND 1,400 FOREIGN JOINT-VENTURES/ 100 PERCENT
FOREIGN-OWNED BUSINESSES HAS SPURRED A GROWING DEMAND FOR
COMPUTER SERVICES IN VIETNAM. CURRENTLY, MANY OF THESE COMPUTER
SERVICE FIRMS ARE MOVING FROM SINGLE STATION PERSONAL COMPUTERS
(PC'S) TO LOCAL NETWORKING AND/OR WIDE AREA NETWORKS. THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF PC'S IN VIETNAM HAS GROWN FROM 40,000 IN 1994 TO OVER
100,000 THIS YEAR. WITH FEW LOCAL AND FOREIGN PROVIDERS OF
COMPUTER SERVICES, DEMAND IS OUTSTRIPPING SUPPLY.

2.   IN 1994, THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT DRAFTED ITS NATIONAL PLAN
ON INFORMATICS TECHNOLOGY (IT 2000 MASTERPLAN). IT 2000 DETAILS
THE COUNTRY'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY,
DEFINES PRIORITY IT PROJECTS, SETS NATIONAL STANDARDS AND
OUTLINES POLICIES FOR MOBILIZING CAPITAL. OPEN SYSTEMS ARE NOW
THE ADOPTED STANDARD. SINCE THERE IS NO LEGACY SYSTEM OR STANDARD
IN VIETNAM, THE MARKET WANTS TO START WITH THE BEST AND MOST
RELIABLE PRODUCTS (MAINLY U.S. MADE).

3.   THE MARKET FOR COMPUTER SERVICES IS EXPECTED TO GROW RAPIDLY
WITH THE PLANNED COMPUTERIZATION OF STATE-OWNED BANKING, TELECOM,
ENERGY AND AVIATION INDUSTRIES. ASSISTING THE GOVERNMENT ARE THE
MULTILATERAL DONOR AGENCIES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND $200
MILLION IN CREDITS TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE PURCHASE OF COMPUTER
SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. AMERICAN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE
PERCEIVED TO BE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WITH SUPERIOR AFTERSALES
SERVICE.

4.   SERVICES NOW IN GREATEST DEMAND INCLUDE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION,
IT TRAINING, NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND IT CONSULTING. DATA CENTER
DESIGN, COMPUTER DISASTER RECOVERY CENTERS AND OUT-SOURCING ARE
POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, DOMESTIC SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT WILL PLAY AN INCREASING ROLE IN VIETNAM'S IT
INDUSTRY. CURRENTLY, THERE IS A NEED FOR LEGITIMATE LOCALIZATION
OF MANY INTERNATIONAL SOFTWARE PROGRAMS.

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE AVERAGE VALUE OF VENEZUELA'S OIL EXPORT BASKET
HAS BEEN INCREASING STEADILY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF
1996.  HOWEVER, FOLLOWING U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ
IN SEPTEMBER 1996 WORLD OIL PRICES SHOT UP DRAMATICALLY,
AND VENEZUELA'S OIL BASKET CLOSED AT USDOLS 22.60 PER
BARREL ON OCTOBER 15, 1996.  THIS PRICE IS THE HIGHEST
SINCE 1990 WHEN IRAQ INVADED KUWAIT.  VENEZUELA HAS BEEN
EXCEEDING ITS 2.36 MILLION B/D OPEC PRODUCTION QUOTA.
MANY ANALYSTS BELIEVE VENEZUELA'S EXPORTS ARE CURRENTLY
AVERAGING 3.00 MILION B/D.  VENEZUELA'S OIL EXPORTS ARE
EXPECTED TO INCREASE EVEN FURTHER DURING THE NEXT
SEVERAL YEARS AS MARGINAL FIELDS CONTRACTS, STRATEGIC
ASSOCIATIONS AND EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AGREEMENTS
WITH FOREIGN FIRMS ADD TO PDVSA'S OWN EXPANSION EFFORTS.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: FOREIGN TRADE - NON-OIL EXPORTS UP

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

NON-OIL EXPORTS INCREASED 32.3 PERCENT DURING
AUGUST 1996 TO USD 430 MILLION IN COMPARISON WITH THE
PREVIOUS MONTH.  THIS IS THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE INCREASE
WHICH MARKS AN END TO THE DOWNWARD TREND THAT BEGAN IN
MAY 1996.  HOWEVER, NON-OIL EXPORTS FOR THE PERIOD
JANUARY-AUGUST OF 1996 ARE STILL LOWER (14.7 PERCENT)
THAN THAT REGISTERED DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 1995.
LOWER NON-OIL EXPORTS DURING 1996 CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO
AN OVERVALUED BOLIVAR DURING FIRST QUARTER 1996.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: BRADY BOND TRANSACTIONS - CHANGE IN DOWNWARD
TREND

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

BRADY BOND TRADING INCREASED 31.3 PERCENT IN
SEPTEMBER, THE FIRST MONTHLY RISE SINCE THE LIFTING OF
EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND DEPRECIATION OF THE BOLIVAR IN
APRIL.  VENEZUELAN BRADY BOND PRICES HAVE BEEN
INCREASING BECAUSE OF THE GOV'S SUCCESSFUL
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGENDA VENEZUELA AND THE RESULTING
IMPROVEMENT IN VENEZUELA'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE.
WINDFALL OIL PROFITS, RISING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES
AND THE GOV'S ANNOUNCED INTENTION TO USE THESE RESERVES
TO REDUCE FOREIGN DEBT (PRIMARILY BRADY BONDS) HAVE ALSO
INCREASED INVESTOR'S EXPECTATIONS THAT THE BRADY BONDS
WILL BE REPAID.  THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN
COMING MONTHS CONTRIBUTING TO AN INCREASE IN BOTH THE
VOLUME AND PRICE OF BRADY BOND TRADING.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE CAPITALIZATION INDEX -
RECORD HIGH

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE CAPITALIZATION INDEX
CLOSED AT 5,481.90, INCREASING 19.1 PERCENT COMPARED TO
THE END OF THE PREVIOUS MONTH.  THE INDEX INCREASED TO
RECORD HIGHS IN ELEVEN STRAIGHT DAILY SESSIONS BEGINNING
SEPTEMBER 20.  KEY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE RECORD
HIGHS ARE LOW DOMESTIC INTEREST RATES AND POSITIVE
EXPECTATIONS OF THE GOV'S PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM WHICH
HAVE ENCOURAGED INVESTORS TO BUY STOCKS IN ANTICIPATION
OF RISING INVESTMENT IN THE CARACAS STOCK MARKET.
AVERAGE STOCK PRICES HAVE INCREASED MORE THAN THREE
TIMES SINCE SEPTEMBER 1995.  STOCK PRICES ARE EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE TO RISE, ALBEIT AT A SLOWER PACE, IN FUTURE
MONTHS AS THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO RECOVER FROM THE CURRENT
RECESSION.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: MONETARY STABILIZATION INSTRUMENTS - RATES
CONTINUE DOWN

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

DURING ITS WEEKLY AUCTIONS IN SEPTEMBER, THE CENTRAL
BANK PLACED BS. 188.8 BILLION (USD 249.7 MILLION) IN
180, 269, AND 358-DAY MONETARY STABILIZATION INSTRUMENTS
(TEMS), AT CLOSING NOMINAL INTEREST RATES OF 30.7, 31.8,
AND 33.0, RESPECTIVELY.  THE EFFECTIVE RATES ARE 29.3,
33.6, AND 35.5, RESPECTIVELY.  EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES
ON TEMS DECREASED FOLLOWING THE END OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS
IN APRIL 1996 UNTIL MID-AUGUST 1996 WHEN INTEREST RATES
BEGAN TO RISE.  EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES ON TEMS
DECREASED ONCE AGAIN FROM MID-SEPTEMBER UNTIL
MID-OCTOBER.  ACCORDING TO VENECONOMY (A PRIVATE
CONSULTING FIRM), THE CENTRAL BANK IS SEEKING A TEM
INTEREST RATE LEVEL WHICH IS LOW ENOUGH TO DISCOURAGE
HOT MONEY FROM COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND HIGH ENOUGH
TO DISCOURAGE DOMESTIC INVESTORS FROM MOVING FUNDS OUT.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: MONEY SUPPLY/M2 - EXPANDS SLOWLY

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS INCREASED 21.5 PERCENT SINCE
DECEMBER 1995.  THESE INCREASES ARE THE RESULT OF
WINDFALL OIL PROFITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETELY
STERILIZED AND THE INFLUX OF DOLLLARS INTO THE CARACAS
STOCK EXCHANGE.  IN ADDITION, MOST CONSUMERS STILL
PREFER TO HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN CHECKING ACCOUNTS AND
SAVINGS DEPOSITS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES FOR
WHICH PRICES INCREASE RAPIDLY.  INCREASES IN THE MONEY
SUPPLY PUT ADDITIONAL DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON INTEREST
RATES THAT ARE ALREADY NEGATIVE IN REAL TERMS.  PLANS TO
CHANNEL ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUES TO EXTERNAL DEBT
PAYMENTS WILL HELP THE GOV MODERATE INCREASES IN THE
MONEY SUPPLY AND THE RATE OF INFLATION.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: CURRENT INTEREST RATES - NEGATIVE RATES CONTINUE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

INTEREST RATES IN GENERAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY DURING
THE MONTH, ALTHOUGH THE MARGIN BETWEEN THE AVERAGE
LENDING RATE (34.68 PERCENT) AND THE AVERAGE CD RATE
(20.95 PERCENT) FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS DECREASED.
INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECREASING IN GENERAL TERMS
SINCE THE END OF APRIL.  EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE
FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN PUSHING INTEREST RATES DOWN,
WHICH ARE ALREADY NEGATIVE IN REAL TERMS.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - STUBBORN, BUT ON THE
DECLINE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR THE CARACAS METROPOLITAN
AREA INCREASED 3.6 PERCENT IN SEPTEMBER, WHICH IS LOWER
THAN THE INCREASE REGISTERED THE MONTH BEFORE (4.1
PERCENT).   THIS IS THE FOURTH CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY DECLINE
AND SUPPORTS THE GOV'S CLAIM THAT INFLATION IS ON A
DOWNWARD TREND TOWARDS A TARGET MONTHLY INFLATION RATE OF
1.5 TO 2 PERCENT.  THE INCREASE FROM SEPTEMBER 1995 TO
SEPTEMBER 1996 WAS 115.2 PERCENT, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST
ANNUAL INFLATION INCREASE EVER RECORDED FOR VENEZUELA.
THIS RECORD 12-MONTH ANNUAL INFLATION FIGURE IS EXPECTED
TO DECLINE DURING COMING MONTHS AS MONTHLY INFLATION
CONTINUES TO DECLINE.  INFLATIONARY EXPECTATIONS DECLINED
IN PART DUE TO POSITIVE MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS RELEASED
DURING SEPTEMBER.  AMONG THESE FAVORABLE INDICATORS ARE
WINDFALL OIL PROFITS, RECORD INTERNATIONAL RESERVES, A
RISING CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX, A SUCCESSFUL GOV BOND
ISSUE IN THE GERMAN FINANCIAL MARKET, AND THE APPRECIATION
OF THE BOLIVAR AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: INT'L RESERVES - SURPASS 1996 GOALS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

INTERNATIONAL RESERVES ROSE FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE
MONTH IN SEPTEMBER.  THIS MONTH THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY
DUE TO HIGHER OIL EARNINGS, STEMMING FROM IMPROVED PRICES
AND EXPORT VOLUME.  THE PLACEMENT OF THE GOV'S DEUTSH MARK
BOND ISSUE FOR AROUND USD 420 MILLION ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO
THIS INCREASE.  THE UNEXPECTED INCREASE IN RESERVES LED
THE GOV TO FOREGO THE SECOND USD 500 MILLION TRANCHE FROM
ITS IMF STAND-BY PROGRAM AND TO CONSIDER CANCELLING PLANS
FOR USD 450 MILLION IN IDB AND WORLD BANK LOANS TO FINANCE
FAST-DISBURSING SOCIAL SAFETY-NET PROGRAMS (USD 300
MILLION WITH THE IDB AND USD 150 MILLION WITH THE WORLD
BANK) DURING THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 7.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: SUMMARY

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS FOR SEPTEMBER PAINT A
POSITIVE PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY.  AMONG THESE FAVORABLE
INDICATORS ARE WINDFALL OIL PROFITS, RECORD INTERNATIONAL
RESERVES, A RISING CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX, A
SUCCESSFUL GOV BOND ISSUE IN THE GERMAN FINANCIAL MARKET,
AND A CONTINUING DECLINE IN THE INFLATION RATE.
VENEZUELA'S AVERAGE OIL EXPORT BASKET HAS INCREASED
STEADILY SINCE JANUARY, CLOSING AT USD 22.60 PER BARREL ON
OCTOBER 15, THE HIGHEST PRICE SINCE 1990.  AS A RESULT,
INTERNATIONAL RESERVES REACHED A NEW RECORD BY THE END OF
SEPTEMBER (USD 12,711 MILLION).  THE GOV HAS REITERATED
ITS PLANS TO USE EXCESS OIL PROFITS TO PAY DEBT, A
STRATEGY AIMED AT MANAGING THE ADDITIONAL OIL INCOME AND
AVOIDING THE MONETIZATION OF THE WINDFALL WHICH WOULD FUEL
INFLATION AND PLACE PRESSURE ON THE CURRENCY (THE
BOLIVAR).  RECORD HIGHS ON THE CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE
CAPITALIZATION INDEX WERE DUE TO LOW DOMESTIC INTEREST
RATES AND POSITIVE EXPECTATIONS OF THE GOV'S PRIVATIZATION
PROGRAM.  FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN LOCAL EQUITIES LED TO A
SLIGHT APPRECIATION OF THE BOLIVAR AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

VIETNAM ESTABLISHES 2ND NAT'L TELECOM COMPANY

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   IN JULY 1996, THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED THE SECOND
NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY BY FORMING THE SAIGON POSTAL
CORPORATION (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE SAIGON POST AND
TELECOMMUNICATIONS JOINT-STOCK CORPORATION). THE SAIGON POSTAL
CORPORATION (SPC) WILL COMPETE WITH THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT
MONOPOLY, VIETNAM POST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (VNPT).
THE COMPANY WAS ORGANIZED AS A JOINT-STOCK COMPANY WITH ELEVEN
SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING VNPT AND THE BEN THANH TOURIST SERVICE
COMPANY, EACH OWNING APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT. OTHER SHAREHOLDERS
INCLUDE THE MINISTRIES OF INTERIOR AND DEFENSE. THE COMPANY FALLS
UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY PEOPLES COMMITTEE.
SPC IS ESTABLISHED AS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE ENTITY FROM THE
EXISTING HO CHI MINH CITY POSTS & TELECOM COMPANY.

2.   SPC, WHILE INITIALLY FOCUSING ON PROVIDING POST AND TELECOM
SERVICES TO THE SOUTHERN REGION, WILL BE INVOLVED EVENTUALLY IN
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IN
ORDER TO PROVIDE WIDER TELEPHONE ACCESS TO SOUTHERN PROVINCES,
SPC WILL EXPAND WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICES AND MOBILE PHONE
NETWORKS IN THE ECONOMICALLY KEY MEKONG DELTA PROVINCES, SUCH AS
TAY NINH, DONG NAI AND VUNG TAU.

3.   THE NEW CORPORATION WILL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR UPGRADING
THE TELECOM NETWORKS WHICH CONNECT THE SOUTHERN SONG BE AND TAY
NINH PROVINCES TO QUANG NAM - DANANG PROVINCE, IN THE CENTRAL
REGION AND QUANG NINH PROVINCE IN THE NORTH.  SPC'S COMBINED
EXPANSION PLANS INCLUDE  INSTALLING 150,000 TO 200,00 FIXED
TELEPHONE LINES AND EXPANDING SATELLITE UPLINKS.

4.   ADDITIONAL SPC PLANS INCLUDE ESTABLISHING OF A FOREIGN
JOINT-VENTURE FACTORY TO PRODUCT TELEPHONY EQUIPMENT AND DEVELOP
A 100 - ACRE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIAL PARK. THIS PARK WILL BE LOCATED
IN THE THU DUC AREA, NEAR HO CHI MINH CITY AND WILL TARGET
TELECOM, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ELECTRONICS COMPANIES.

5.   A THIRD NATIONAL COMPETITOR MAY ENTER THE TELECOM SERVICES
SECTOR SOON. THE GOVERNMENT HAS APPROVED THE FORMATION OF THE
MILITARY ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY (VIETEL),
OWNED BY THE PEOPLES ARMY OF VIETNAM. GUIDELINES FOR VIETEL HAVE
YET TO BE ANNOUNCED, BUT EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE
IN FULL OPERATION BY LATE 1997. IT IS EXPECTED THAT VIETEL WILL
PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO THE EXISTING NATIONAL NETWORK,
POSSIBLY CONCENTRATING ON WIRELESS SYSTEMS ALONG THE DENSELY
POPULATED COAST.

6.    VIETEL FORMERLY KNOWN AS SIGELCO, IS ALREADY OPERATING AS A
MANUFACTURER, UNDER A LICENSE ISSUED IN NOVEMBER 1995. IT HAS
FORMED A FOREIGN  JOINT-VENTURE FACTORY TO PRODUCE TELEPHONE
EQUIPMENT AND ELECTRONICS FOR DOMESTIC SALE AND EXPORT. THE $20
MILLION PROJECT (VIETEL TECHNOLOGIES, LIMITED) WAS FUNDED BY
GOLDMAN SACHS (USA), NIKKO SECURITIES (JAPAN) AND A THAI
INVESTMENT GROUP. THE LOCAL PARTNERS CONSIST OF VIETEL AND THE
ARMY'S M1 COMMUNICATIONS FACTORY. THE JOINT-VENTURE  IS OWNED 70
PERCENT BY THE FOREIGN PARTNERS AND  30 PERCENT BY THE VIETNAMESE
ENTITIES.

VIETNAM ISSUES 1ST LICENSE FOR TRANSPORTATION & DELIVERY SERVICES TO
FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION FIRM

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   ON MARCH 12, 1996, THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT
OF VIETNAM (MPI)ISSUED THE FIRST LICENSE ALLOWING A FOREIGN
JOINT-VENTURE COMPANY TO TRANSPORT, DELIVER AND WAREHOUSE GOODS
IN VIETNAM TO TAIT (ASIA) LTD., A HONG KONG-BASED COMPANY AND ITS
LOCAL PARTNER, THIEN CANG COMPANY, LTD., A PRIVATE VIETNAMESE
FIRM. THE LICENSE PROVIDES FOR A CAPITAL INVESTMENT OF $2.5
MILLION, SPLIT 50/50 BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, AND ALLOWS THE VENTURE
TO OPERATE FOR TEN YEARS. PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THIS LICENSE,
ONLY FOREIGN COMPANIES WITH MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN VIETNAM
WERE ALLOWED TO TRANSPORT, DELIVER AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT THEY
MANUFACTURED THEMSELVES. FOREIGN FIRMS ARE STILL PROHIBITED FROM
DISTRIBUTING THEIR PRODUCTS IN-COUNTRY.

2.   THE INABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR OWN PRODUCTS IN THE
VIETNAMESE MARKET HAS FRUSTRATED FOREIGN BUSINESSES. THE
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN VIETNAM CONSISTS OF A FRAGMENTED,
DISORGANIZED NETWORK OF STATE-OWNED AND PRIVATE IMPORT-EXPORT
COMPANIES, STATE-OWNED AND PRIVATE WHOLESALERS, INDEPENDENT
AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS LIMITED TO SMALL
FAMILY-RUN AND STATE-OWNED STORES.  UNTIL MARCH 12, FOREIGN FIRMS
WERE NOT PERMITTED TO MANAGE AND CONTROL DISTRIBUTION, THAT IS,
TRANSPORTATION, DELIVERY, WAREHOUSING, INVOICING AND MARKETING.

3.   UNDER VIETNAMESE LAW, THE IMPORTER ACTS AS THE CONSIGNEE AND
HOLDS TITLE TO THE IMPORTED GOODS.  THE TRADE MINISTRY MUST ISSUE
AN IMPORT LICENSE FOR EACH SHIPMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO QUOTA
RESTRICTIONS FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES. AS A MATTER OF POLICY,
FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN PROJECTS SOLELY FOR TRADING AND
DISTRIBUTION IS NOT ENCOURAGED, AS THESE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES
ARE RESERVED FOR LOCAL COMPANIES.

4.   MANY FOREIGN DISTRIBUTORS HOPE THAT THE TAIT LICENSE IS A
STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF CREATING A LESS RESTRICTIVE TRADING
REGIME IN VIETNAM. THE LICENSE PERMITS THE JOINT-VENTURE TO LEASE
WAREHOUSE SPACE, PURCHASE AND OPERATE DELIVERY VEHICLES, DELIVER
MERCHANDISE AND PROVIDE MARKETING CONSULTANCY SERVICES.
UNFORTUNATELY,  THE LICENSE DOES NOT ALLOW THE JOINT-VENTURE TO
OWN THE GOODS BEING DELIVERED. ANY GOODS IMPORTED MUST BE
CONSIGNED TO A LEGALLY AUTHORIZED VIETNAMESE PARTY OUTSIDE OF THE
JOINT-VENTURE. IN ADDITION, THE JOINT-VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE THE
RIGHT TO COLLECT THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE.  MPI IS STILL
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO ALLOW THE JOINT-VENTURE TO INVOICE
DIRECTLY AND COLLECT REVENUES. IF THIS OCCURS, THEN THE LICENSE
WILL MORE CLOSELY REPRESENT A TRUE COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
LICENSE.

5.   WHILE INDUSTRY EXPERTS ARE CAUTIOUS IN DRAWING ANY
CONCLUSION THAT THIS IS A IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT TO THE
INDUSTRY'S IMMINENT FURTHER DEREGULATION, IT IS NONETHELESS A
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND GIVES FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION
COMPANIES HOPE FOR IMPROVED ACCESS TO THE VIETNAMESE MARKET.

GUATEMALA PASSES ELECTRICITY LAW

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in GUATEMALA CITY

1.  SUMMARY: THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS ON OCTOBER 16 PASSED
LANDMARK LEGISLATION TO RESTRUCTURE THE ELECTRICITY MARKET.
THIS KEY LAW OPENS AND DEMONOPOLIZES THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR TO
MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE TO THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT THAT IS CRITICAL
TO MEETING PRESENT AND FUTURE ELECTRICITY GENERATION NEEDS IN
THE COUNTRY.  THE LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE AUTONOMOUS
RATE-SETTING ENTITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTED, DUE TO ITS
INABILITY TO SECURE A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY IN THE CONGRESS TO
CREATE THE INDEPENDENT ENTITY.  NONETHELESS, THE LOCAL IDB
REPRESENTATIVE BELIEVES THE LEGISLATION, AS PASSED, WILL
SATISFY THE RELEVANT CONDITION IN THE IDB INVESTMENT SECTOR
LOAN NOW BEING NEGOTIATED.  HOWEVER, FAILURE TO GAIN A LARGER
MAJORITY ON THIS BILL DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR THE CREATION OF
OTHER NEW GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.  END SUMMARY

2.  FOLLOWING SEVERAL MONTHS OF DEBATE AND THE INCORPORATION OF
KEY AMENDMENTS, THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS ON OCTOBER 16 PASSED
ITS ELECTRICITY SECTOR MODERNIZATION AND DEMONOPOLIZATION LAW
BY A 49-23 MARGIN.  THE LAW IS BASED ON THE DRAFT LEGISLATION
DEVELOPED SEVERAL YEARS AGO THROUGH A USAID-FUNDED GRANT.  THE
PAN MAJORITY WAS JOINED BY SEVEN MEMBERS OF MINORITY PARTIES,
WHILE THE FRG AND FDNG PARTIES VOTED AS A BLOC IN OPPOSITION TO
THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL.

3.  THE NEW LAW WILL "DEMONOPOLIZE" THE POWER SECTOR AND
INCORPORATE MOST OF THE FEATURES OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ORIGINAL
PROPOSAL, I.E., UNBUNDLING OF PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION, AND
DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES; LIBERALIZED ENTRY TO THE POWER
INDUSTRY; AND UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM BY
PRODUCERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND WHOLESALE CONSUMERS.  THE NOTABLE
SHORTCOMING OF THE LAW IS THAT THE RATE-SETTING COMMISSION WILL
BE SUBORDINATE TO THE MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND MINES, RATHER THAN
AUTONOMOUS, AS INITIALLY PROPOSED.  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
AUTONOMOUS ENTITY REQUIRED A 2/3 MAJORITY IN THE CONGRESS,
WHICH THE PAN MAJORITY WAS NOT ABLE TO MUSTER, AFTER A NUMBER
OF ATTEMPTS.

4.  AS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED BY A USAID CONTRACTOR AND APPROVED BY
THE ENERGY COMMITTEE OF THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS WITH THE STRONG
SUPPORT OF THE ENERGY MINISTER, THE RATE-SETTING COMMISSION WAS
TO BE AN AUTONOMOUS ENTITY WITH THE AUTHORITY TO SET TARIFFS
SUFFICIENT TO PERMIT PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS TO BOTH RECOVER
COSTS AND PROVIDE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO EXPAND THE PRODUCTION
AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS.  UNDER THE APPROVED LEGISLATION THE
COMMISSION WILL FUNCTION AS INDICATED ABOVE, BUT UNDER THE
AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTER OF ENERGY AND MINES.  IT IS OUR
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GOVERNEMENT WILL ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO
OPERATE WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF THE MINISTER AND WILL SEEK
TO CHANGE THE STATUS OF THE COMMISSION AT A LATER DATE.  THE
STATE-OWNED POWER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES ARE NOW
LOSING AS MUCH AS USD 140 MILLION PER YEAR AND ONLY ABOUT 30
PERCENT OF GUATEMALAN HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY
SERVICE.  THOUGH GUATEMALA'S STATE-OWNED ELECTRICITY PRODUCING
AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES ON OCTOBER 15 INDEPENDENTLY
INTRODUCED RATE INCREASES OF AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT, A
GUATEMALAN COURT, ONCE AGAIN, HAS ISSUED A PROVISIONAL
INJUNCTION SUSPENDING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW RATES.

5.  COMMENT: PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION, WITH OR WITHOUT THE
INDEPENDENT RATE SETTING ENTITY, IS A KEY STEP IN ATTRACTING
THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAPITAL THAT IS CRITICAL TO MEETING THE
PRESENT AND FUTURE ENERGY NEEDS OF GUATEMALA.  THE FAILURE OF
THE PAN TO MARSHAL THE 54 VOTES NEEDED TO SET UP AN INDEPENDENT
REGULATORY ENTITY HAD MUCH LESS TO DO WITH COMPETING VISIONS OF
THE FUTURE OF GUATEMALA'S ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY THAN WITH THE
EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER.  THE FRG, WHICH HAS 20 VOTES IN
THE CONGRESS, HAS LONG SUPPORTED REFORM OF THE ELECTRICITY
SECTOR AND HAD GIVEN WRITTEN ASSURANCES IT WOULD SUPPORT THE
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION.  NEVERTHELESS, THE VIGOROUS DEBATE OF
THIS ISSUE -- LITERALLY REACHING THE POINT OF PHYSICAL BLOWS --
IS A REMINDER TO THE PAN MAJORITY THAT THE POWER TO OBSTRUCT IS
POWER NONETHELESS, A POINT THAT WILL NO DOUBT BE RAISED WHEN
THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO ENACT OTHER ELEMENTS OF ITS PLAN TO
MODERNIZE THE STATE.  END COMMENT.

TURKEY PUTS FORWARD A "BALANCED BUDGET" FOR 1997

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in ANKARA

1.  SUMMARY:  THE GOT LAST WEEK SUBMITTED ITS
FIRST-EVER BALANCED BUDGET TO PARLIAMENT.  PM
ERBAKAN CALLED THE 1997 BUDGET "REVOLUTIONARY,"
ALTHOUGH NEARLY ALL OTHER OBSERVERS TERMED IT
UNREALISTIC.  TO ERASE THE BUDGET DEFICIT -- WHICH
IS LIKELY TO REACH 10 PCT OF GNP THIS YEAR -- THE
GOT HAS PROJECTED A REAL REDUCTION IN INTEREST
EXPENSES IN 1997, A REAL INCREASE IN TAX REVENUES,
AND PINNED MOST OF ITS HOPES ON AN EXPLOSION IN
PRIVATIZATION RECEIPTS.  THE GOT ESTIMATES GROWTH
WILL SLOW TO 4 PCT IN 1997, AND IS PROJECTING A
MODEST DROP IN INFLATION TO 65 PCT. END SUMMARY.

-------------------------------------------------
REPUBLIC'S FIRST BALANCED BUDGET RAISES QUESTIONS
-------------------------------------------------

2.  ON OCTOBER 18 THE GOT SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT
ITS DRAFT BUDGET FOR 1997.  THE 1997 BUDGET, THE
FIRST PREPARED BY THE COALITION HEADED BY THE
ISLAMIST REFAH PARTY, IS THE FIRST BALANCED BUDGET
IN THE TURKISH REPUBLIC'S HISTORY.  PM ERBAKAN
CALLED THE BUDGET "REVOLUTIONARY," WHILE HIS
JUNIOR COALITION PARTNER, TANSU CILLER, CLAIMED
THAT THE BUDGET WAS BASED ON FACTS, NOT FICTION.
NEARLY ALL OBSERVERS OUTSIDE THE COALITION
GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAVE DISMISSED THE 1997 DRAFT
AS UNREALISTIC.  THE BUDGET DEFICIT THIS YEAR --
BLOATED BY ELECTION SPENDING AND ERBAKAN'S
POPULIST ECONOMIC MEASURES -- IS LIKELY TO REACH
10 PCT OF GNP.  EVEN UNDER CILLER'S 1994 AUSTERITY
PROGRAM, THE GOT WAS UNABLE TO BRING THE DEFICIT
BELOW 3.5 PCT OF GNP.

3.  THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ELEMENT OF THE 1997
BUDGET IS A PLANNED SURGE IN NON-TAX REVENUE,
PRIMARILY RECEIPTS FROM PRIVATIZATION.  NON-TAX
REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO SOAR BY 765 PCT IN
NOMINAL TERMS, VERSUS A PLANNED 65 PCT INFLATION
RATE.  NEARLY ALL OF THIS REFLECTS THE GOT'S
ESTIMATE OF 8.7 BILLION USD FROM SALE OF STATE
ASSETS NEXT YEAR.  THIS INCLUDES PRIVATIZATION OF
STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES AS WELL AS SALE OF STATE
LAND, HOUSING AND SOCIAL FACILITIES.  THIS
ESTIMATE IS NEARLY THREE TIMES THE TOTAL AMOUNT
THE GOT HAS RAISED FROM PRIVATIZATION OVER THE
LAST 10 YEARS; IN THE FIRST 9 MONTHS OF 1996 THESE
RECEIPTS TOTALLED ONLY 300 MILLION USD.

4.  ON THE EXPENSE SIDE, INTEREST WILL CONTINUE TO
ACCOUNT FOR THE LION'S SHARE, REPRESENTING 30
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BUDGET IN 1997.  HOWEVER,
THE NOMINAL INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSES IS ONLY
24 PCT OVER 1996, VERSUS 65 PCT EXPECTED
INFLATION.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOT IS PROJECTING
A SIGNIFICANT REAL DROP IN INTEREST PAYMENTS NEXT
YEAR.

5.  THE BUDGET ALSO RELIES ON A NOMINAL INCREASE
IN TAX REVENUES OF 99 PCT NEXT YEAR.  PM ERBAKAN
HAS ANNOUNCED THAT REFORMS IN TAX ADMINISTRATION,
TO BE UNVEILED LATER THIS YEAR, WILL HAVE AN
IMMEDIATE IMPACT BY BROADENING THE TAX BASE AND
INCREASING COMPLIANCE; NO NEW TAXES ARE EXPECTED.
OBSERVERS REMAIN HIGHLY SCEPTICAL, HOWEVER, BOTH
OF THE GOT'S ABILITY TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE
LONG-POSTPONED TAX REFORM PROGRAM, AND THE SPEED
WITH WHICH RESULTS WILL BE VISIBLE.  PREVIOUSLY
THE GOT HAS ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CHANGES IN
THE TAX ADMINISTRATIONS SYSTEM WILL TAKE 3-5 YEARS
TO HAVE AN IMPACT.

-----------
THE NUMBERS
-----------

6.  THE BUDGET DRAFT SETS REVENUES AND
EXPENDITURES FOR NEXT YEAR AT 47 BILLION USD
(BASED ON THE PROJECTED AVERAGE DOLLAR EXCHANGE
RATE FOR 1997 OF 135,000).  INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE
EXPECTED TO TAKE 30 PCT OF TOTAL EXPENDITURES,
WITH PERSONNEL PAYMENTS ABSORBING 27 PCT.  PM
ERBAKAN HAS PLEDGED TO INCREASE CIVIL SERVANT
SALARIES IN LINE WITH INFLATION; THE FINANCE
MINISTER HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED A 30 PCT INCREASE
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 1997.  HOWEVER, SOME EARLY
CALCULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE 1997 BUDGET'S
ALLOCATION FOR PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO
INCREASE SALARIES BY AS MUCH AS THE PROJECTED
INFLATION INCREASE.

7.  THE DRAFT BUDGET FORESEES A LARGE INCREASE IN
PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENTS, JUMPING 131 PCT IN
NOMINAL TERMS.  TRANSFERS TO SOCIAL SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE ESTIMATED TO
RISE BY 54 PCT, OR BELOW THE PROJECTED RATE OF
INFLATION.

8.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE COMPARES THE 1997 BUDGET
WITH THIS YEAR'S:

MACROECONOMIC TARGETS
---------------------

9.  THE GOT LAST WEEK ALSO ANNOUNCED THE FOLLOWING
MACROECONOMIC TARGETS USED IN CALCULATING THE 1997
BUDGET:  REAL GNP GROWTH WILL BE 4 PCT AND
INFLATION 65 PCT; THE AVERAGE USD EXCHANGE RATE
TARGET IS 135,000 TL; EXPORTS AND IMPORTS ARE
PROJECTED TO REACH TO 29.5 AND 50 BILLION USD
RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A TRADE DEFICIT OF 20.5
BILLION USD; THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT IS
ESTIMATED AS 5.6 BILLION USD.

----------------------
COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET
----------------------

10.  REACTION TO THE 1997 BUDGET PROPOSALS HAS
BEEN UNIFORMLY NEGATIVE.  OPPOSITION PARTIES
SEVERELY CRITICIZED THE BUDGET; AN ANAP DEPUTY
CALLED IT "SHEER NONSENSE".  CHP'S VICE CHAIRMAN
SAID THAT CLAIMING THAT THE 1997 BUDGET WILL BE
BALANCED, THE GOVERNMENT WAS FOOLING NOT ONLY THE
PEOPLE BUT ALSO ITSELF.  RAHMI KOC, ONE OF
TURKEY'S MOST PROMINENT BUSINESSMEN, TOLD
REPORTERS THAT HE FOUND THE BUDGET TOTALLY
UNREALISTIC.  MOST ACADEMICIANS AND COLUMNISTS
ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE BUDGET'S
CREDIBILITY.  MANY PAPERS ALSO NOTED THAT THE
RELEASE OF THE BUDGET COINCIDED WITH THE VISIT OF
AN IMF DELEGATION TO ANKARA, AND CITED UNSOURCED
CLAIMS THAT THE IMF TEAM FOUND THE BUDGET "OVERLY
OPTIMISTIC."

11.  SEPTELS WILL PROVIDE FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE
1997 BUDGET, INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS WHICH TOOK
PLACE LAST WEEK DURING THE MEETING OF THE JOINT
ECONOMIC COMMISSION.

HUNGARY: PERSONAL FOREX SAVINGS FALL IN NINE MONTHS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

THE REAL VALUE OF PERSONAL SAVINGS HELD IN FOREIGN
CURRENCY ACCOUNTS FELL BY HUF 18 BILLION IN THE FIRST NINE
MONTHS OF THIS YEAR.  NATIONAL BANK OF HUNGARY FIGURES
SHOW THAT THE FORINT VALUE OF PERSONAL FOREX SAVINGS
INCREASED BY HUF 32 BILLION IN THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD.
HOWEVER, DEVALUATION ALONE WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE FORINT
VALUE OF THE AMOUNT HELD IN FOREX ACCOUNTS AT THE START OF
THE YEAR BY HUF 50 BILLION.  FOREX SAVINGS INCREASED BY
HUF 1.5 BILLION IN FORINT TERMS IN SEPTEMBER BUT THE 1.2
PERCENT RATE OF THE CRAWLING PEG DEVALUATION ALONE WOULD
HAVE CAUSED A HUF 5.5 BILLION INCREASE LAST MONTH.
PERSONAL SAVINGS HELD IN FOREX ACCOUNTS TOTALLED HUF 471
BILLION AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER.  MORE THAN 30 BANKS OFFER
PERSONAL FOREX ACCOUNTS BUT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL FOREX
SAVINGS ARE HELD AT OTP.  HALF OF ALL FOREX SAVINGS ARE IN
DEUTCH MARKS, 20 PERCENT IN U.S.DOLLARS AND 12 PERCENT IN
AUSTRIAN SHILLINGS.  FINANCIAL ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT FOREX
SAVINGS HAVE LOST THEIR APPEAL BECAUSE OF HIGHER YIELDS ON
FORINT SAVINGS AND THE PREDICTABLE RATE OF DEVALUATION BY
THE CRAWLING PEG MECHANISM.

HUNGARY: DEVALUATION EXHAUSTS ITS EXPORT-PROMOTING EFFECT

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

ACCORDING TO THE LATEST ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIC
RESEARCH INSTITUTE (GKI), THE FORINT DEVALUATION LOST ITS
EXPORT-STIMULATING EFFECT AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR.
FOREIGN TRADE FIGURES SHOW ADVERSE TRENDS FROM THE SECOND
THIRD OF 1996, COMPARED TO EARLIER EXPECTATIONS.  EXPORTS
GREW BY 5.2 PERCENT, CALCULATED IN DOLLARS AND BY 8.9
PERCENT IN VOLUME DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS, COMPARED TO
THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THESE FIGURES ARE DOWN FROM
THE FIRST QUARTER.

THE FORMERLY STRONG ACTIVITY IN EXPORTS MOTIVATED BY
EXTERNAL PRICES IN FORINT TERMS WEAKENED IN 1996.  THIS
WAS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT COMPANIES COULD
REALIZE A HIGHER INCREASE IN DOMESTIC SALES PRICES THAN IN
EXPORT PRICES DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF THE
CRAWLING-PEG DEVALUATION.  THE RISING IMPORT PRICES DUE TO
THE IMPORT DUTY SURCHARGE ALSO ASSISTED DOMESTIC
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES TO RAISE DOMESTIC PRICES ABOVE
EXPORT PRICES.  BY THE MIDDLE OF 1996, IN MOST INDUSTRIAL
SECTORS, THE PRICE ADVANTAGE OF EXPORTING CEASED TO EXIST.

GKI FORECASTS THAT THE VOLUME OF EXPORTS WILL GROW BY
6-7 PERCENT, WHILE IMPORTS WILL BE UP 3-4 PERCENT IN 1996.
THE MONTHLY ONE PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE DUTY SURCHARGE,
WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BE ABOLISHED BY JULY 1997, COULD
CAUSE A 10 PERCENT DECREASE IN THE COST OF IMPORTED GOODS,
THUS BOOSTING IMPORTS STRONGLY.  GKI EXPERTS DO NOT THINK
THAT THE IMPORT INCREASE COULD BE OFFSET BY A RISE IN THE
COMPETITIVENESS OF EXPORTS NEXT YEAR.

HUNGARY: GOVERNMENT PUBLISHES THREE-YEAR FORECAST

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

UNDER THE LAW ON PUBLIC FINANCES, THE GOVERNMENT IS
COMMITTED TO PRESENT A THREE-YEAR OUTLOOK OF MAJOR
ECONOMIC INDICATORS ACCOMPANYING THE ANNUAL BUDGET BILL.
ACCORDING TO THIS THREE-YEAR FORECAST, THE GOVERNMENT
EXPECTS A HUF 40 BILLION COMBINED DEFICIT IN THE TWO
SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS IN 1998 AND A HUF 28 BILLION DEFICIT
IN 1999 FOLLOWING A BALANCED BUDGET IN BOTH FUNDS IN 1997.
THE GFS GENERAL GOVERNMENT DEFICIT INCLUDING PRIVATIZATION
REVENUES IS FORECAST AT HUF 315.2 BILLION NEXT YEAR, 376.3
BILLION IN 1998 AND HUF 330.9 BILLION IN 1999.  THE GFS
DEFICIT IN PUBLIC FINANCES EXCLUDING INCOME FROM
PRIVATIZATION IS FORECAST AT 4.9 PERCENT OF GDP IN 1997,
4.3 PERCENT IN 1998, AND 3.3 PERCENT IN 1999.  THE
FORECAST PROJECTS 2 PERCENT GDP GROWTH NEXT YEAR, 3-4
PERCENT GROWTH IN 1998 AND 4-5 PERCENT GROWTH IN 1999.
THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS INFLATION OF 17-19 PERCENT NEXT
YEAR, 12-14 PERCENT IN 1998 AND 10 PERCENT IN 1999 WHILE
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCER PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE 1-3
PERCENT POINTS SLOWER THAN CONSUMER PRICES.  THE FORECAST
PROJECTS AN 8-10 PERCENT INCREASE IN EXPORTS NEXT YEAR
FOLLOWED BY A 5-7 PERCENT INCREASE IN 1998 AND A 7-9
PERCENT INCREASE IN 1999.

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

THE OUTPUT OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN AUGUST WAS
UNCHANGED FROM JULY AND WAS THREE PERCENT DOWN, IN VOLUME
TERMS, ON AUGUST 1995.  THE VOLUME OF NEW CONSTRUCTION

A TOTAL BUDGET OF HUF 17 BILLION (CURRENT HUF/DOLLAR
EXCHANGE IS APPROXIMATELY 155 HUF/1 USD) IN AUGUST AND 141
PROJECTS WORTH HUF 7 BILLION WERE FINISHED.  THE VALUE OF
PROJECTS STARTED WAS 35 PERCENT HIGHER THAN IN AUGUST 1995
WHILE THE VALUE OF COMPLETED PROJECTS WAS 25 PERCENT

HUNGARY: PRIVATE RESEARCH INSTITUTE FORECASTS 2.5% GDP GROWTH IN 1997

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

(GKI) THE PRIVATE ECONOMIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE
FORECASTS A 2.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN GDP, A 5-6 PERCENT
RISE IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND A 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN
INVESTMENTS FOR 1997.  GKI PROJECTS ANNUAL AVERAGE
CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION OF 20 PERCENT FOR NEXT YEAR, AN
AVERAGE OF TWO DIFFERENT ESTIMATIONS.  ASSUMING AN ANNUAL
25 PERCENT INCREASE IN ENERGY PRICES, THE INFLATION RATE
COULD BE 19 PERCENT OR ASSUMING AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 40
PERCENT INCREASE IN ENERGY PRICES, THE INFLATION RATE
COULD BE 21 PERCENT.  SIGNIFICANT FACTORS, SUCH AS THE
ABOLITION OF THE 6 PERCENT IMPORT SURCHARGE IN THE FIRST
HALF OF 1997 AND TARIFF REDUCTIONS WILL REDUCE IMPORT
COSTS NEXT YEAR.  THE REDUCTION IN IMPORT COSTS COULD
RESULT IN AN IMPORT GROWTH RATE EXCEEDING THAT OF EXPORTS.
GKI FORECASTS AN EIGHT PERCENT IMPORT INCREASE AND A 6
PERCENT EXPORT INCREASE FOR 1997, RESULTING IN A USD 200-
300M RISE IN TRADE DEFICIT OVER THE YEAR.  GKI FORECASTS A
USD 2.5 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT OF USD 1.8-2 BILLION, WHICH
IS STILL SLIGHTLY BELOW THE VALUE OF EXPECTED DIRECT
FOREIGN CASH INVESTMENTS.

THE 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN INVESTMENT SHOULD BE
FUELLED BY IMPROVING THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR PRODUCERS
SUPPLYING THE DOMESTIC MARKET.  LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE
CENTRAL BUDGET ARE ALSO PLANNING TO INCREASE INVESTMENT
SPENDING.  ESTIMATIONS BASED ON TAX AMENDMENT PROPOSALS
FOR NEXT YEAR SHOW A 20 PERCENT INCREASE IN BOTH GROSS AND
NET WAGES, RESULTING IN NO FURTHER FALL IN REAL WAGES.
PERSONAL CONSUMPTION, HOWEVER, IS EXPECTED TO RISE BY 1
PERCENT, DUE TO DELAYED PURCHASES FROM PRECEDING YEARS.
HENCE THE GROWTH RATE OF PERSONAL SAVINGS IS EXPECTED TO
FALL SLIGHTLY.  DOMESTIC DEMAND IN VOLUME TERMS, IS
PROJECTED TO RISE TO 3 PERCENT AS A RESULT OF INVESTMENTS
AND CONSUMPTION.  GKI FORECASTS A CONSOLIDATED GENERAL
GOVERNMENT DEFICIT IN THE RANGE OF 4.5-5 PERCENT OF NEXT
YEAR'S GDP, SIMILAR TO THAT OF 1996.  (NOTE: REFTEL
EXPLAINS THE NEW ACCOUNTING MEASURE TO BE USED BY THE GOH
BEGINNING IN 1997.  WITHOUT THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING
METHODS, THE 1997 CONSOLIDATED BUDGET WOULD BE THREE
PERCENT OF GDP.  END NOTE.)  PROVIDED FINANCING
REQUIREMENTS OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT EXCEED
THIS LIMIT, NOMINAL INTEREST COULD FALL FROM 22 PERCENT AT
THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR TO 19 PERCENT AT THE END.  GKI
WARNS THAT POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS EXPECTED FOR NEXT YEAR
ARE CONSIDERABLY THREATENED.  A POSSIBLE RISE IN DOMESTIC
DEMAND COULD GENERATE A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED IMPORT
INCREASE RATHER THAN BOOSTING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION.  IN
ADDITION, THE PLANNED RESTRUCTURING OF TAXES AND SOCIAL
SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS MAY NOT PRODUCE THE TARGETED
REVENUES.  FINALLY, GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1998 COULD LEAD
TO A SOFTENED ECONOMIC POLICY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1997.

HUNGARY: GOV'T FORECASTS 1 PERCENT GDP GROWTH IN 1996

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

ACCORDING TO THE FINANCE MINISTRY, HUNGARY'S GDP IS
EXPECTED TO GROW BY ONLY ONE PERCENT THIS YEAR AS A RESULT
OF DECLINING DOMESTIC DEMAND.  THE MINISTRY FORECASTS AN
8-10 PERCENT ANNUAL GROWTH IN EXPORTS AND A 3-5 PERCENT
INCREASE IN IMPORTS RESULTING IN A USD 1.8 BILLION TRADE
DEFICIT, USD 800 MILLION LESS THAN LAST YEAR.  THE DEFICIT
IN THE CURRENT ACCOUNT IS NOW PROJECTED AT USD 1.7
BILLION, USD 300 MILLION LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL TARGET.
THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE ANNUAL
GDP WILL BE LESS THAN 4 PERCENT THIS YEAR AS COMPARED TO
5.5 PERCENT LAST YEAR AND OVER 9 PERCENT IN 1994.  NET
DEBT IN PROPORTION TO EXPORT REVENUE IS PROJECTED TO BE
BELOW 110 PERCENT THIS YEAR, DOWN FROM 130 PERCENT IN 1995
AND 180 PERCENT IN 1994.

THE FINANCE MINISTRY PROJECTS ANNUAL AVERAGE CONSUMER
PRICE INFLATION OF 23-24 PERCENT AND 20 PERCENT TWELVE-
MONTH INFLATION IN DECEMBER, WHICH ARE BOTH HIGHER THAN
THE ORIGINAL GOVERNMENT TARGETS OF 20 PERCENT AND 16
PERCENT RESPECTIVELY.

VIETNAM PLANS TO DEVELOP DEEP-SEA FISHING FLEET: OPP'TIES

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.  VIETNAM'S INTEREST IN DEVELOPING A DEEP SEA FLEET CAPABILITY
BETWEEN NOW AND THE YEAR 200 IS TRONG.  INDEED, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS MADE DEEP SEA FISHING AND AQUACULTURE AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
PRIORITY.  CURRENT ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT THE VIETNAMESE FISHING
INDUSTRY WILL NEED TO INVEST $600 MILLION USD OVER TH NEXT FIVE
YEARS IN ORDER TO RAISE OVERALL PRODUCTION FOR CONSUMPTION
INTERNALLY AND FOR EXPORT (OF HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS) FROM 800,000
TONS PER YEAR TO 1,200,000/1,500,000-THE TARGET OBJECTIVE.

2.  VIETNAM PRESENTLY HAS NO DEEP SEA FLEET CAPABILITY.  ITS
FLEET IS LIMITED TO SMALL COASTAL VESSELS OF 400-600 HP WORKING
AT A DEPTH OF 30 TO 50 METERS.  HOWEVER, TO INCREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY ANNUAL PRODCUTION OF SHRIMP AND YELLOW FIN TUNA,
VIETNMA MUST DEVELOP THE CAPABILITY TO FISH FOR LARGER SIZE
SHRIMP FOUND AT A DEPTH OF 120 TO 150 METERS AND A RANGE OF
150-200 KM FROM SHORE.  THE PRODUCTION BY VIETNAM OF FRESH SHRIMP
AND TUNA ARE BELIEVED TO BE MOST LUCRATIVE FOR SERVICING WORLD
MARKETS.  CURRENTLY, FOREIGN COMPANIES PRIMARILY FROM TAIWAN AND
JAPAN ARE CONTROLLING THIS CATCH.

3.  ACCORDING TO CURRENT ESTIMATES, VIETNAMESE INDUSTRY MUST
DEVELOP A FLEET OF 50 TUNA VESSELS, WITH A "MOTHER" PRCOESSING
SHIP TO PRESERVE THE CATCH AND ENSURE THE HIGHEST QUALITY. FOR
SHRIMPING, THE FLEET IS FOR 250 VESSELS.  A DETAILED GOVERNMENT
SURVEY OF VESSEL NEEDS BY PROVINCE, NOW UNDERWAY, SHOULD BE
COMPLETED BY THE 4TH QUARTER OF 1996.  THE BOATS REQUIRED ARE
EXPECTED TO RANGE IN SIZE FROM 75 TO 110 FEET, WITH 600 HP TO
1,000 HP ENGINES.  EQUIPMENT FOR SHRIPING WILL INCLUDE CAGES FOR
MATURE CRAWFISH, PLUS CONVENTIONAL NETTING GEAR.

4.  THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF VIETNAM FOR A PHASED
APPROACH ROUGHLY AS FOLLOWS:  1) THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
APPROVED A $57 MILLION SOFT LOAN PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH THE
LAND-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT DEEP SEA FISHING AND
PURCAHSE ONE 30-50 FEET ALUMINUM HULL FISHING VESSELS, WITH 250
HP (IMPORTED) ENGINES; 2) PURCAHSE OUTRIGHTA NUMBER OF LARGER
SIZE VESSELS FROM ABROAD; 3) ENTER JOINT VENTURES IMPLEMENTED
WITH FOREIGN FIRMS TO CONSTRUCT FISHING VESSELS, USING VIETNAMSE
STAFF IN FOREIGN SHIP YARDS, FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY OF VESSELS IN
VIETNAM AND THEN ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT, NATIONAL
SHIPBUILDING CAPABILITY.

5.  COMPETITIVE FINANCING WILL BE KEY IN ORDER TO WIN ORDERS TO
SUPPLY THESE FISHING VESSELS TOVIETNAM, AUTHORITIES EMPHASIZE.
AND, VIETNAM'S EXPORTERS WILL NEED TO HAVE ASSURED COMMERCIAL
ACCESS TO FOREIGN MARKETS FOR ITS TUNA AND SHRIMP TO BE ABLE TO
SERVICE PAYMENT OF LOAN OBLIGATIONS INCURRED.

6.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:  DR. HO VAN HOANH,
DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION DEPARTMENT, MINISTRY OF
FISHERIES, 57 NGOC KHANH, BA DINH, HANOI, TEL: 84-4-8326396; FAX:
84-4-8326702.

FROM THE DESK OF GEOFFREY BELL

"The main excitement at the London summit naturally centered on
President Gorbachev's visit and his economic plans.  Beneath the cordial
public reception, a vigorous debate raged behind the scenes over how far
the West should go in offering financial assistance, with the US and
Japan taking the hardline position.  The end result will be some increase
in technical assistance and a modest relaxation of restrictions on EBRD
lending to the USSR.

"At the same time, and with considerable fanfare, the USSR has been
granted `special association' with the IMF and World Bank.  The original
idea, floated at the G7 finance ministers' meeting in London, was to
make the Soviet Union an `associate member' of the Bretton Woods
institutions -- but since the multilaterals' statutes currently have no such
membership classification, `special association' has been substituted for
`associate member' status.  The end result is the same: Moscow will
supply the multilaterals with economic statistics, the IMF can examine
USSR economic performance in Article IV-type consultations, and the
USSR is eligible for technical assistance in reforming its economy.

"But the new Soviet linkage with the multilaterals does not entail new
financial commitments from Washington.  Moscow will have no quota
at the IMF, nor is the World Bank expected to finance major projects in
the Soviet Union.  Put another way, there is less to `associate status' than
meets the eye, and surely no substitute for the broader benefits of full
membership -- which is still some distance off.

"The dollar behaved impeccably for the G7 summit, with the massive
coordinated central bank intervention on July 12 successful in keeping
the currency slightly below the DM1.80  level throughout the meetings.
While the dollar is still vulnerable to a near-term correction, however,
our surveys indicate a heavy majority of market participants feel that the
general trend for the dollar remains upward.  That conviction has been
reinforced by Fed Chairman Greenspan's decidedly upbeat economic
review in congressional testimony this week, where he predicted growth
ranging from 2 1/4-3% in 1992 and steady progress in bringing down
inflation.

"While few economists now challenge the administration's contention
that the recession has ended, serious questions linger over the strength
of the economy.  Greenspan may well be correct about growth next year,
but the current air of caution in the consumer and business sectors
suggests his optimistic forecast could prove a bit on the high side.  The
chairman's view did gain support this week from report of a June
housing starts rise of 5.2%, surpassing the 1 million annualized rate for
the first time since November 1990.  In response, bond yields have
backed up slightly, with the long bond yielding just under 8.5%.

"We have been emphasizing the inevitability of US bank consolidation
for some time, so the only surprise in the Chemical/Manufacturers
Hanover marriage announced on July 15 is that it happened sooner than
many analysts expected.  This first money center merger, along with the
proposed NCNB-C&S/Sovran coupling, is likely to trigger a series of
similar consolidations.  Bankers have shown a consistent pattern of
rushing in the same direction -- whether the fad be LDC loans, highly
leveraged transactions or globalization and securitization -- and the
merger movement is likely to be no different.  Bank stocks have
immediately moved up, and investment houses are eager for the action
given the paucity of new business elsewhere.

"One area of banking where activity is growing fast is the funding of
Third World debt.  Prices have been rising very sharply, and bankers
anxious to sell their loans are finding willing new buyers in trading
rooms and among portfolio managers looking for high-yield paper.  It is
no exaggeration to argue that the Latin American debt crisis is nearing
an end: Indeed, the value of bank loans in the secondary market already
equals or exceeds the written-down value in the books of many banks."

Coming Down from the Summit

THE LONDON SUMMIT was historic by virtue of Soviet President
Gorbachev's presence and the synchronized announcement of the
conclusion of the START negotiations.  But the focus on Gorbachev
pushed a diverse range of other important economic and diplomatic
issues to the background, and that raises serious questions about summit
reform.

The bare bones of the deal with Gorbachev were widely anticipated:
"special association" with the IMF and the World Bank and commitments
to provide technical advice in specific sectors, notably energy and food
distribution.  The promises of additional assistance from the OECD and
the EBRD do not amount to much.  More significant was the proposed
help with retooling military factories for civilian use, which doubtless did
not go unnoticed by the hardliners in Moscow.  In the end, Gorbachev
emerged with only modest Western commitments to expand financial
assistance, sweetened with lavish praise and an invitation to the 1992
summit.  The latter has been widely interpreted as a first step toward a
G8 -- but in fact, it is little more than a symbolic gesture aimed at
shoring up the Soviet president's political position at home.

Aside from the Soviet question, G7 leaders offered a semblance of
movement on several issues, including a reaffirmed commitment to
control arms sales and arrest the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.  Participants also gave an endorsement to renewed efforts to
achieve a negotiated peace settlement in the Middle East, and established
a yearend deadline for conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT
negotiations.  It remains doubtful, however, whether G7 goals on arms
control and Mideast policy can be realized -- and the consensus on the
general need for a GATT accord does nothing to resolve the sticky issues
that frustrated attempts to meet the original deadline for conclusion of the
Uruguay Round at end-1990.

Perhaps more notable is what the summit participants scarcely discussed
at all.  Environmental issues got a scant 15 minutes of public discussion,
and the tour d'horizon in the final communique reappeared virtually
verbatim the Houston summit positions on secondary issues ranging from
drug trafficking to aid to Africa.  In effect, the agenda was hijacked by
the Soviet question -- and the gradual erosion in substance, continuity
and focus at annual G7 summits over the past decade has continued.

What should be done?  A Group of Thirty report released last week put
forward three practical recommendations:

* Set a new core agenda for future summits alongside a topical agenda
of items like aid for the Soviet Union.  The core should comprise five
broad topics -- aid, trade and investment, economics (macro and
structural adjustment), defense and the environment.

* Define, manage and monitor sharing of responsibility on core agenda
issues in a systematic and comprehensive manner.  That would require
G7 leaders to agree on performance measures for their own countries,
which would then be used to frame the discussion of burden-sharing and
tradeoffs in different areas of the G30 process.

* Improve arrangements for follow-through on summit decisions.  One
possibility would be to emulate the European Council of Ministers, with
heads of state meeting twice a year and periodic ministerial consultations
beyond finance to other areas such as agriculture and trade.  Broader
ministerial representation at the leadership summits could also assure
more comprehensive discussion of policy coordination in specific areas.

On balance, the London summit avoided the appearance of failure, but
it failed to deal effectively with the pressing international issues that
threaten to destabilize the world order.  If progress on GATT is achieved
and if the Soviet Union can somehow be extricated from its present
political and economic morass, the summit may have served sufficient
purpose.  But the prospect of new frustrations looms large on both fronts
-- and something more than pageantry may be required when G7 leaders
meet again.

Chemical/Manny Hanny: Let the Mergers Begin

THE MONEY CENTER MERGER long rumored finally took its first
step toward consummation this week -- and more such consolidation
moves in the US banking industry are imminent.  Once the merger of
Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover is carried out -- there seems scant
chance regulators will object, though it represents a major setback for
New York City employment and municipal revenues -- the new Chemical
Banking Corp. will have assets of US$135.5 billion, second only to
Citicorp with US$216.9 billion.  That puts more pressure on fourth-place
Chase Manhattan, fast sliding down the US asset league table with
US$98.1 billion, to shop around.  Others will have to consider mergers
just to remain cost-competitive, particularly those with large branch
networks in crowded banking markets.

Some analysts see Chase linking up with the Bank of New York, a
US$39.44 billion institution, though BNY is still working through the
aftereffects of its 1988 merger/takeover of Irving Trust.  There are
multiple consolidation possibilities on the West Coast, even if
deterioration of California and other Pacific real estate markets and bank
credit quality may delay action until the worst loans are shaken out.
Executives from Wells Fargo and Security Pacific held exploratory talks
last year; they may be taking a second look.  Another widely touted
match would merge First Interstate of Los Angeles into the well-
capitalized and aggressively expanding BankAmerica of San Francisco.
In the South, NCNB and C&S/Sovran were already talking merger as a
combined US$116.6 billion regional power when this week's news
broke, and high-performance Wachovia and South Carolina National
Bank recently tied a definitive knot.  In the Midwest, some see the
possibility of a merger between First Chicago and Continental Bank --
the latter just shaking off the lingering effects of its 1984 liquidity crisis
and rescue by the FDIC.

The Chemical/Manny Hanny merger is encouraging because it indicates
that, in the upper reaches of the US industry, realism is prevailing over
issues of institutional prestige and executive ego.  Put another way, post-
consolidation yearly cost savings of US$650 million were simply too
great to be overlooked at a time of diminished earnings prospects.  IR
has long argued that the US industry is weakened by its fragmentation
into an excessive number of institutions, with much of the excess
capacity to be found in the New York money center.  Together,
Chemical and Manufacturers have 562 branches in New York and the
surrounding region -- 133 in Manhattan alone.  Seventy branches will be
eliminated, contributing in significant part to the overall savings as at
least 6,200 jobs from a combined total of 45,000 are eliminated.  That's
a tough blow to New York, whose job pool and revenues had already
taken a major hit as the financial industry dramatically contracted.  But
as bankers prepare to cope with pending legislation in Congress that
would lock undercapitalized institutions out of expanded business areas,
they are likely to give local political considerations considerably less
weight.

Another important implication of the Chemical/Manny Hanny deal is the
new lease on life it has given bank stocks, whose first-half rebound was
in danger of petering out.  Shares of both banking concerns posted large
gains on the news, pulling up other banking issues.  Investors see a wave
of consolidations boosting profits, though it won't be easy to find many
pairs of institutions that dovetail so nicely (and with such compatible
chairmen) as Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover.  But most banks
stand to realize some savings through consolidation, and as their rivals
merge, they may have little choice but to follow suit.  In New England,
Fleet/Norstar's spring acquisition of the failed Bank of New England's
three main units already has raised pressure on the reorganizing Bank of
Boston to join forces with Shawmut National in neighboring Connecticut.

The misfortune for the longer-term development of the industry,
especially in an international context, is that there is little immediate
incentive for mergers of banks in different US markets.  The FDIC's
rejection earlier this year of BankAmerica's strong bid for the BNE units
was shortsighted in this regard because it prevented the creation of the
first major bicoastal institution.  BankAmerica may yet acquire a
subsidiary outside its region, but there are few others inclined to do so
at present.  For now, the main impulse will be consolidation within
regions and in contiguous regions, in anticipation of a US banking
reform bill likely to liberalize branching across state lines.  At some later
date, with the current bank crisis and real estate recession waning, we
may see truly national banks created by a second wave of East-West and
North-South mergers.

Myth and Reality at BCCI

THE MAIN MYTH about BCCI -- which no one has challenged -- is
that it was founded by a Pakistani banker, Agha Hassan Abedi, with Gulf
Arab money.  The truth is that it was founded by Bank of America,
which at the time was trying to build up its presence in the Middle East
and had just failed in an attempt to put together a consortium bank with
Saudi Arabia's NCB and Iran's Bank Saderat.  BoA brought in Abedi,
who had been in Beirut, to head a management team that he ran before
UBP's East Pakistan empire died with the birth of Bangladesh.  That's
no big deal: Lots of Western banks were promoting Middle East banks,
and Abedi very quickly seems to have taken over the show.  But it does
serve to emphasize the layers of obfuscation that now cloud the BCCI
affair.

We put little credence in the rumors that BCCI ran a hit squad in the US
that "eliminated" hostile witnesses, and that BCCI had made direct
payments to several former world leaders.  And the story that a recent
warehouse fire in London destroyed all or a good part of the BCCI
papers taken away from the bank by the SFO and the liquidators at the
time of its closure sounds more like James Bond fiction -- at least, we
hope it is.  More plausible is the story that BCCI paid its non-executive
directors US$200,000 a year -- wildly out of line with standard
compensation for such posts.  And what about the link between London's
highbrow but troubled Cromwell Hospital (favorite of Arab clients for
years) and BCCI?  It seems the original ownership came from BCCI
senior management, and the funding came from the bank as well.  The
relationship is well worth a look, particularly in light of some of the
shenanigans uncovered at the hospital in recent years.

A particularly intriguing published report buried in the BCCI news was
a report from Abu Dhabi suggesting that the second set of books, which
documented the years of fraud, had been located in the UAE.  That just
happens to be where Abedi's No. 2, the mysterious Mr. Naqvi, is
reputed to be now (in fact, we suspect Naqvi is more likely in Pakistan
with his erstwhile boss).

Whatever the case, the report serves to focus attention on just what the
fraud in question was.  Given the secrecy attached to the various Price
Waterhouse reports -- as many as 10, of which those of last October and
this June were most important -- the answer to this critical question is not
clear, though presumably Leigh-Pemberton has finally told the sheikh.
But we see three separate problems:

* a shuffling of assets from low- to high-regulation jurisdictions
whenever a bit of window dressing was necessary to pull the wool over
the bureaucrats of the bank's "college" of regulators -- something that we
are assured has been known in its entirety to the BoE and PW for at least
two years;

* the non-recording of deposits, probably to assist clients in avoiding
VAT and corporate taxes, primarily in the UK -- which inevitably led to
a dual booking system (and which was also, we are told, well known to
the BoE; and

* a very dodgy loan book, including unsecured or inadequately secured
loans to insiders, influential Gulf families, Pakistani shipping interests
and apparently fictitious names.

The official BoE position seems to be that, while BCCI was thought
merely to have a solvency problem, doing a deal with Sheikh Zayed to
pour more money in was acceptable.  But as soon as there was
irrefutable evidence of fraud, that deal had to be dumped and the bank
closed -- no matter that Sheikh Zayed feels he was duped or that 1.5
million depositors worldwide may have lost their money.
The problem is that there are so many holes in this argument that one
scarcely knows where to begin.  First, contrary to the BoE's official
interpretation, the 1987 Banking Act does not need proof of fraud before
a bank is closed -- just strong evidence that it is in trouble.  There was
nothing to stop the BoE from acting earlier if it had wanted. (And under
the act, neither it nor its agents can be sued except in the most dire
circumstances.)  Second, we know for a fact that the BoE had plenty of
evidence on at least the first of the three frauds as early as mid-1988, so
it could have acted then.  And don't forget that it has had its own
management, seconded from Lloyds Bank, in place since early this year.
Third, given that the Urdu mafia around Abedi had been cleaned out last
year, there is no reason to believe that the fraud situation at BCCI was
actually getting worse in 1991 -- indeed, everything we hear suggests it
was getting better.

So why did the BoE act?  One suggestion is that Leigh-Pemberton did
not appreciate the consequences, but that is too insulting to accept.  Less
incredible is the possibility that Luxembourg didn't know what might
happen, and that it pushed the button first.  Or maybe the US regulators
(or FBI) prompted action.  Our own suspicion is that the initiative came
from Price Waterhouse, whose position in the whole affair is both crucial
and equivocal.

PW audited half of BCCI even before 1987, when it was awarded a
worldwide contract at the behest of the BoE (and apparently at a fee of
around STG1 million a year).  In the last two years, it has done around
10 supplemental reports for the BoE, the last two of which (and perhaps
others) have contained evidence of fraud sufficient for the authorities to
shut the bank down.  Prior to the 1990 accounts (which are still
unpublished), however, PW did not choose to qualify its approval, except
in ways that few professionals would have spotted.  In the last 18
months, poor Sheikh Zayed -- who is utterly blameless in this -- poured
about US$2 billion into BCCI as the Pakistanis got out with their loot.

Now, the auditor (in the US and the UK) works for the shareholder --
not the regulators and not the depositors.  So, PW might well have asked
itself, should it tell Sheikh Zayed what it is finding in its investigations
for the BoE, since those findings mean that it will be unable to approve
the accounts and since they will almost certainly force the authorities to
close BCCI?  In particular, shouldn't PW have told Sheikh Zayed enough
to stop him pouring money into the bank that he is most unlikely to get
back?  Clearly, PW was in a difficult situation -- but it is significant that,
two days before the bank was closed and after the June 27 date on which
PW handed over its final report to the BoE, Sheikh Zayed pumped
another US$660 million into BCCI.  One can well imagine near-panic at
PW: After all, they, the auditors, were at that point unequivocally in
possession of information that would render that capital injection
worthless in the very near future.  Might PW not have said to the Bank,
"Act, or we will go public"?

Certainly, PW does not emerge covered in glory.  It appears to have
gotten itself in a dreadful pickle between its twin responsibilities: to the
shareholders in the normal course of (very lucrative) audit business, and
to the BoE in the course of special studies that directly impinged on the
audit side.  Maybe it was wrong of the Bank to entrust the same firm
with both tasks.  But the Bank has more to answer for than that.
Whatever soothing words Leigh-Pemberton and Brian Quinn gave to the
Gulf rulers, the fact is that the BoE effectively allowed Sheikh Zayed to
pour huge amounts of good money after bad, knowing all the while that
a closure was almost inevitable whatever pledge might have been made.
That's shoddy treatment, at best.

A Not-so-precious Metal?

THE FACT that gold funds in the US turned in an impressive 8.04%
gain in the second quarter has bolstered optimism that the market has
turned the corner.  But what we find more intriguing is the shift in
emphasis -- notably in Kathryn Welling's thoughtful analysis in this
week's Barron's, which predicts improved prices in the second half --
to define gold increasingly as little more than a commodity subject to
forces no different than those that apply to copper and wheat.

Traditionalists would doubtless argue that recent political change in South
Africa and the lifting of US sanctions have also had a positive impact,
and there is surely some truth in that.  But Welling's analysis still points
up a fundamental change from the gold bug arguments common during
the last runup of prices from 1976-79.  Traditional reasons to buy gold
were to hedge against rising inflation and consequent loss of value in
paper currency, reinforced by the more extreme scenario of a sharp
depreciation of other assets as a result of major political disturbances.
But Welling puts the case for a new price rise in more basic terms:
Demand for gold, especially for jewelry, continues to rise, and supply
cannot keep pace given the high marginal costs of expanded production.

An IR editor who addressed a congregation of gold bugs in the 1970s
recalls the hoots of derision that greeted a lonely heretic who ventured
to note that surging prices might depress jewelry demand.  At the time,
this area of the market was considered trivial compared with the
apparently inexhaustible demand for gold for financial purposes.  Now
the outlook is different: In 1989, jewelry demand for gold overtook
Western mine production, and the gap widened last year.  Evidently the
industry has taken notice: The World Gold Council is a primary sponsor
for a current exhibit of rare African gold jewelry at the Chicago Art
Institute.

So why has gold become a commodity?  The reason is that it's now
widely realized that paper money can have value when issued by a
central bank that keeps the money supply under tight control.  This
perception differs fundamentally from the traditional view that paper
money (including bank deposits) can never have ultimate value unless it
is redeemable in gold.  In fact, investors have shown no reluctance to
hold dollars, DM or other hard currencies because it is universally
recognized that central banks in the key industrialized countries will act
responsibly to control money supply.  Hard lessons from inflationary
experience have definitively refuted any "greenback" theories that
governments can simply print unlimited amounts of money without
affecting its value.

With these lessons learned, gold -- earning no interest and requiring
storage costs -- looks less attractive as an investment, save purely as a
commodity.  Even the threat of war or rising inflation is no longer
enough to set off a rush into gold -- the dollar is generally the preferred
safe haven.  Hence the Gulf crisis produced surprisingly modest
movement in the price of gold.

Today, many traders in silver look to tableware instead of coinage for
guidance on demand.  Perhaps gold bugs will be more reluctant to
undergo complete conversion -- but it's not too early to pay closer
attention to how gold rings and necklaces are moving at the retail jewelry
shops.

UNITED STATES

GREENSPAN'S testimony before Congress confirms that Fed bank
president hawks in the FOMC have taken a back seat on monetary
policy.  Although Greenspan's forecast of economic growth next year in
a range of 2.25-3.0% is below the administration forecast at 3.6%, he
pointedly chose to keep present money supply targets at 2.5-6.5%.  The
anti-inflation zealots would have preferred to lower the band a notch, but
the 0.3% fall in the June PPI hardly supports their case -- and the 0.2%
CPI rise last month scarcely appears grounds for panic.

Greenspan conceded, as most corporate borrowers could confirm, that
the credit crunch persists -- and there's no guarantee that the situation
will get better in the near term.  In this context, the Chemical/Manny
Hanny marriage unveiled this week -- and the certain prospect of more
mergers to follow (see the lead editorial in this issue) -- could prolong
and conceivably even exacerbate the crunch in the short term, for two
reasons:

* parties to coming mergers will want to wash their hands of lending by
the other party that looks unwise or possibly vulnerable to regulatory
difficulties; and

* in many cases, loan officers fearful for their jobs will be inclined to sit
on their assets until they get a clearer picture of the new chain of
command and its revamped lending priorities.

The 5.2% rise in June housing starts is obviously good news, reinforcing
the anecdotal evidence that lower interest rates have given a boost to
residential construction.  But the recovery in the sector remains fragile
-- one more reason why the Fed will be cautious about raising interest
rates in the near term.  The 0.7% rise in industrial production for June
was skewed by a surge in auto and truck output, behind the 3.7% jump
in the consumer goods category.  Business equipment, excluding autos
and trucks, showed no change (remember too that some "fleet sales" of
vehicles quickly feed through to the consumer market).  Thus far, the
recovery seems to be stronger in consumer-based categories like housing
than in the business investment sector.  One gloomy projection based on
that dichotomy is that employment will show little improvement in the
near term -- and could even decline further -- though rising spending
power for workers will be sufficient to offset declining demand from the
unemployed.  The implicit risk in this scenario is that, unless
productivity picks up, lower profit margins and lower investment will be
the end result, undercutting the nascent recovery.  We do not view such
an outcome as inevitable -- but it's worth noting that a recovery driven
largely by the consumer economy threatens to exacerbate the existing
distortions caused by the relatively low savings rate of the US.  And
higher real long-term interest rates as global demand for capital
intensifies could further undercut business investment.

President Bush offered vague commitments in London to press forward
with the Uruguay Round -- but behind the reassuring rhetoric is a drift
in Washington toward the same sort of protectionism that the US is
pressing Brussels to abandon.  That suggests that the administration may
seek to use the North American FTA as a vehicle to introduce tougher
restrictions on imports from outside the proposed trading bloc.  A critical
issue is whether the new FTA will contain tougher foreign content
restrictions to prevent Japanese and European exporters and investors
from stealing under the umbrella of the trade pact.  Already US
automakers are complaining about liberal interpretations as to "national
content" in Canadian-built cars -- and we can expect such issues to be
pressed with greater urgency regarding Japanese- and European-owned
companies in Mexico.  That could lead to establishment of more uniform
tariff treatment for imports into North America -- another step down the
road toward major regional trading blocs.

TIGHTENING UP ON THE BANKS

In contrast to pending House legislation that less charitable observers
deride as a "widows, orphans and bankers relief bill," the Senate
Banking Committee draft released this week grants less new turf to the
banks and asks more in return.  Still, the "committee print" fashioned by
committee chairman Donald Riegle (D-Mich.) is consistent in key
respects with the Brady reform plan.  It includes two essential elements
of the White house proposal -- repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act separating
commercial and investment banking and authorization of interstate
branching -- albeit with provisos on both.  But the Riegle draft would not
allow ownership of banks by commercial enterprises and would continue
to bar entry by federally chartered banks into the insurance business.

Maintenance of the existing barrier to business ownership of banks could
amount to de facto continuance of Glass-Steagall, as so many securities
houses are subsidiaries of major corporations.  And the Senate bill is
much more restrictive than the House version on deposit insurance.  It
does not propose to cut back coverage of individuals from present levels,
but it would eliminate protection of brokered deposits.  The industry is
sure to mount heavy resistance as well to the provision for a special
assessment to cover the first US$10 billion pumped into the Bank
Insurance Fund.  Big banks will object in particular to the inclusion of
foreign as well as domestic deposits in the assessment base.

Some of the Riegle bill's sterner provisions may fall away in eventual
House-Senate conference talks on the final bill.  But commercial control
of banks, also vigorously opposed by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.),
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, may well be
doomed.  It is also vulnerable to the populist argument (exaggerated, but
not entirely unfounded) that letting big companies buy banks would
concentrate economic power and dramatically raise taxpayer exposure in
the event of failures.

Provisions in the draft Senate bill that would impinge on Fed and
Treasury discretion in stabilizing big banks in trouble also are likely to
be watered down.  The Riegle draft would bar the rescue of large banks
as "too big to fail," and limit discount window assistance.  In the end,
however, monetary officials are likely to be left with wide discretion
here.  Democrats in both the House and Senate may well oblige the
maintenance of provisions obliging banks to provide services to low-
income consumers.

CANADA

THE MULRONEY government is going Gramm-Rudman in a big way
--  if more for political expediency than budgetary rigor.  FM Don
Mazankowski used a visit to his home province of Alberta to announce
plans for a 3% cap on annual federal spending, with Parliament barred
from hiking taxes or authorizing new borrowings to push spending above
that limit.  The Spending Control Act would cover all federal
expenditures except debt service, and would be applied on a government-
wide basis -- which means above-target increases in entitlements such as
social welfare or unemployment benefits would have to be offset by
compensating cutbacks elsewhere in other federal departments.

It is no accident that the FM broke the news in Alberta, the hotbed of the
surging Reform Party, whose otherwise vague and unfocused rightist
platform has one clear plank -- strict controls on government
expenditures.  The Reformists are ahead of the ruling Tories in the polls
nationally and far ahead in Alberta.  Cabinet ministers like Mazankowski
and high-profile Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe Clark may be safe,
but private polls show that other Alberta-based Tories would be wiped
out if elections were held now.

It appears doubtful whether Mazankowski's gambit can reverse the Tory
slide in the West, but odds for approval in Ottawa appear favorable --
likely before yearend.  Under the law, a five-year spending ceiling would
be set at Can$615.3 billion.  If spending projections in a given budget
exceed the yearly levels implicit in the five-year limit, the FM would be
compelled to establish how the government plans to compensate for the
overrun in future years.  Budgets that do not comply with mandated
spending limits could be approved only if Parliament rescinds the act
itself.

Gadfly Quebec businessman Glen Kealey -- well known nationwide as a
constant fixture who conducts his one-man protests almost daily outside
Parliament -- has become far more than just a nuisance to the Tory
government.  The doggedly persistent Kealey, whose rage stems from
alleged attempts by several Quebec Tories to extract bribes in exchange
for commitment of federal offices to his planned office complex across
the river from Ottawa, surprised the political cynics by persuading the
courts to bring charges of fraud and corruption against Sports Minister
Pierre Cadieux, three former ministers, the RCMP commissioner, several
senators and other Tory party officials.  Several targets of Kealey's wrath
already have been convicted on other charges; several more left the
cabinet with their political careers ruined.  The new charges will be
investigated by the local police, and some big Tory names could face
trial; Kealey first complained to the RCMP, but the federal agency found
evidence supporting the charges to be insufficient.

Economists are convinced the recession is over, but some leading
business executives fear that the economy could slip into a double-bottom
recession if the present upward momentum proves unsustainable.  For
now, the recovery scenario looks secure: Manufacturing shipments
increased by 0.9% in May to Can$23.3 billion, the third straight monthly
gain after a string of declines.  Granted, the gain was well below the 2%
rise in April, and most of the expansion was concentrated in the auto and
wood industries.  But combined with other economic indicators, it points
to an improving trend that should persuade the BoC to keep short-term
rates steady.

JAPAN

THE EFFECTS of the brokerage scandal may persist long after the
embarrassing disclosures end, and could knock the wind out of an
economy that is already looking tired.  No one is talking about an
outright recession: On the contrary, with just two months to go, the
current expansion is certain to surpass the record 57-month Izanagi boom
of the 1960s.  But most economists now doubt that real GNP will meet
the official target of 3.8% growth in the fiscal 1991 year through next
March.  The latest forecast revisions show inflation-adjusted growth of
3.0-3.5% in FY 1991.  Moreover, the likelihood that activity in Europe
--  a major customer of Japanese exports in recent quarters -- will continue
to slow suggests that the external sector may no longer offset weakness
in the domestic economy.

The immediate cause for concern is the newly foundering stock market,
which plunged to a 1991 low earlier this month and remains unsteady
over the 23,000 level.  Since Japanese banks may book unrealized profits
on equities holdings as capital, fluctuations of the Nikkei directly affect
their ability to meet the 8% capital adequacy requirement that the BIS
has set for the end of March 1993.  Last August, as the recovering
Tokyo Stock Exchange stalled and headed south again, only three of the
12 city banks had met the new standard.  However, the next phase of the
rally hatched in January pushed all but one over the threshold at the end
of FY 1990 on March 31.  At current levels, stock prices are 15% below
the 1991 peak of 27,147 on March 18.

The Ministry of Finance's largely symbolic response to the securities
scandal has done little to reassure investors or restore its flagging
credibility.  Last week, the Big Four securities houses began a
"voluntary" punishment -- a four-day suspension of soliciting business
from corporate clients.  FM Hashimoto, who previously denied
responsibility for the incident, subsequently reversed his position and
acknowledged that faulty oversight may have been a contributing factor.
The penalty: a three-month pay cut of 10% for himself (which translates
to a sum of US$30,000) and two other MoF officials.  Ironically,
Hashimoto's embarrassment may yield political dividends for PM Kaifu,
whose chances of retaining the LDP presidency and the top job in
October have thus improved.

The BIS rule and slumping TSE are squeezing banks anew and reducing
their ability to lend.  Now that equity financing is not a viable
alternative, major banks are rushing to obtain massive amounts of
subordinated loans from life insurance companies.  Sumitomo Bank, for
example, is seeking to borrow Y40-50 billion through this avenue.  At
worst, this could become a new source of pressure on stocks and crimp
corporations, which face rationing of credit needed to fund investment.

Significantly, the Bank of Japan's half-point cut in the discount rate on
July 1 was designed to refuel the economy and provide relief to the
teetering Nikkei.  Thus, the fallout from the brokerage scandal has
probably nullified the stimulative effect of lower interest rates.  Indeed,
all but two of 18 economic research institutes, which published revised
economic forecasts this week, believe that further easing of monetary
policy is required to sustain the expansion.

Warning signs are emanating from a variety of sources:
* Corporate bankruptcies: The number of first half business failures rose
for the first time in seven years by 60.2% to 4,723 in January-June 1991
from a year ago.   Combined liabilities surged 394.4% to a record
Y3,426.2 billion, surpassing the previous high reached in the first
semester of 1986.  This figure represents 82% of the full-year record
achieved in 1986, and assures that a historic high will be set for all of
1991.  Most of the increase in liabilities resulted from the collapse of
"bubble" companies that speculated heavily in equities and real estate.

* Foreign trade: The merchandise trade surplus widened in June for the
sixth consecutive month.  Measured year-on-year, the surplus grew 8.9%
to US$7.26 billion, as 6.9% growth in exports outpaced the 6.1% rise
in imports.  However, the bilateral balance with the US fell 17.9% -- a
reflection both of the relative strength of the yen and the weak US
economy.  Consequently, Japanese companies are likely to renew their
bid for American pocketbooks, which could draw new protectionist
reprisals from Washington.

The improving trade balance elsewhere carries the same political risk.
In the 12 months through June, the surplus soared 48.5% to US$2.64
billion with the EC and 20.3% to US$3.44 billion with Southeast Asian
countries.  In Europe, French PM Edith Cresson is leading the rhetorical
attack on Tokyo, while complaints are emerging from both Seoul and
Taiwan.  Thus, researchers at LTCB expect the current account surplus
to expand sharply from US$33.8 billion in FY 1990 to US$58.6 billion
this year, but to contract by 9% in FY 1992 in line with the shrinking
trade surplus.

* Monetary growth: The key M2+CDs measure rose a modest 3.5% in
May from a year ago, down nearly 10 percentage points from the peak
rate of 13% in the first quarter of 1990.  The BoJ insists that this pace
is sufficient to sustain economic activity, and expects the money supply
to show a 4% increase in April-June -- we have our doubts.

* Business investment: A new Small Business Credit Insurance Corp.
survey reveals that planned plant and equipment spending by small and
medium-size companies will drop 6.8% in the current fiscal year amid
increasing caution about the economic outlook.  Asahi Mutual expects
overall capital spending to grow just 1.1% in January-June 1991 from
the previous half year, and by a relatively modest 2.2% in July-
December.

The BoJ's 25-month regimen of tight credit will continue to reduce
inflation pressures.  Overall wholesale prices fell 0.1% in June from
May and rose an enviable 0.6% from a year earlier; since 1985, the WPI
has fallen 9%.  LTCB economists foresee no more than 1% wholesale
inflation and 2% retail inflation in the latter half of FY 1991 on the basis
of stable crude oil prices and moderate wage growth.  Taken together,
anemic activity, restrained growth in prices and the money supply and
a foundering stock market increase the prospects for another cut in the
official discount rate, currently 5.5%, by the end of September.

GERMANY

THE DECISION of the Bundesbank to lower the target for monetary
aggregate growth has blown the cover on the attempt in Frankfurt and
Bonn to play down the deepening rift over monetary policy.  The
decision to lower the top end of the money supply band to 5% is a direct
response to the failure of FM Theo Waigel and Economy Minister
Juergen Moellemann to make headway on subsidy and other spending
cuts.  IR sources say the only reason the Bundesbank chose not to hike
rates last week is that it didn't want to embarrass Waigel on the eve of
the London summit, where a German rate hike would have been
enormously unpopular -- though it seems eminently plausible that the
massive coordinated CB intervention in support of the DM one day after
the Bundesbank meeting was the quid pro quo for standing pat.

Market sources in Frankfurt anticipate an upward bias in interest rates
to the end of the summer.  The central concern at the Bundesbank
remains the budget: BB analysts dismiss Finance Ministry claims that the
federal share of PSBR will fall by 50% to DM25 billion in 1995 as
irrelevant, and forecast total new public debt will reach at least DM160
billion by that year.  That's not counting "shadow budgets" and other
hidden outlays taken off budget, notably the Treuhand and Hermes-
backed credit lines to the USSR.

Schlesinger's immediate concerns are twofold:

* FX reserves at the BB have fallen by DM10 billion thus far in 1991,
narrowing the margin of comfort for future intervention.  The
coordinated July 12 operation proved a huge success -- but Schlesinger
is well aware that such broad support, particularly from the Fed, cannot
be counted on if the DM comes under renewed pressure.

* The June inflation numbers were bad enough, and Schlesinger fears the
July results could be worse -- albeit largely due to the one-off impact of
the tax increases that took effect July 1.

Heightened pressure on the FX and inflation fronts would significantly
narrow the odds for a Bundesbank rate hike, regardless of Bonn's desire
to hold off.  And rising interest rates would also intensify pressure on
Waigel to consider new fiscal actions.  Wilhelm Noelling of the
Hamburg LZB already is publicly touting hefty taxes on real estate
holdings and capital assets as the only effective means to transfer wealth
from west Germany to the ex-GDR.  Noelling's view is still tainted by
association with the Hamburg SPD's weakness for giveaways to the East
-- but the endorsement of several economic institutes has broadened the
political base of support for new fiscal actions.  Any movement in that
direction, however, clashes head-on with the palpable unpopularity in the
West of the tax rises already in place -- and it's impossible to conceive
of Bonn implementing fiscal adjustments that could prevent the PSBR
from moving steadily higher.

Further repercussions of the Karlsruhe decision. Tax lawyers who have
seen the 60-page Supreme Court verdict call the decision a landmark
victory for fiscal authorities -- and a stinging defeat for rights to privacy
in banking transactions.  In the political arena, the ruling CDU is
inclined to opt for spot tax audits as the most efficient -- and least
financially damaging -- response to the court ruling.  It also appears to
favor a deductible limit of DM2,000 for interest income.  But neither the
party nor the government thus far has provided sufficient clarification of
its position on the Karlsruhe ruling, and that alone could unsettle
investors.  The opposition SPD has taken advantage of the confusion by
spelling out a more clear-cut policy that rules out reintroduction of
withholding tax on interest income, establishes higher deduction limits
for small investors, and calls for aggressive efforts to assure greater
conformity in tax laws throughout the EC.  The SPD also would favor
spot audits over more sweeping tax controls.

Banks will be forced to relax secrecy requirements, but will seek Bonn's
commitment to broaden exemptions for interest income on the (somewhat
self-serving) grounds that lower taxes would make voluntary controls
more workable.  Specifically, the industry will lobby for much bigger tax
exemptions up to DM6,000 for single and DM12,000 for joint returns.
The trouble is that the standard tax deduction for wages currently is set
at just DM2,000 -- and it will be difficult to make a case for giving
preferential treatment to interest income.  Also expect the small banks --
without links to Luxembourg or offshore subsidiaries -- to press for
uniformity in rules for interest taxation throughout the EC, which
Deutsche, Commerzbank and Dresdner are more likely to oppose to
protect their interests abroad.

THE MERTENS AFFAIR

Two weeks after allegations of insider trading abuses in the newsletter
Effecten-Spiegel triggered action at Deutsche Bank against a key figure
in the case, the affair is burgeoning.  Prosecutors are now investigating
Thomas Fluegel, a crony of Manfred Mertens, the DB securities official
sacked for violating "internal regulations" of the bank.  Prosecutors have
raided Fluegel's office and are now sifting through documents for
evidence to support allegations that Mertens was embezzling from his
employer -- purportedly by skimming payments for securities deals that
turned a profit, while chalking up losses to DB.  IR sources also report
that Deutsche is restructuring its securities trading operations to prevent
its employees from conducting one-man operations at its expense.

The latest twist is part of an increasingly tangled web of allegations.
Fluegel was a former employee of the Frankfurt securities trader
Ohms/Schmidt, until Schmidt and Fluegel quit and joined forces.  Ohms,
not touched in the most recent affair, was the former employer of
Joachim Schmidt, the securities trader who gained notoriety in the VW
securities scandal.  A report in the business magazine Wirtschaftswoche
claims that Poehl's former secretary, who was fired after allegedly
providing Schmidt with information about dollar interventions, was later
hired by Ohms.

UNITED KINGDOM

The half-point cut in interest rates, courtesy of the Bundesbank, came on
schedule.  And the enthusiasm of the markets may convince Chancellor
Lamont to go for another half-point cut before the new Schlesinger-era
Bundesbank Council reconvenes at the beginning of September.  The
FTSE has surged, the gilts market has suspended disbelief, and
economists like Gavyn Davies (whose ideological bent is to the left) are
saying that there is finally light at the end of the tunnel.

But hold on.  For once, we side with the CBI, whose latest
pronouncement is that "brutal" anti-inflation policies (strongly supported
at the time by the CBI) have set back growth prospects for years.  We
don't see any sign of the recession ending: Indeed, in some key sectors,
the other shoe is still to fall.  The most vulnerable is property: the
Stanhope/Rosehaugh merger is a sign of weakness, not recovery.  In
central London, 15% of office space supply is now unoccupied, and
empty office space in the capital has increased by 6.2 million square feet
in the last six months alone.  Plus, there is still a huge amount of new
building about to come on the market -- with no realistic chance of
finding tenants.  Whether base rates are 11% or 11.5% is irrelevant to
the plight of these developers: Another half-point cut won't stop some
very nasty collapses.

And the banks stand to suffer from the property fallout.  The
conventional wisdom is that the clearers are in for a bonanza -- after five
years of retrenchment, it is felt, they are leaner and more bottom-line
oriented.  As the economy recovers, it is argued, bank profits will soar.
Well, maybe -- but only because bank accounting is exceptionally
creative and they are going to have to raise capital for Basel.  The truth
is that all the clearers are sitting on real estate loans that are
nonperforming, underperforming or outright worthless -- and they will
have to take the hit sometime.  Lamont's anticipated report exonerating
the clearers from operating a cartel to the detriment of small business
could well reinforce the feel-good tendency among the banks -- but in
our view, the optimism is premature.

As for gilts, the message seems to be that, despite the expectation of
higher growth, inflationary expectations are falling even faster -- and
gilts are, therefore, a solid bet.  But note that the markets are looking
very selectively at the price data: The fact is that retail prices are stuck
at 5.8% and that core output inflation is running at 6%.  And forecasts
of 3.5% by Christmas, despite a pickup in growth, are wildly optimistic.
Plus, the improvement in the June PSBR to "only" STG1.41 billion,
from STG3.52 billion in May, is a one-off improvement: Had it not been
for receipts from the Scottish power selloff, the amount would have been
almost STG2.6 billion.  Given the doubts about the government's ability
to sell off the residue of BT as it had expected in the autumn, the PSBR
for FY 1991-92, which is slated at STG8 billion, could well come in at
closer to STG12-13 billion -- and that will offset even a substantial
improvement in inflation.

Finally two pointers:

* Barclays's new ECU issue of subordinated notes (a private placement
to Asian investors) will be the first of several such calls as clearers look
for capital to meet Basel ratios.  The ECU market is underdeveloped for
UK institutions, and there is real potential there.

* The front-runner to succeed Robin Leigh-Pemberton, whose stock has
taken a tumble as a result of BCCI, is SIB's David Walker.  As an
outsider, he has remained untainted by the BCCI affair -- unlike Eddie
George, who might normally get the nod.  As a former insider, he would
be better able to clean house under a Labour government than someone
like David Scholey.  Plus, he is a genuinely impressive intellect.

MIDLAND IN MOSCOW

The Financial Times investigation into the activities of a Midland Bank
trade subsidiary in the arms business, and the revelation of its links to
the world of British spookery -- not to mention losses close to STG100
million over 10 years -- is yet another bizarre banking story that could
run and run.  Moreover, the emerging evidence indicates close traditional
links between boardrooms at a number of clearing banks (and one or two
merchant banks) and the intelligence community, though Midland may
be the only one to have had its senior staff commit "suicide" in Moscow.
What must have present managements worried is just how easy it seems
to have been to lose MITS within the Midland organizational structure:
Kit McMahon is no fool, but it took him at least a couple of years to
identify a division that was apparently losing money like Bank of New
England.  A couple of questions to the auditor might not be amiss: What
are they paid for, after all?

GOVERNMENT FOR SALE

Transatlantic observers begin by accepting the British picture of
themselves as squeaky-clean, which only heightens their incredulity when
the venality of British politics and business is exposed to view.  A good
case in point is the decision by British Airways' boss, Lord King, to
withhold his company's regular STG40,000 contribution to the Tory
party because the DTI and Department of Transport have decided to open
up BA's cozy near-monopoly of long-haul routes out of Heathrow to
competition -- particularly from Virgin's Richard Branson.  In the US,
this kind of corporate donation  goes through a PAC and is decently (if
ingenuously) clothed in some sort of ideological garb -- free markets, fair
trade, Japan-bashing, whatever.  In the UK, it is right up front -- hence
King's decision.  What is more outrageous is that, by and large, the
British press has applauded King for his frankness -- but then the press
has a pretty relaxed view of its perks, too.

CRIME PAYS

Latest evidence that the UK courts are hopelessly naive comes from the
decision just handed down against the four principals in the Garton
Amhurst case, who got between 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 years in jail for fleecing
clients quite shamelessly of at least STG4.7 million over 10 years.  The
four, who were barely in their 20s when the scam started, will do 12-24
months with good behavior -- and will then have to forego the pleasures
of being a company director for another couple of years.  Most
outrageous, the judge accepted that they had salted nothing away for this
kind of rainy day, and hence made no restitution order against them.
That seems more like Colombian than English justice.

SWITZERLAND

EXPECTATIONS that inflation will remain stubbornly high through the
summer -- with the year-on-year index climbing in June to its highest
level in nearly a decade, at 6.6% -- have dampened investor interest in
the SF bond market.  The falloff in new issues as the summer break
begins also has hurt the market.  Current prices already discount an
anticipated fall in inflation to 4.5% by yearend, and leading analysts at
Swiss banks expect SF bond yields to hold near present levels to
yearend.

The consensus among Zurich bankers is that investors would do better
to move now to lengthen maturity profiles in SF fixed-income portfolios
-- those who wait could find supply short when the market takes a more
dramatic upturn.  From a technical perspective, another good play in
Zuerich at present is Japanese equity warrants, currently recommended
by CS director Pierre Andre Chappallaz.  In recent weeks, warrant
values have declined from a 20% to 14% premium, which has made this
sector competitive with other currency warrants.  Chappallaz warns,
however, that persistent political uncertainty in Japan could lead to
further depreciation in value.

Bank Vontobel also is advising investors to reduce liquidity in all
currencies.  Jean-Pierre Rothenbuehler, head of the bank's advisory
department for private clients, views DM investments as likely to remain
the most solid in Europe, but prefers Euro-DM to the domestic Bund
market.  Vontobel analysts are concerned at the pall cast over the
domestic market by the recent constitutional court decision regarding
taxation of interest income.  The result could be a split in the DM bond
market, with prices falling for Bunds but rising for Euro-DM issues.

As for the Swiss stock market, currently near its 1991 high, Vontobel
anticipates little movement over the next several weeks, with the
economic slowdown and slower-than-anticipated improvement on the
inflation front already factored into pricing.  The market will regain its
upward momentum only with a significant drop in interest rates and
improved Swiss corporate earnings, bolstered by recent favorable
movements in SF exchange rates against the dollar and the yen.

A new study of prospective Swiss economic integration with Europe by
Peter Meier, chief economic analyst at Zurcher Kantonalbank, sees
significant advantage in the potentially enhanced stability that EMS
alignment could bring to the Swiss franc.  In Meier's view, full Swiss
integration in the EMS would appear a logical extension of present EC
movement toward monetary union.  But SNB Governor Markus Lusser
remains skeptical over the perceived benefits in closer SF alignment with
the EMS.  In our view, however, the SNB's dream of monetary policy
independence from Germany appears impossible to realize in the present
environment.

On interest rates, Meier foresees no fall in domestic mortgage rates at
least until Euro-SF rates begin to slide more sharply.  Three-month
Euro-SF rates, currently around 7 13/16-7 15/16%, should ease by
around half a point by yearend, but ZKB analysts view that fall as
insufficient to influence mortgage rates.

Don't expect any further substantial improvement in the Swiss trade
deficit to yearend, as softening in export sales abroad should offset an
anticipated falloff in import demand.  In the first half, the trade deficit
declined by 8% against the year-ago period to SF5 billion, while terms
of trade improved due to modest decline in import prices and modest
improvement in average export values.  Widening interest spreads
currently favor the DM -- some Swiss forecasters now anticipate a rise
to SF0.88/DM on the cross by yearend -- but the currency movement is
unlikely to have a major impact on the bilateral balance with
Switzerland's largest key trading partner.  IR expects softened German
demand as a result of the economic slowdown to weaken Swiss exports
to that country in the second half.

The Swiss economic slowdown has taken its toll on federal finances.
The Federal Financial Department in Berne, in revised projections based
on first-half tax income, predicts that the budget will finish the year in
deficit for the first time in five years.  The new forecast contrasts with
an original budget projection of a SF73 million surplus in 1991.
Estimated tax revenues of SF16.2 billion were significantly below
expectations: Direct federal tax income appears likely to come in near
anticipated levels at yearend, but turnover taxes -- the main source of
federal tax revenues -- show a substantial decline.

FRANCE

NOW THAT year-on-year inflation is lower in France than in Germany
for the first time in 18 years, FM Beregovoy sees a widening margin of
comfort to ease credit -- but he will resist political pressure for more
aggressive action.  Provisional data show the June CPI at just 0.2%, with
the year-on-year rate up by 10 bp from May to 3.3%.  But a 0.5%
monthly surge pushed the German CPI up to 3.5% year-on-year in June.
The widely anticipated reversal in the Franco-German inflation
differential is a personal victory for Beregovoy, whose tight-money,
strong-franc policies over the past three years have steadily slowed price
growth.

France should retain the inflation edge over Germany at least until the
end of the year, given expectations of stable French inflation around 3%
and persistent reconstruction pressures on German prices.  But
Beregovoy and the Bank of France are taking a cautious line on interest
rates, despite mounting political pressure to ease monetary policy to
prime the economy.  French growth was flat in the first quarter and is
expected to remain sluggish at 1.5% for all of 1991, down from 2.8%
in 1990.

The BoF's benchmark rates, the money market intervention rate and the
repurchase rate for five- to 10-day securities, have held steady at 9% and
10%, respectively, since March 18.  The rates are applied by the central
bank on its advances of liquidity to the banking system and are generally
regarded as the lower and upper limits for daily movement by short-term
market-determined rates.  The BoF's quarter-point cut of key rates last
October was quickly followed by German monetary tightening that sent
the franc into dangerous territory, briefly over FF3.4200; the BoF now
appears firmly committed to holding the line at FF3.40.

Advocates of immediate easing gained additional ammunition with the
continued fall in housing starts to the end of the first quarter.  The
downward trend is expected to continue through the summer, despite a
recent pickup in construction permits.  The volume of houses completed
in 1990 rose by just 1.6% after a rise of 5.4% in 1989, while spending
on house purchases and building improvements rose by a feeble 0.2%.
Developers reported a sharp rise in housing inventory to FF7.1 billion
in 1990, from FF2.4 billion the year before.

SABENA'S FATE

The EC Commission will decide next week whether to approve a
proposed Belgian government aid package of BF35 billion to help
restructure struggling national air carrier Sabena.  The issue is seen as
important since the EC is taking an increasingly dim view of subsidies,
and last year heavily criticized Air France and UK-based Rover for
hidden subsidy arrangements.  The Commission previously has indicated
that it would approve a Sabena bailout only if:

* it is a one-time operation, ruling out any future aid for the airline; and

* Sabena's monopoly on routes to Brussels's Zaventem international
airport is dismantled and access is granted to other airlines.

The Commission is understood to believe that the Belgian government
has gone a long way toward meeting conditions for the aid.  The package
would include a BF16.2 billion writeoff of long-term debt and would be
extended in two phases.  An initial installment of BF10 billion would be
paid immediately upon Commission approval, mainly to finance up to
3,000 layoffs.

A BREAK IN THE FARM IMPASSE?

EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry has come up with a new
plan designed to take large amounts of land out of production.  The
comprehensive reform program is designed to encourage farmers to retire
early, tempted by lump-sum payments and pension plans.  Those staying
on would face a 35% cut in the Community's guaranteed prices, a 15%
cut in support prices for beef, and a 4% cut in the EC milk quota over
the next three years.  The scheme would cost the EC budget almost
STG3 billion in compensation to farmers over three years -- but
MacSharry argues that would be modest relative to the cost of
perpetuating the present subsidy system.

SOVIET UNION

CAN THE WEST avoid paying for perestroika?  The G7 managed to
politely fend off Gorbachev's financial pleas at the London summit: The
six-point program for the future is skillfully and carefully crafted to put
the emphasis on technical assistance and macroeconomic monitoring by
the multilaterals.  But it should already be obvious that -- even if foreign
capital makes inroads in select areas such as energy, mining and
aerospace,   and  even  if  the  Soviet  Parliament  and  the  republics
adopt the necessary legal framework for development of the private
economy -- the need for more substantial financial aid will remain acute.

The key to the future of the Soviet economy -- assuming it is not ripped
apart by nationalist movements -- remains privatization.  But the
transition to a market economy will be long and difficult: Production will
continue to plummet in the interim, existing distribution patterns will be
disrupted, and living standards will slide further.

The conundrum is that Western leaders tacitly recognize Gorbachev's
great experiment -- and his government -- could come crashing down if
he cannot raise the capital abroad to finance a more ambitious and
accelerated market transformation, yet they are reluctant to make massive
financial commitments.  The G7's insistence on a more specific and
viable blueprint for reform is understandable -- but the risk is that the
transformation will be stopped dead in its tracks while the West quibbles
over the details of the program.  Sweeping Soviet capitulations on global
policy from Eastern Europe to arms control of the magnitude agreed by
Gorbachev would have been inconceivable a decade ago -- and
Gorbachev's defenders would argue that the G7 would ultimately be
doing itself a favor by more generously assisting the transition to a
capitalist economy.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA

EXPECT a reasonably good economic performance for 1991, despite
predictable setbacks in the transition to a market economy.  Like its East
European neighbors, Czechoslovakia has suffered economic damage from
lost oil imports and Mideast contracts as a result of the Gulf crisis, as
well as from disruption of trade with the Soviet Union.  But Prague has
fared better in weathering the storm -- and while FM Vacalv Klaus warns
against premature optimism, government officials express satisfaction
with the progress made toward economic stabilization thus far.

Jaromir Zahradnik, vice president of the National Bank, notes that the
koruna exchange rate has stabilized and that inflation has been brought
under control after an initial surge following price decontrol at the start
of the year.  The CPI, which surged to 26% monthly in January,
dropped below 2% in May.  Unemployment has remained moderate at
around 3% of the workforce, in contrast to much higher levels in
neighboring countries.  Prague is proceeding with careful but
fundamental reform of the banking and financial systems.  State subsidies
for unprofitable enterprises are gradually being phased out, and
bankruptcies are certain to follow.

On balance, Prague's go-slowly approach to reform appears to have
produced less economic disruption and political turmoil than Warsaw's
more sweeping strategy.  Whether that is a matter of superior economic
management is another  question -- clearly Czechoslovakia has also
benefited from the fact that its foreign debt position is the most
advantageous among all East European countries save Romania.

POLAND

WARSAW will press the IMF for new concessions in its new pact with
the multilateral to ease the country's worsening financial straits.  The
government is watching helplessly as revenues from state-owned
enterprises dwindle, and the fledgling private sector can scarcely be
expected to fill the gaping hole in the budget.  The fiscal deficit is
projected to reach US$777 million this year, with inflation expected to
hit 55%.  Goals agreed with the IMF when the US$2.5 billion three-year
assistance package was originally negotiated in April already appear
hopelessly beyond reach.  One sign of Warsaw's growing desperation is
the postponement of a US$100 million payment on interest arrears owed
to commercial bank creditors.

Poland's financial reputation will be further tarnished by the brewing
scandal at the Agency for Foreign Debt Servicing.  The agency was
established before Solidarity took power, but several of its officials,
including Vice Finance Minister Janusz Sawicki, hold important positions
in the Bielecki government.  The agency is accused of mishandling the
funds, unauthorized repurchase transactions of national debt and outright
fraud.

The IMF will not agree readily to take the pressure off Warsaw -- but
some compromise appears inevitable if credit lines to Poland are to be
preserved.  Local political observers are loath to predict when the
population's tolerance for further austerity measures will run out, but the
pessimists say the breaking point is dangerously close.

BRAZIL

MONTHLY INFLATION moved as anticipated into double digits in
June, but the rise was not so drastic as to fatally undercut confidence in
Economy Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira's economic program.
Estimates by the FIPE institute at the University of Sao Paulo show
inflation for the 30-day period to July 8 accelerated to 10.7%, and FIPE
economists expect inflation to peak around 11% before easing to 10% by
end-July.

The IMF technical mission that arrived in Brazil this week will have to
weigh the recent economic progress made under Moreira against
lingering concerns, specifically over the inflation outlook and a
deterioration in the fiscal situation after steady improvement in 1990.
The latter problem reflects a sharp reduction in government revenues,
caused by restoration of diverse fiscal incentives by Congress and an
unexpected plunge in income tax receipts laid to bureaucratic confusion
under the previous economic team.  Restored tax breaks alone have cost
the federal treasury an estimated US$1.77 billion, boosting total
giveaways through fiscal incentives to a crushing US$7.82 billion -- or
1.51% of GDP.  Bureaucratic foulups in income tax collection over the
past year have cost the treasury another US$1 billion.

Despite these fiscal problems, Moreira stands a good chance of
persuading the Fund to sign off on a new credit facility so long as he can
offer convincing evidence that the economic situation has been stabilized
and inflation has been brought under control.  In this context, the July
inflation figures assume added weight as an indicator of the credibility
and effectiveness of Moreira's economic policy management.  His clout
with US and IMF officials in Washington should also help -- but no
amount of influence could overcome a renewed deterioration in the
inflation trend.  To bolster anti-inflation policy, Moreira has concentrated
his formidable diplomatic skills on persuading Congress of the need to
resist pressure for a return to full-fledged wage indexation.  His success
in maintaining wage restraint thus far should improve Brazil's case with
the IMF.  Moreira also can be expected to emphasize the fiscal windfall
anticipated from the dramatic shortening of the term for industrial tax
collections under EM 297.

Assuming July inflation holds below 11%, Moreira is well positioned to
gain IMF approval of a new letter of intent, clearing the way for signoff
on a credit facility.  Moreira's immediate objective is to gain IMF
commitment to an 18-month standby loan, which currently is expected
to total between US$1.5-2 billion.  If Brazil remains on course in
meeting its IMF targets, the economy minister is expected to seek
subsequent Fund approval of an extended fund facility for a three-year
term, with a credit commitment totaling US$3 billion or more.  If the
IMF hurdle can be cleared, Moreira remains optimistic that a deal with
commercial bank creditors can be reached by yearend.  The bank talks
can be expected to proceed in parallel with renegotiation of Paris Club
debt, currently estimated at around US$4 billion.

Terms for securitization of exports were regulated by the Central Bank
this week in Carta Circular 2185, which will allow Brazilian exporters
to negotiate loans in foreign currency with an international financial
institution using export revenues as collateral.  Sources in Brasilia report
that Brazilian exporters already have filed requests at the Central Bank
totaling a massive US$1.5 billion for approval of securitization
operations.  The new mechanism for export financing already appears to
be supplanting traditional reliance on short-term credit lines from foreign
banks.  According to exporters, securitization is advantageous since it
allows for longer terms, lower interest rates and larger volumes of cash
in foreign currency rather than cruzeiros.  The CB regulation allows
Brazilian exporters to open foreign bank accounts where they can deposit
part of their revenues.
The National Monetary Council this week also approved the rules for
conversion of foreign debt for financing environmental projects.  A
conversion fund will be constituted by conversion of debt into Treasury
papers denominated in cruzeiros with FX correction and fixed interest of
6% yearly.  Brazilian debt would be acquired abroad at prevailing
secondary market discounts and exchanged for Treasury papers.  CB
President Francisco Gros said that the G7 commitment at the London
summit to initial investment in Amazon conservation will be discussed
within the rules approved this week.  In a first stage, the government has
set a ceiling of US$100 million on this type of conversion, but Gros
already concedes that this limit may well be increased.

A consortium of eight foreign private bank creditors headed by Austria's
BBA Creditanstalt-Bankverein plans to participate in the Brazilian
privatization process through debt-equity conversions.  This marks the
first time that a group of creditor banks has joined for this purpose. The
other banks in the consortium are Amro of Holland, Banco Portugues do
Atlantico of Portugal, Generale Bank of Belgium, Dresdner and BFG of
Germany, and UBS and SBC of Switzerland.  A leading figure in putting
together the consortium is former CB President Fernao Bracher,
president of BBA Creditanstalt in Brazil.

After moving up at the beginning of the week, interest rates began to
slide on July 17.  The traditional pattern of government expenditures
above receipts in the second half of the month is one factor; another is
the conclusion of reschedulings for most state banks with outstanding
debt obligations to the Central Bank.  Interbank CD rates dropped at
midweek from 17.5% monthly to 15.3%; private bank CDs were offered
for yearly rates of 325/340%, trending lower.  The official CB reference
rate, or TRD, for July has been set slightly higher at 10.05%, broadly
consistent with inflation estimates for the month.

The black dollar moved at midweek to Cr$364/366, at a 10.9% premium
over the commercial rate at Cr$329/330.  Gold prices edged up to
Cr$4,307, for a 10.8% advance over the past month.  After rallying
early in the week, the BOVESPA dropped 0.4% on July 17 to 14,164
points with a trading volume of Cr$9.48 billion; the BVRJ rose 0.9% to
57,683 points with trading volume at Cr$2.58 billion.  Telebras, the
telecoms parastatal, accounted for close to half of July 17 trading on
BOVESPA on expectations of spectacular first half profits exceeding
US$500 million.

BANK CONSOLIDATION, BRAZIL-STYLE

Brazilian bank earnings reports for the first five months of the year show
an industry that has grown in numbers -- and deteriorated in profitability.
The number of banks in Brazil has reached 239, and 116 -- nearly half
--  reported losses for the January-May period.

In good part, this negative performance reflects the fallout from an
excessive expansion of the industry in 1990, spurred by a flurry of
incorporations of small and medium-size institutions.  Liberalization of
rules for bank incorporation under the 1988 constitution and subsequent
regulations issued by the Sarney administration set the stage for last
year's expansion.  The result was a surge in institutions from 153 in
1989 to the present 239.

The irony is that the expansion occurred even as the draconian freeze of
investment funds implemented under the original Collor Plan in March
1990 drained liquidity from the system.  Total liquidity in the banking
system shrunk by nearly 50%, from US$116.5 billion in 1989 to US$59
billion in 1990.  Many of the new banks were not well prepared to face
the adversities of 1990.  Most were founded by industrial and retail
groups, restructured brokerages and distributors seeking to profit from
lucrative margins of as much as 50% that prevailed in the last months of
the Sarney administration.  Then came the liquidity crunch, followed by
a wave of bankruptcies in the second half of 1990 and a continued
monetary squeeze that put additional pressure on industry profit margins.

Few of the new banks thus far have failed as a result of these financial
pressures.  But industry executives believe that many will eventually
have to seek mergers to avoid going under, which could reduce the total
number of banks by as much as 40% over the next year.

AIRCRAFTS FOR SALE

With the debut selloff of the state-owned steelmaker Usiminas set for
September, the Collor government is preparing to launch its second
privatization with sale of the jet-turbine maintenance firm Companhia
Eletromecanica.  Celma, with assets officially valued at US$84 million,
will be privatized in several stages.  An initial tender of up to 10% of
total Celma shares will be offered to employees; United Technology,
which currently owns a 13% shareholding in Celma, will be offered the
option to increase its stake up to the 40% maximum established for
foreign shareholders in the privatization process.  Remaining Celma
stock will go on the block for public offer on October 22.

One problem that has held back privatization of Celma is the fact that it
is the only domestic company qualified to service Brazilian Air Force
jets.  This issue was resolved through inclusion of a special clause in
privatization terms that guarantees such maintenance will be continued.

Though the Celma selloff is on a much smaller scale than the Usiminas
deal, its sale breaks a number of nationalistic taboos and paves the way
for a much more significant privatization: Brazil's biggest aircraft maker,
Embraer.  The recent surprise appointment of former Infrastructure
Minister Ozires Silva as president of Embraer -- the company he headed
from its founding until he assumed the Petrobras presidency in 1986 --
has been widely interpreted as a mission to get the parastatal ready for
privatization.

ARGENTINA

GOOD NEWS on the inflation front: The cost-of-living index should
ease this month to a range of 2.2-2.5%, from 3.1% in June.  Economy
Minister Cavallo has taken the initiative with a new decree issued this
week to end blanket wage indexation, a key element in the government's
anti-inflation strategy.

But don't expect organized labor to accept wage restraint meekly.
Steelworkers boss Lorenzo Miguel already has called a new 24-hour
general strike for July 24, in protest of plans by the state-owned steel
giant Somisa to lay off roughly one-third of its 13,000-strong workforce.
CGT Saul Ubaldini is challenging the government on another front -- he
is widely expected to enter the Buenos Aires gubernatorial contest as an
independent in September, and his anticipated vote share of up to 5%
would likely come at the expense of Peronist nominee Eduardo Duharde.
And the emerging alliance of Luis Barrionuevo, Ubaldini and Miguel --
the so-called "BUM" factor -- poses a major threat to government wage
policy.  Current expectations are that Cavallo will seek to hold wage
adjustments within a range of 5-8% and limit adjustments to no more
than a semi-annual basis, but the unions promise rough sailing ahead.

The Menem government is moving to wrap up final terms for agreement
with the Fund, bolstered by continued price stability.  The target date for
signing of the IMF standby accord now appears to be July 29, with a
first tranche of US$260 million expected to be disbursed in September
from a one-year facility totaling US$1.04 billion.

The political situation is growing increasingly complicated as the
Peronists move toward what could prove a devastating defeat in
September congressional and gubernatorial elections.  Radical leader and
former president Raul Alfonsin already is predicting a Peronist debacle
and demanding a "national unity" government at the federal level.  One
of the more extraordinary endorsements for a unity pact among the major
parties came from former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who
suggested to Foreign Ministere Guido di Tella that such a move would
bolster foreign investor confidence in Argentina.

President Menem appears unlikely to give ground until the election
results are in, though speculation is rife that he will implement a
reshuffle at Interior if the ruling party suffers serious setbacks.  Present
forecasts anticipate that the Peronists will lose a substantial number of
congressional seats and governorships, with the Radicals making modest
gains but provincial parties staging the largest advances.  The 120-seat
Peronist plurality on the 254-seat lower house looks certain to undergo
serious erosion, though the party could cling to its majority in the
Senate.

The federal government's confrontation with the provinces deepened with
the brash move by Radical Governor Massaccesi in Rio Negro to seize
(with local police assistance) funds held at a CB-related federal financial
institution in the region.  Massaccesi claimed that the seizure was
justified by his need to meet state payrolls and the federal government's
failure to provide the provinces adequate resources to meet basic
financial requirements.  The conspicuous lack of criticism from other
provincial leaders has left Economy Minister Cavallo isolated in his
efforts to force return of the seized funds, though the federal government
has tightened the squeeze by canceling clearing for the province for new
withdrawals.

NEW ZEALAND

CONSUMER PRICES rose just 0.1% in the second quarter, the least
since 1967, while annual inflation slowed sharply to 2.8%.  This places
New Zealand ahead of all major OECD countries, including Australia,
Germany, Japan, the US and UK -- its biggest trading partners.  The
obvious implication is that local goods will become increasingly
competitive in foreign markets, and confirms our belief that the longer-
term outlook for the economy is decidedly bullish.  The continued
depreciation of the kiwi dollar to under the key 57-cent level against the
greenback and toward 57 on the TWI carries little inflation risk, and
instead will support a durable expansion led by exports later this year.

Inflation fell in most categories, particularly in transportation, household
and food costs.  Significantly, existing house prices fell 0.6% in the
quarter, the first drop since 1977.  Adjustment for volatile energy prices,
tax-related changes and other one-off factors yields an underlying annual
inflation rate of 2.2%, down from 2.7% in the first quarter and 4% a
year ago.  Weak domestic demand, falling real wages and falling
inflation expectations are all favorable portents.  NZNB economists
forecast underlying price growth of 2.3% for all of 1991.

The reaction of the Reserve Bank to the CPI result, which was in line
with expectations, speaks volumes about the official commitment to price
stability.  Market participants had hoped for a signal that the RB would
now tolerate a positively sloped yield curve; on July 15, the gap between
90 days and five years was virtually flat, compared with minus 151 bp
one year ago.  Instead, the CB declared that the encouraging headline
inflation rate overstates the actual improvement, and supported this with
its housing adjusted price index, which rose 0.3% in June and 3.4%
year-on-year.  Clearly, the monetary authority is not contemplating a
significant shift in policy as a result of the second quarter CPI.  On the
contrary, the RB noted that wholesale interest rates and the exchange rate
have already largely discounted the improvement in inflation.  Finally,
it warned that modest credit easing awaits further evidence that price
pressures remain under control and confirmation in this month's budget
that the government's fiscal house will be put in order.

PHILIPPINES

ECONOMICS AND POLITICS have taken a turn for the worse.
Government statisticians report that the economy is at a virtual standstill,
after an imperceptible 0.2% expansion in the first quarter.  Inflation rose
to a five-year high of 19.0% annually in June, and unemployment hit a
six-year peak of 15.1% in April, which is certain to increase further as
the 600,000 layoffs linked to the Mount Pinatubo eruption flow through
to the official data.

The recent political developments are equally bearish.  The resignation
of Oscar Orbos, President Aquino's eminently capable and trusted
executive secretary, was apparently the result of a cabinet power play.
Orbos was principally responsible for implementing a local version of
glasnost and perestroika, which have made the administration more
accessible to the electorate and streamlined the bloated government
bureaucracy; his absence will be sorely felt.  At the same time, Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos vacated his portfolio to pursue the ruling party's
mandate in the May 1992 elections.  These departures will leave the
president without two of her most popular advisers, just as a social crisis
is emerging on the horizon.

Indeed, opposition members Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and VP Salvador
Laurel recently warned of impending chaos -- food riots staged by the
thousands left jobless, hungry and homeless by the fury of Pinatubo.
Although this strikes IR as deliberately alarmist and laden with ulterior
political motives, the deteriorating economy does have explosive
potential.  Both the rightist Iglesia Ni Kristo Church of Christ group and
the leftist Kilusang Mayo Uno May 1st movement are planning massive
rallies.  Their demands: rollback of petroleum prices to the level of
December 4, 1990, when Aquino pushed through sharp increases to
comply with IMF guidelines; and elimination of the 9% import surtax
implemented in January.

The INK's agenda could well extend beyond these two issues.  Loyal to
the late President Marcos, closely knit and thus politically influential, this
extremist sect is capable of putting all of its 4 million supporters on the
streets.  The apparent gambit: If the Catholic church was able to
organize one million for the historic people-power movement in February
1986 that led to Marcos's demise, the INK can do the same to Aquino.
To guard against infiltration by troublemakers, the sect has recruited
thousands of marshals backed by six helicopters.

In contrast, the KMU has a proven track record for provoking violence.
And IR does not dismiss the possibility that renegade Col. "Gringo"
Honasan and his Reform Armed Forces Movement might seek to take
advantage of the situation by mounting another coup attempt.  Two
hopeful notes: The conservative Federation of Free Farmers and the
Trade Union Congress of the Philippines will not join the INK and KMU
in the street demonstrations; and the unofficial ceasefire continues to hold
in the volcano-affected regions and insurgency-related incidents
elsewhere remain subdued.

Perhaps the worst news came from Washington, which disclosed that
Clark AFB will be abandoned after all because of the devastation
wrought by the volcano.  A Pentagon survey team estimated that it would
cost US$500-800 million to dig out the 9,000-acre base and repair
runways and more than 70 buildings that were damaged by ash.  Thus,
the Air Force will vacate Clark at the expiration of the existing lease on
September 16, 1992.  But the US considered Subic Naval Base with its
strategically important deep-water port worth the cost of rehabilitation.
In fact, the Pinatubo disaster put new urgency into the talks that have
dragged on for 14 months.  Chief negotiator Richard Armitage's
bargaining position was substantially enhanced by the dire economic
circumstances in the Philippines, and by the growing congressional
opposition to any continued military presence on the islands when the US
is shuttering dozens of installations at home.  The two sides reached
agreement this week on a new lease for Subic, which carries a 10-year
term and provides for US$400-500 million in cash and in-kind
compensation divided about equally.  This will provide the economy with
urgently needed relief, although the treaty will face stiff opposition in the
Philippine Senate, where approval by a two-thirds vote is required.

The poor political and economic fundamentals explain the collapse of the
Manila Composite to 990 points on July 12 from 1,554 two weeks ago.
Curiously, the peso regrouped from a brief slide to appreciate by 16
centavos to P27.59/US$ in official dealing and by 42 centavos to
US$27.55 in parallel activity -- unsustainable strength in both cases.

INDIA

ECONOMIC reforms have been coming from the new Congress
government of PM Narasimha Rao at such a furious pace that no one is
quite able to figure out their impact on the economy or on specific
industries.  Over the past three weeks, the government has:

* devalued the rupee by around 18% against a basket of currencies and
promised to make the rupee a convertible currency in three to five years'
time;

* overhauled the export policy regime;

* raised bank lending rates; and

* presented a railways budget that makes a determined effort to put
industry finances on a firm footing.

And the most dramatic moves are yet to come.  The government is
drafting a new industrial policy that promises to push deregulation well
beyond previous expectations, and its new budget is expected to narrow
the federal deficit, slash a range of subsidies and launch privatizations for
select public sector enterprises.

In IR's view, the significance of the rupee devaluation has been
exaggerated, and its benefits in the medium term remain unclear.  But
the government had no choice -- not so much because of IMF insistence
as a condition for new credit, but rather to shore up eroded confidence
among international bankers (which led to an almost complete
evaporation of short-term loans) and expatriate Indians (who made heavy
withdrawals from foreign currency deposits held in Indian banks).  At
the pace of deterioration on the eve of devaluation, the country's FX
reserves of R25 billion, equivalent to just two weeks' import cover,
would have run out in three days.  The initial steep devaluation of the
rupee was a dramatic gesture intended to send a message that the new
government was determined to restore economic and fiscal order and
serious about carrying out IMF-approved reforms.  The strategy appears
to have worked -- at least for now.  The run on overseas Indian deposits
has ceased, both because of renewed confidence in the government and
because a devalued rupee implies higher returns for expatriates in rupee
terms.

The long-term implications of rupee devaluation for the balance of
payments, however, are unclear.  The 1966 devaluation of the rupee
failed in the short run because of production constraints caused by
drought, though it did tend to narrow the trade gap over the longer term.
In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the steady decline of the rupee, while
leading to an acceleration of exports, failed to narrow the trade gap as
imports also grew rapidly.  Given that India's export mix remains
heavily weighted toward relatively price-inelastic commodities,
devaluation by itself will not have a major impact on the trade balance
in the near term -- but combined with the entire reform package
proposed, it could make a difference.  The real breakthrough so far has
been the new trade policy, which scraps the vexatious system of
government-issued import licenses with a streamlined system for license
issuance based on export performance (exporters will receive Exim scrips
valued at up to 30% of exports, which will be freely traded).  The
reform eliminates procedural delays and diminishes opportunities for
bureaucratic corruption; more important, it links imports to export
performance -- a definite incentive to manufacturers to step up export
capability.  Import-dependent industries (such as computers and
consumer electronics) will obviously be hit hard, while exporters of
goods with minimal import content (such as various agribusinesses) will
reap windfall profits by selling off Exim scrips they earn but do not
require.  The new trade policy also eliminates cash subsidies for
exporters (the devaluation of 18% should be adequate incentive for
competitive exporters, while uncompetitive exports will cease), saving
the government R40 billion per fiscal year -- a move that will go a long
way toward bridging this year's budget deficit.

Bank lending interest rates have been raised to a minimum of 18% from
the existing 17%, with banks free as before to fix rates over the
minimum.  A move to increase long-term interest rates was announced
earlier.  The moves are intended partly to rein in excess demand in the
economy, but also to answer persistent demands for pricing scarce capital
more realistically.

Rationalization is also the central theme behind railway rate reform, with
both freight and passenger fares hiked to yield a projected budget
surplus.  Market borrowings by the railways will be increased in
accordance with the principle that reliance on budgetary allocations must
diminish, which partly explains the move to reduce subsidies for
passenger travel.

US DOLLAR

The G7 went into the London economic summit with lofty expectations.
Depending on who was talking, these included a pledge to revitalize the
stalled Uruguay round of GATT, improve the coordination of economic
policy, provide debt relief for Third World countries, step up the war on
drugs and money-laundering, draft a plan for environmental protection,
and in general promote sustained economic recovery and price stability
for all.  The formal emphasis on economic issues notwithstanding, the
most important item on the agenda was clearly Mikhail Gorbachev.  In
short, the seven heads of state aimed to do nothing less than manufacture
perestroika on a global scale.

The flurry of communiques issued at the conclusion of the summit
declared substantial progress on all counts.  In fact though, the talks did
little more than confirm that the Seven are not prepared to abandon their
parochial interests for the collective good.  The US expansion is on
track, the economic slowdown in continental Europe and Japan will
continue, the collapsing economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union will collapse further -- despite the best efforts of the august group.
As expected, Bonn eloquently represented Moscow's case for buckets of
Western cash, which was vigorously resisted by Washington and Tokyo.
In the event, the opposing sides compromised and agreed to provide
plenty of moral support for the beleaguered Kremlin leader but no
bailout -- again, as expected.

None of this should have come as a surprise.  On the contrary, the
outcome was virtually preordained and reflects the nettlesome economic,
political and social problems that each of the Seven faces at home.
Japan's Toshiki Kaifu arrived in London somewhat humbled by the
brokerage scandal in Tokyo and revelations that Japanese firms illegally
supplied military hardware to Iraq.  But the others also came with
forgettable baggage, and almost no one could escape responsibility for
the embarrassing BCCI affair.

For the foreign exchanges, the significance is that the solid consensus
that led to the Plaza and Louvre accords no longer exists.  Thus, the
dollar will dance to the tune played in the markets, with little regard to
the preferences of the authorities.  From IR's perspective, the road for
the dollar is clearly up.  Readers are well acquainted with the reasons,
which in brief review focus on the favorable economic and political
fundamentals for the US, particularly when compared with Germany.

The recent statistics indicate further improvement at American factories
and reveal signs of life in the moribund housing market.  Even the
dismal auto industry appears to have rebounded modestly.  At the same
time, both wholesale and retail inflation remain under control (an
unsustainable jump in renter and homeowner costs was responsible for
the 0.4% rise in the core CPI for June).  Granted the rosy outlook
should not be exaggerated -- the unexpected 0.2% decline in retail sales
last month confirms that consumers are not prepared to embark on a
spending binge, and the decline in the personal savings rate to 3.6% in
May suggests that they may not be able to.  But there is no doubt that
the business cycle in the US is ahead of much of the industrialized
world.

Thus, IR is confident of the dollar's longer-term direction, even though
daily and weekly volatility will remain high.  This past week was no
exception.  After trading more quietly in early July, a riot broke out on
July 12, as a pair of weak US statistics combined with a sharp response
from the authorities to send the dollar plummeting from DM1.8410 to a
low of DM1.7850 in a matter of hours.  The repeated bouts of concerted
intervention -- by 15 central banks, including the Fed and Bundesbank
--  reflected truly masterful timing that forced the FX markets into a
defensive mode ahead of the London meeting.  Although no one will
admit as much, the Fed's participation was obviously part of a G7 pact:
The Bundesbank's Poehl agreed to delay tightening at the July 11 council
meeting in exchange for Alan Greenspan's support for a coordinated
attack.

IR's advice all along has been to take advantage of dips to buy cheaply
--  and the markets seem to have the same idea.  Indeed, the dollar was
consistently supported at key levels above DM1.78.  Even the latest
selloff on July 18 linked to the May merchandise trade report (both
exports and imports declined, a sign of weak demand at home and
abroad) failed to inflict the fatal blow.  The greenback was easily beaten
through the critical DM1.7770 area to a low above DM1.7650, but both
the corporates and the dealers stepped in to bid it up to safer levels.  In
our view, the dollar will continue to run on a treadmill until participants
see compelling reasons for a break into a new range.  Thus, we prefer
to believe that current prices are close to an effective bottom.

GERMAN MARK

A BOXING MATCH is in progress.  In one corner, the technicals are
pummeling the dollar lower.  On July 18, the unit broke through support
at DM1.7840 and the more important DM1.7770 level and tumbled an
additional 120 points before regaining its footing.  In the other corner,
the fundamentals have thrown the favorable US economic statistics into
the ring to defend their case for a higher dollar.  The technical analysis
is as follows: We have witnessed a correction after the (halting) rally
from DM1.6900 to DM1.8425.  On this current dollar downtrend, the
support levels are DM1.7850 (already vanquished) and DM1.7650
(dangerously close).  Beyond that lie DM1.7550 and DM1.7480.  As the
theory goes, a break of DM1.7650 heralds a collapse to DM1.6900.
This may look convincing on the charts, but we see little fundamental
justification for a significant dollar correction.  Indeed, the recent
appearance of corporate demand for dollars indicates skepticism among
longer-term participants with the bearish astrology.  In addition, while
the central banks have succeeded admirably in setting up the markets, we
doubt that their strategy is to sell the dollar down to DM1.70.  Thus, we
will operate in a DM1.7550-1.8150 range over the forecast horizon.

JAPANESE YEN

THE CONCERTED central bank defense of the DM on July 12 cost the
yen heavily on the cross, which climbed from Y75.50/DM ahead of the
intervention to test key resistance at Y76.90.  Since then, it has ranged
mostly between Y76.00-76.60 in trendless trading.  The yen broke out
of its narrow range against the dollar and soared 300 points to a high of
Y136.05 during that furious Friday morning.  But in the meantime it has
retreated to Y137.50, and thus we look for it to remain inside of
Y136-139 over the next two weeks.  IR's expectation that the
dollar/mark is near bottom implies that the DM/Y is approaching its top
-- a reversal of the scenario from last week.  Our success with the cross
extends the record to four straight weeks (which will more than pay for
stopping out of the short DM/SF position).  Most recently, readers
bought DM for half at Y75.85 and soon took profit at Y76.85.  Next
week, we suggest selling the cross for 50% at current levels around
Y77.20 with the expectation of again taking 100 points of profit.

We should point out however that there is considerable disagreement
about the outlook.  For example, we hear that Japanese commercial
banks plan to raise substantial amounts of subordinated loans from life
insurance companies.  To increase lending domestically, life insurers
may reduce overseas investment and perhaps even repatriate foreign
funds.  The effect will be to reduce the demand for dollars and other
currencies.  The markets also know that if the yen strengthens -- against
the dollar or EMS bloc -- the insurance companies may need to purchase
yen to hedge their foreign investments.

STERLING

THE MARKETS ignored the 50-bp cut in base rates engineered by the
Bank of England on July 12.  In fact, the pound actually firmed
marginally on the cross to a high of DM2.9631/STG, and currently
appears firm about one pfennig below.  Technicians now see good
support at DM2.95, compared with previous support at
DM2.9350-2.9400.  The markets are also bullish the pound against the
dollar.  One source close to the action saw a US brokerage purchase
STG200 million of US$1.7500 sterling calls on the IMM at midweek.
Nonetheless, IR remains skeptical of this currency and advises steering
clear of a continued rally.  The recent indicators on industrial output,
unemployment and unit labor costs depict continued recession and
resilient inflation pressures.  Readers are still fully short the cross at
DM2.9450 and should take profits at DM2.9180.  Look for a
US$1.6250-1.6850 range against the dollar, and be prepared for sterling
to be punished if major support 30 points under the bottom is broken.
On the yen cross, IR is still short the pound for 50% at Y226.00/STG,
and will sell for the balance at Y228.00.  We have raised the
recommended level to take profits to Y222.50.

SWISS FRANC

THIS CROSS came under additional pressure in the past week.  The
franc tested SF0.8700/DM after the Bundesbank announced that
monetary policy would not change, and has recovered only 30 points
since then.  A contributing factor was a July 17 report that the SNB will
link its currency to the ECU.  The markets interpreted this to mean that
the Swiss are abandoning their traditional ties to the restrictive policies
in Bonn -- a ridiculous assertion since this never was an expressed policy
of the SNB.  In any case, the prevailing dislike for the SF has forced us
to reconsider the near-term outlook.  IR now advises stopping out of
short DM acquired at SF0.8535 at a loss.  Immediately reverse to
purchase the cross for a half lot at current levels around SF0.8660 and
put on a quick stop-loss at SF0.8625.  Against the dollar, IR nailed the
actual range for the July 17 week -- SF1.5443-1.5942, 40 points above
prediction (although the dollar broke through the bottom during the July
18 selloff).  A test of SF1.52 is possible over the fortnight, while the
dollar should face resistance at SF1.57.

FRENCH FRANC

THE FUNDAMENTAL strength of this franc was confirmed by the June
CPI -- up 0.2% from the previous month and 3.3% from a year ago.
This brought the growth rate of French prices under the German rate
(3.5% at present) for the first time since 1973, and assures membership
in the elite group of low-inflation countries.  It also reflects the
commitment in Paris to building a strong currency through tough wage
bargaining and a refusal to follow a beggar-thy-neighbor policy of
devaluation.  Thus, IR's longer-term confidence in the FF is intact.  But
in the immediate future we cannot rule out a rise in the cross over
FF3.40/DM, in view of the softer tone in franc deposit rates linked to
recent remarks from FM Beregovoy that hint at a 25-bp cut in the CB's
intervention rate.  Consequently, we are more comfortable to square up
short DM at current levels around FF3.3930 for a modest profit of 10
points.  Over the forecast horizon, readers should sell the cross for 50%
at FF3.3975, and short for the balance at FF3.4050.  Against the dollar,
buy francs at FF6.16 and sell at FF5.95.

CANADIAN DOLLAR

THE RECESSION may be over, but IR remains skeptical and has a
receptive audience among Canadian business executives.  Indeed, many
are now raising the possibility of a double-dip recession that is also
mentioned south of the border.  At the very least, the economic recovery
will proceed from a deep hole, with little assistance from fiscal or
monetary policy.  Readers are familiar with our aversion to the high-
yielding currencies.  The Canadian dollar is a particular favorite as a
parking place for speculative Japanese capital, which has little allegiance.
Indeed, further revelations about what is billed as "Canada's Watergate"
triggered overnight selling on July 18 by three major Tokyo banks and
sent the Can$ tumbling by nearly 100 points to Can$1.1565.  Those who
have patiently held greenbacks purchased at Can$1.1470 took 70 points
of profit on the move.  IR recommends employing a similar strategy at
slightly higher levels in the weeks ahead: Buy US for half of positions
on a dip to Can$1.15 with a view to taking a full cent of profit.

AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR

THE JUNE employment report revealed a modest but unexpected drop
in the jobless rate to 9.3%, and a more moderate rate of decline in full-
time payrolls.  Canberra says -- we agree -- that Australia is slowly
emerging from an unusually deep recession, and surveys of business
expectations point to the same conclusion.  However, we are less
optimistic about the pace and strength of the recovery.  The labor market
in particular will remain weak for the foreseeable future, and a further
rise in the unemployment rate toward 10% is not out of the question.  In
fact, the Treasury forecasts a peak rate of 10.75%.  That seems unduly
pessimistic, but may help to explain the prevailing expectation for an
additional 50-bp reduction in official cash rates to 10% next month.  The
market is tipping at a credit easing to accompany the second quarter
reports on consumer prices on August 7 or the national accounts on
August 15.  This could cut short the Aussie dollar's stubborn rally to a
high of US$0.7767 this week.  In fact, the unit slid 40 points on July 17
amid rumors (quickly denied) that the RBA had sold the A$ around
US$0.7750.  True or not, the reaction indicates that dealers have little
confidence in holding long Aussie positions.  IR expects to take 100
points of profit on short A$ acquired at US$0.7600, but now advises
laying a stop at US$0.7810 to protect against an unlikely bounce.

OVERVIEW

CONVERGENCE WAS THE KEY to profits in European bond markets
as this year began, and until recently inflation and interest rates appeared
to be trending toward Germany's more desirable levels.  FX risk aside,
this partly explains why, in the first half of 1991, Spanish bonds
outperformed all other major government instruments with a local-
currency total return of 13.9%.  But now that the drop in inflation has
stalled in Spain and Italy -- the other high-yielder -- high nominal returns
no longer suffice.  Meanwhile, inflation in Germany has crept up to
3.5% and looks headed over 4%, pulling up the anchor of European
convergence.  With German bond yields on the rise and the Bundesbank
expected to hike its central rates when its leadership returns from
holiday, some observers see pressure on yields in other major
government securities markets.

A case in point is France, where inflation, now at an annual 3.3% rate,
is below Germany's for the first time since 1973.  Finance Minister
Pierre Beregovoy makes no bones about wanting to cut interest rates,
much to the dismay of analysts who point to a vulnerable exchange rate
and inevitable German tightening.  Yet the French market, bolstered by
an influx of capital fleeing Bunds, has shown some willingness to bring
down yields.  The lesson from this is that convergence, which took its
compass bearings from Germany, is off for the moment, although it
might be going too far to say divergence is now the rule.  Still, in
months to come, markets with sound fundamentals will pave their own
road while Germany struggles down the reunification path.  German rates
are pushing to attractive levels, but unfurling risk in Frankfurt makes the
50-bp premium offered by French OATs even more attractive and gives
Beregovoy leeway to push down rates regardless of the BB's intentions.

UNITED STATES

TREASURIES saw both extremes over the past week.  Investors were
alternately encouraged by retreating producer prices and weak retail
sales, and discouraged by unexpectedly high June consumer inflation and
housing starts.  The latter figures carried more weight.  The 5.2% gain
in housing starts built the case for a durable -- if not necessarily dynamic
-- recovery, while the rise in consumer prices disappointed bulls who
pointed to the textbook tendency of inflation to slow in the wake of a
recession.  However, economists are learning that the 1990-91 recession
is following an unpublished textbook, much to the chagrin of participants
who loaded up on long maturities.  Other factors contributed to the
uncertain bond outlook.  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan launched his
twice-yearly testimony to Congress on the economy.  His message was
mixed in its implications for the Treasuries market: Despite compelling
signs of recovery, the central bank looks for meaningful progress on
inflation.  But that was before the July 17 release of consumer prices --
up just 0.2% overall, but with core (excluding energy and food) prices
up 0.4%.  Bond investors took that as an indication that inflationary
pressures have not been purged by the recession and continue to threaten
real returns.  That, taken with the housing starts data, sparked selling
and markdowns to push the key 30-year bond yield to 8.49% on July 17,
from 8.43% on July 12 after the PPI release.

A rise in applications for jobless benefits on July 18 did not appear to
break the recent trend of improvement in the labor market, and thus was
of little help.  During the July 18 session the long bond yield improved
slightly to 8.47%, but the upward bias remains.  With the June inflation
figures behind it, the market has begun to focus on issues of supply.  In
the week ahead participants face the sale of US$12.5 billion in two-year
notes and US$9.25 billion in five-year notes.  But of greater concern is
the August quarterly refunding operation, which has been estimated at
US$37.5 billion, another record.  Specific figures on the refunding are
to be released July 31 -- which could accelerate sales and markdowns to
push the key yield toward the 8.60% level.  Over the shorter term,
however, the market could well manage to hold within the range pivoting
around 8.50% on grounds that the jury is still out about the strength of
the recovery.  It may also reconsider the CPI data, which suffered from
some one-off influences.  There has been some idle talk of another Fed
easing, but this seems improbable in view of the encouraging indicators
and the bond market's resilient inflation jitters.  "Watchful waiting," in
Greenspan's artful phrasing, speaks volumes, which makes intermediate
maturities -- twos to fives -- the place to be.

JAPAN

TOKYO BOND ACTIVITY was not reinvigorated by the return of the
Big Four securities houses to full trading after their slap-on-the-wrist,
four-day suspension for unethical dealings.  Indeed, IR wonders if there
is anything capable of shaking the Japanese government bond market out
of its torpor.  The recent half-point cut in the official discount rate has
been absorbed without significant benefit to bonds.  It would not surprise
us if the Bank of Japan were to give the markets another 50-bp cut in the
discount rate by the end of this quarter (sooner if the Nikkei plunges
below 22,000).  But that cannot be counted upon and the market may be
obliged to bide its time and await further indications of a decelerating
economy, better price data and restoration of a positive yield curve.  In
the meantime, bonds may do worse before they do better.

We have seen reports that Japanese banks, under pressure to defend their
capital ratios eroded by the Nikkei's recent declines, intend to sell off as
much as 30% of their bond holdings this year and next.  But a fall in
money market rates could bolster the Nikkei and convince Japanese life
insurers to shift from cash and short-term instruments into bonds, in
expectation of a rally later this year assisted by a relatively strong yen.
But until the CB moves to cut the ODR from its present 5.5% level,
there will be little interest for participants to increase exposure in
Japanese bonds.  The money market reveals no expectation of an
imminent cut, with the key unsecured overnight call rate trading around
7.50% and the three-month CD changing hands at 7.60-7.65%.  Those
rates still figure very favorably with the benchmark 10-year government
bond yield, which on July 18 stood at 6.74% after 6.78% a week earlier.
IR expects little progress in the week ahead.

GERMANY

ALTHOUGH the London economic summit lightened the burden on
Bunds of a Soviet economic debacle, the investment climate in Germany
itself continued to deteriorate.  While Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Finance Minister Theo Waigel were urging the rescue of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika program, their opposition at home was
on the offensive.  An SPD leader scoffed at Waigel's estimate of a
DM140 billion public sector deficit this year, claiming it would amount
to some DM202.1 billion; Rudi Walther, head of the Bundestag's budget
committee, said rising deficits were having devastating financial effects.
Later the FM acknowledged a rise to DM156 billion, after which
Deutsche Bank chief economist Norbert Walter forecast what the markets
already know: The Bundesbank will have to raise interest rates later this
year.  Despite this, the bond market held its own during the issuance of
DM2.39 billion one- and two-year zero-coupon notes.  They went down
at average yields of 9.20% (with a tail to 9.28%) and 9.18%,
respectively.  The benchmark 10-year federal bond closed on July 17 at
a yield of 8.59%, continuing a steady advance in the week.

Market sentiment took a turn for the worse the next day, ironically just
as the DM continued its rally against the dollar, on the basis of the July
monthly report of the Bundesbank and the US trade report.  The CB said
the price climate was worsening considerably even before the tax hike
was implemented this month.  Private economists see the cost of living
surging to 4.2-4.3% in July compared with 3.5% in June, and the central
bank's policy-making council is not expected to respond by raising rates
before August 15.  While this inflationary surge was expected, the
revised PSBR projection has conjured up images of a tidal wave of new
supply, further depressing prices and driving up yields.  On July 18 the
key 8 3/8% 10-year government bond yielded 8.66% as the futures
contract crashed through support levels; market operators are looking for
buying interest only at 8.75%.  In the current climate, IR expects Bunds
to quickly reach that target -- at which investors may wish to begin
cautiously acquiring government paper.

UNITED KINGDOM

AS IR EXPECTED, the Bank of England cut the base lending rate by 50
bp to 11% on July 12, even though the RPI figures released by the CSO
were above forecast.  Retail inflation remained at a 12-month rate of
5.8% in June, the same as in May, due mainly to seasonal rises in food
prices.  Excluding mortgage payments, the rate rose to 6.9% from 6.6%.
Gilt investors decided things were as good as they would be for a while
and began to lighten up, with many shifting funds to the French
government bond market.  But there was more erosion at the front end
than in long maturities, given the strong fundamentals at the far end.
Supply concerns are an additional factor.  On July 12 the BoE said it will
issue STG500 million in paper in tranches of 12% and 9.5% stock due
1998 and 2005, respectively.  Though well received, that contributed to
the market's more tenuous tone.

However, it's premature to say that the gilts rally is over.  Exchequer
Norman Lamont said at the summit that while he looks for a second half
recovery, it has not yet begun.  On July 18 the market received a battery
of economic data that was relatively bullish for bonds.  Unemployment
rose to 8.1% in June from 7.9% in May and industrial production fell
by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in May after a 2.7% fall in April.  While
the figures cast doubt on predictions of a double-dip recession, they do
indicate that the first dip is not over.  Thus, gilts will probably progress
further.  On July 18 the benchmark 10% gilt maturing in February 2001
yielded 10.27%, compared with 10.20% after the rate cut on July 12 and
10.26% a week earlier.  The longer-dated 11 3/4% of 2003 yielded
10.22% against 10.27% a week before,   and the 12% coupon of 2017
yielded 9.97% after  10.02%.  IR sees continued declines in yields in the
weeks ahead, although progress on the short end will depend on
expectations for additional credit easing.  But with elections apparently
delayed until 1992 and inflation now stalled, the next cut is unlikely to
come until late in the summer.

OTHER MARKETS

French bonds were well bid this week on June's 3.3% inflation rate.
There was some disappointment on July 16, when the Bank of France
left its intervention rate at 9% in a tender operation, which may be
linked to official concern that the franc might suffer.  But a 25-bp cut --
the same as the last, in March -- is being discounted with inflation seen
at 2.8% by yearend.  Still, foreign investors remain wary of the policies
of Socialist PM Edith Cresson.  Securities prices rose in the week as
Beregovoy said low inflation would boost the franc and allow rate cuts.
Yields fell 12-14 bp at an auction of two- and five-year notes on July 17,
but the next day players balked at a large FF11 billion note tender.
However, support levels held and prices looked firm.  The benchmark
9.5% 10-year bond finished at 9.14%, up three bp from one week
before.  Progress is likely to be tied closely to the franc's position in the
EMS grid.  Elsewhere, Spanish yields pushed up on July 18 after
government-union talks on a proposed wage and productivity pact broke
down.  The yield at a tender of one-year bills rose to 12.04% from
11.73% at the last such tender.  Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga
warned of tighter fiscal policy and higher interest rates in answer to
inflation, which is stubbornly holding around 6%.  Failure of the wage
and productivity negotiations squelch talk that the Bank of Spain might
ease its 12.75% intervention rate.

BNI president upbeat about share offering

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): The president of state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia
(BNI) 1946, Widigdo Sukarman, said yesterday he was confident the bank's
initial public offering (IPO) in November would be well received by
investors despite the large number of shares it had to sell.
   Widigdo said the bank, which started a "roadshow" promotion campaign
here yesterday, would take the IPO roadshow to six other cities in
Indonesia and to major financial centers in Japan, Europe and the United
States to attract investors.
   "We are confident that foreign and domestic investors will respond
positively. The potential demand for BNI shares is quite good," he told
reporters after launching the bank's roadshow program, which is to end
on Oct. 24.
   He said the bank, the country's largest commercial bank, would sell
1.08 billion new shares, or around 25 percent of its enlarged capital.
   The share prices, each with a face value of Rp 500 (20 U.S. cents),
are to be determined at the end of the roadshow. The shares are to be
sold to the public during the primary offering period between Nov. 6 and
Nov. 29.
   Widigdo hinted that the price of the bank's shares would be set at a
reasonable level even though the potential demand for the shares was
promising.
   "The bank's IPO is merely based on business factors so that we will
make a success not only on the primary market but also on the secondary
market," he said in an indirect reference to the decline of a number of
listed companies' share prices to below their IPO prices.
   He said the proceeds from the IPO would be used to boost its capital
and strengthen its short-term and long-term finance.

Assets

   BNI's total assets were valued at Rp 32.35 trillion ($13.7 billion)
on June 30 this year, with deposits amounting to Rp 17.90 trillion and
loans to Rp 20.44 trillion.
   Its pretax profit totaled Rp 198.6 billion in the first semester of
this year, or more than half of last year's pretax profit of Rp 378.7
billion.
   David Chang, the research division director of securities company PT
Vickers Ballas Tamara, said the bank, which had the widest national
network, with over 489 branches throughout the country and six overseas
branches, was projected to sell its shares at a price which offered a
price earning ratio between eight and 10 times of its 1997 profit. On
the Jakarta Stock Exchange, the banking sector's price earning ratio is
generally eight times its 1997 profits.
   "If the bank offered (the shares) at a discount, the issue is likely
to be successful because it deserves a premium over the banking sector,
given its sovereignty," he told The Jakarta Post.
   The bank is expected to raise around Rp 1 trillion from the IPO,
allowing it to strengthen its capital and improve its capital adequacy
ratio from its current level of 9.1 percent to about 12 percent, he
said.
   Chang said the bank, which is expected to maintain its loan to
deposit ratio at around 85 percent to 90 percent, would generate
sufficient funds from the IPO to support its growth over the next three
to four years.
   He projected that BNI would maintain its credit expansion rate at
about 17 percent a year for the next few years in conformity with the
central bank's low loan expansion target.
   BNI's net interest margin is likely to remain at 3.5 percent in 1997
as it compensates for the rise in its reserve requirement from 3 percent
to 5 percent next April, he said.
   On funding, Chang said the bank had an advantage over its competitors
in strengthening its retail market, given its large branch network and
its low sovereign risk. (hen)

Sukarno's daughters make peace with army officer

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): A lawsuit for libel which was filed by two of former
president Sukarno's daughters against Armed Forces' Chief of
Sociopolitical Affairs Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid was settled by mediation
in court yesterday.
   The conflicting parties agreed to end the row after Syarwan
"corrected" a contentious statement that he reportedly made on Megawati
Soekarnoputri, the deposed chairperson of the Indonesian Democratic
Party (PDI), and Sukmawati Soekarnoputri last August.
   The agreement was mediated by Judge Thoyib at the East Jakarta
District Court.
   Megawati and Sukmawati filed the lawsuit, saying they were offended
by Syarwan's statement, published by Surya daily newspaper, which
accused Megawati of planning to start a rebellion along the lines of
Cory Aquino's "people's power" in the Philippines.
   In the Surya article, Syarwan was reported as saying that Sukmawati
was mobilizing her Marhaen group, a pronationalist organization of
followers of Sukarno's teachings, to help the rebellion.
   Syarwan's remarks were reportedly made during a meeting with members
of the Indonesian Ulema Council in Jakarta on Aug. 12. Surya's front
page article the following day carried the suggestive heading "Megawati
wants to become Cory Aquino: ABRI Chief of Sociopolitical Affairs".
   Megawati and Sukmawati said the remarks were slanderous and damaging
to the reputation of their father and people in general. They demanded a
public apology and Rp 50 billion in damages.
   Only Sukmawati was present in court yesterday. Syarwan and Megawati
were represented by their lawyers.
   Syarwan's lawyers Col. Imron Anwari and Major Payaman Pangaribuan
told the court that the statements regarding the two plaintiffs, printed
in Surya, "were untrue".
   This correction was deemed sufficient by the plaintiffs who
considered the case to be over, Antara reported.
   R.O. Tambunan, who represented Megawati at the hearing, told The
Jakarta Post last night that his client was not insisting on a public
apology.
   "The hearing today was open to the public and it was widely covered
by local and international press," Tambunan said, adding that the
decision "reflected Megawati's big heart".
   The case for Rp 50 billion in damages was automatically dropped.
   "We weren't after the money when we filed the lawsuit. We only wanted
to see the names of Megawati and Sukmawati restored," he said.
   He said the peace agreement resulted from a meeting of the parties'
lawyers on Sept. 17.
   "We did not drop the lawsuit. We came to an agreement," he stressed.
   Tambunan said that another lawsuit, filed by Megawati against the
Armed Forces Chief, the National Police Chief, the Minister of Home
Affairs and her foes in the PDI, would proceed.
   In this lawsuit, Megawati is demanding that the results of the
congress of her PDI foes in Medan in June be annulled. The congress,
which had the backing of the government and the military, deposed her as
the party's leader.
   This lawsuit is scheduled for this Thursday at the Central Jakarta
District Court. Efforts for an out of court settlement have failed.
   Syarwan's remarks in August came in the wake of massive riots in
Jakarta in which at least four people died.
   The July 27 riots, blamed on the leftist Democratic People's Party,
began after the violent takeover of the PDI headquarters by supporters
of Soerjadi, who ousted Megawati as the party's leader. (emb/imn)

ABRI reshuffles another hundred senior officers

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): The Armed Forces (ABRI) announced yesterday a reshuffle
affecting more than 100 senior officers in all four services, including
the reassignment of onetime rising star Maj. Gen. A.M. Hendropriyono.
   ABRI Chief Spokesman Brig. Gen. Amir Syarifudin told Antara that
Hendro would be recalled to ABRI headquarters, pending a new assignment
in a civilian position.
   Amir did not elaborate, but Suara Pembaruan daily reported yesterday
that Hendro, currently chief of the Army Training School in Bandung,
will be given the post of secretary for development operations, a
strategic position under the supervision of the State Secretariat.
   Some military analysts said the new civilian post would end his
military career. Hendro is currently 51 years old; the mandatory
retirement age for military officers is 55 years.
   A 1967 graduate of the Military Academy, Hendro was once regarded as
one of the Army's most promising rising stars when he became the
youngest ever chief of a regional military command. He became chief of
the Jakarta Regional Military Command at the age of 48 in 1993.

Latest reshuffle

   Amir said the latest reshuffle in the military affects 108 senior
officers. As stipulated in a Sept. 16 decree by ABRI Chief Gen. Feisal
Tanjung, 52 Army officers, 24 Navy officers, 13 Air Force officers, and
19 officers of the National Police are being moved.
   Another major important change, announced Saturday, was the
replacement of the current assistant to the chief of sociopolitical
affairs, Maj. Gen. Suwarno Adiwijoyo, who is nearing the mandatory
retirement age of 55.
   He will be replaced by his deputy, Brig. Gen. Budi Harsono, who will
become the new assistant to Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid. Suwarno will be
recalled to the armed forces headquarters before he retires.
   The commandant of the Bandung-based Infantry Weapons Center, Maj.
Gen. Rachmad Mokoginta, is also being moved as he too is preparing for
his retirement. He will be replaced by his deputy Brig. Gen. Luhut
Panjaitan.
   Changes in the Navy include the reassignment of  Maj. Gen. (Marine)
Gafur Chalik, currently aide to the ABRI chief, to the Navy headquarters
to prepare for his retirement.
   Commodore Freddy Numberi, currently aide to the navy Chief of Staff,
will be assigned as Chief of the Fifth Sea Born Command based in Irian
Jaya, and Brig. Gen. (Marine) Benyamin Balukh, will be assigned as
deputy chief of the Armed Forces School of Command.
   In the Air Force, Rear Marshall Sadeli Kalman, chief of the Air
Force's Maintenance Division will be replaced by Commodore Syaiful
Kartimunaf.
   In the National Police, Brig. Gen. Soerpadi will be assigned as the
new director for operational education at the National Resilience
Institute, replacing Brig. Gen. I Wayan Karya. (imn)

Minister confirms art theft

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): The government confirmed yesterday the theft of a
number of valuable Indonesian paintings from the National Museum,
including two masterpieces withdrawn Friday by international auction
house Christie's from its October sale in Singapore.
   The theft took place a month ago and was believed to involve members
of staff at the museum, according to Minister of Education and Culture
Wardiman Djojonegoro.
   He said: "The stolen paintings have been withdrawn by Christie's from
its auction house."
   It was the first official statement issued by the government since
the news of the theft, categorized as part of the national collection,
was broken by some local media late last week.
   Wardiman gave no details about the other titles or the precise number
of paintings stolen from the museum, which is under the supervision of
the minister's office.
   According to reliable sources, at least six paintings by world-
renowned Indonesian masters, such as Raden Sarief Bustaman Saleh,
better-known as Raden Saleh, Affandi and Raden Basoeki Abdullah have
been taken.
   Police records show that the theft was only reported by museum
staffer Kolam Sardjono on Sept. 12.
   However, the theft was hidden from the public by the museum until art
curators were amazed to see Christie's catalog for the Oct. 6 auction
feature two paintings by Indonesian masters previously thought to be in
the National Museum here.
   Local media first reported the theft Friday, despite no official
comment from the authorities.
   Shortly after a long meeting the same day, Christie's International
Singapore Pte. Ltd. announced that the two paintings, A Nude, completed
in 1992, by Basoeki Abdullah and Portrait of a Dutch Governor Wearing
the Willems Order, completed in 1867, by Raden Saleh, were withdrawn
from its upcoming auction.
   However, there is no further explanation about the hasty withdrawal
or the current whereabouts of the paintings.
   Minister Wardiman criticized the media for disturbing the
investigation to arrest the thieves.
   "The reports have made the investigation more difficult. That's why I
asked the press not to magnify the case," he said.
   The minister said that any dishonest museum employees might have had
a double motivation; the poor security system and their low pay.
   "The museum employees are state employees. Therefore, they have the
same level of salary earned by other state employees," said Wardiman.
   Consequently the temptation to steal the precious items could have
become stronger, he said.
   The salary of middle-rank state employees ranges from Rp 250,000 to
Rp 500,000 (US$106 to $212) per month. The price of the each painting is
hundreds of millions of rupiah.
   The National Museum, located on Jl. Medan Merdeka Barat in Central
Jakarta, has recorded a number of thefts of a wide range of national
treasure from its collection.
   National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Dibyo Widodo said Sunday in Batam
Island, Riau, that the police have questioned a number of people
regarding the recent theft of the paintings.
   The three-star general also said that the Indonesian police have
asked the local police in Singapore, through Interpol, to help
investigate the stolen paintings.
   In another related development yesterday, Minister of Tourism, Post
and Telecommunication Joop Ave called on Christie's to cooperate with
Indonesia to arrest the suspects. (bsr/icn)

IKIP Surabaya selects new rector

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SURABAYA: The state Teachers Training Institute (IKIP) in Surabaya,
is having trouble selecting a new rector to replace Soerono
Martorahardjo.
   The three best of ten nominees for the position are said to have
flaws. Although two of them have doctorate degrees, one is said to have
been involved in corruption involving a campus development project three
years ago and one has been the target of student protests over the
expulsion of a lecturer.
   The other candidate has good leadership and academic ability but only
has an undergraduate degree (S1), said lecturers at the institute
yesterday.
   Academics at the institute doubt that he would be respected
professionally, because of his lack of experience and scientific
background.
   Suripan Sadi Hutomo, one of the three best candidates, said that the
nominees were selected on Sept. 17.
   "But the results have not been announced yet. Not even internally,"
he said.
   The institute is preparing to become a university in about three
years, when is expected to have the biggest campus in Southeast Asia.

238 arrested for timber theft

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SURABAYA: A forest raid, code-named "Brush Operation", has resulted
in the arrest of 238 people in Jombang and Nganjuk who are suspected of
stealing 600 cubic meters of teakwood from surrounding forests.
   "We expect that court hearings will be held soon to try all the
suspects, some of which are members of the Armed Forces (ABRI),"
Marsanto, a provincial government official in charge of security,
agrarian and public affairs, said yesterday.
   According to Antara, the market price of illegal timber ranges
between Rp 200,000 (US$85) and Rp 300,000 a meter cubic.
   He said 850 mobile brigade officers took part in the raid in areas
prone to illegal teak wood logging, including Nganjuk, Jombang and
Madiun.
   Marsanto said the operation would be extended to cover other areas in
East Java such as Bojonegoro and Padangan.
   "More preventive measures will be taken to deter teakwood theft," he
said.
   Nganjuk regent Soetrisno said that while he supported the efforts to
eliminate teakwood theft, he criticized a recent police move to
confiscate a local official's chair which they suspected of being made
from stolen wood. (14)

Reporters demand proper probe

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SURAKARTA, Central Java: The Yogyakarta chapter of the Indonesian
Journalists Association is considering whether to ask the National
Commission on Human Rights to investigate the death of a local reporter
here last month.
   The chairman of the association's Yogyakarta chapter, Oka
Kusumayudha, said yesterday that he would refer the case to the rights
commission if the police investigation into the murder was
unsatisfactory.
   Senior journalists have formed a fact-finding team to assist the
police. The team has submitted five bundles of reports to the
journalists association in Jakarta, Oka said.
   Fuad Muhammad Safrudin was fatally beaten in his home on Aug. 13. He
did not regain consciousness before he died in intensive care three days
later. The Bernas journalist is survived by his wife and two children.
   "If the police neglect to follow up our team's findings, we will seek
help from the National Commission on Human Rights," Oka said.
   According to Oka, the association had encouraged the police to speed
up their investigation.
   "The team works relentlessly, meticulously and professionally, after
all, they are used to searching for facts," Oka said.
   Oka added that the Chief of the Yogyakarta Police Precinct Col.
Darsono had promised a thorough and proper investigation. (har/14)

'Clear conscience inspired Frans Seda'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A clear conscience consistently underlined the thoughts
and actions of senior economist Frans Seda, one of the architects of the
New Order, says book editor Frans M. Parera.
   "In answering social, political and economic challenges, Frans Seda
has consistently acted with a clear conscience," Frans Parera told
reporters yesterday.
   Frans Parera headed the team which edited a soon-to-be-released book
in honor of Frans Seda's 70th birthday. The book Kekuasaan dan Moral
(Power and Morality) is to be launched on Oct. 6.
   In connection with his birthday, a seminar will be held on Sept. 26
to review the political economy of Indonesia during the 1966 to 1970
period, Frans Parera was reported by Antara as saying. The seminar is to
be held at the Catholic Atmajaya University in Jakarta.
   Frans Parera described Frans Seda as a "three-generation statesman"
and a "professional politician" because of his lengthy experience and
his rational way of examining the state administration.
   He kept his distance from religious and ethnic organizations for the
sake of establishing a united, harmonious nation, Frans Parera said.
   "In his thoughts and writing, Frans Seda constantly tries to define
power amid changes with time," he said.
   Frans Seda has always been critical of inconsistencies in the state
administration, he added.
   Frans Seda was born in Maumere, Flores, on Oct. 4, 1926.
   He was a member of a team of economic advisors to President Soeharto
in the early years of the New Order administration. He served as the
minister of plantations from 1964 to 1966 and as the minister of
agriculture in 1966 under President Sukarno. He was finance minister
from 1966 to 1968 and minister of transportation from 1968 to 1973 under
President Soeharto. (emb)

Legislator deplores PDI candidate list

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A legislator criticized the government yesterday for
accepting the election candidate list from the rift-ridden Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI), saying that the list breached the electoral law.
   A.A. Oka Mahendra, a member of House Commission II for home affairs,
said in a hearing with Minister of Home Affairs Yogie S.M. that the PDI
had listed 903 legislative candidates although the law allowed 850 to be
listed.
   Oka said the electoral law stated that the number of legislative
candidates that a contesting group could propose was twice the number of
contested seats in the House.
   Next year, Golkar, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and the
United Development Party (PPP) will contest 425 seats in the 500-seat
House of Representatives. The remaining 75 seats are reserved for the
Armed Forces.
   Golkar and PPP have each submitted 850 names of legislative
candidates to the National Elections Institute.
   "Accepting a list with more than 850 candidates is against the law,"
said Oka, a House member from the ruling Golkar organization.
   Yogie, who is also chairman of the National Elections Institute, did
not answer Oka's objection. Yogie responded by saying that the electoral
law should be properly abided by.
   Separately, the secretary-general of the national elections
institute, Suryatna Subrata, said the institute would return the
proposed list to the PDI central board.
   "The PDI central board has to revise the list and nominate a maximum
of 850 names," Suryatna told reporters after the hearing.
   Oka questioned why the government had assigned the National Council
for Defense and Security, instead of the Minister of Home Affairs, to
develop guidelines on campaigning for next year's election.
   President Soeharto has asked the National Council for Defense and
Security to draw up new guidelines for the 1997 election campaign.
   "Why should the task go to the council? Is the Home Affairs Ministry
too busy supervising the existing three political organizations to do
it?" Oka asked.
   Yogie said that next year street rallies involving huge numbers of
people would no longer be permitted because they had the potential to
disturb security and public order.
   "We should develop an electioneering system which emphasizes each
party's programs on offer to potential voters. It would be more
educational politically," he said.
   On the heating political climate in the lead-up to the 1997 general
election, Yogie said it was still within tolerable limits. (imn)

Vote-getters not needed, political scholars say

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SEMARANG (JP): Political scholars said yesterday that the recruitment
of celebrities as vote-getters in next year's general election is an
outdated trick to attract voters.
   They said that vote-getters are effective only in uneducated
communities because on campuses and in the cities people know they need
politicians who can really defend their interests.
   Riswandha Imawan, a political scholar from Gadjah Mada University,
said that the use of vote-getters is a trick that tends to deceive the
public.
   The idea of recruiting vote-getters, he said, is to have celebrities
use their popularity rather than their political skill to attract as
many people as possible to vote for the party they represent.
   "Political studies should stop using vote-getters because it assumes
that people do not have enough of a grasp of the political games in
Indonesia," Riswandha said.
   "As Indonesians are increasingly educated, the vote-getting system
should be stopped," he said.
   The three political organizations: Golkar, the United Development
Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), will compete for
425 seats in the House of Representatives in next year's general
election.
   While the PDI and PPP do not have well-known figures in their front
lines, Golkar made headlines for recruiting king of dangdut music Rhoma
Irama, soap opera star Rano Karno and shadow puppet master Ki Anom
Suroto -- to name a few -- to attract voters.
   Golkar hopes to increase its domination in the House from its current
282 seats to at least 299. It wants to recapture the 16 seats it lost to
the PDI and one to the PPP in the 1992 election.
   Golkar has promised the much coveted seats to the popular
personalities.
   "Educated people will certainly ask why political organizations put
celebrities higher on their list of prospective House members than
professional politicians," said political observer Susilo Utomo from
Diponegoro University.
   "If it later turns out that the celebrities fail to defend the
public's interests as they promise during election campaigns, people
will feel cheated," he added.
   MT Arifin, rector of Surakarta Muhammadiyah University, has proposed
that political organizations stop recruiting vote-getters because their
political ability is questionable.
   He argued that those representing the people in the House should be
people who are well-versed in politics and have the courage to defend
average people, not just their peers.
   "The vote-getting system should be stopped if Indonesia wants to see
democracy flourish," he said. (har/pan)

Internal dispute among labor exporters drags on

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): The row in the Association of Labor Export Companies
(Apjati) heightened yesterday with the government-backed leader
threatening to take his opponents to court unless they surrendered the
funds belonging to the association.
   Abdullah Puteh, the chairman of the government-backed executive
board, demanded the old board to surrender the association's bank
accounts and their books peacefully, or face a court order.
   He said he has asked banks to freeze the association's accounts,
which are still controlled by members of the old board.
   He did not give an estimate of the amount involved.
   "You figure it out yourself. Each member paid a membership fee of Rp
5 million (US$2,127) and workers have to pay Rp 20,000 each," Puteh told
reporters after he met with Minister of Manpower Abdullah Latief, who is
also the association's patron.
   Puteh, a politician of the ruling political group Golkar, was elected
as Apjati chairman in a congress attended by 111 of the association's
128 members last week. The congress was boycotted by members of the old
executive board, headed by Mahfudz Djaelani, who called the event
"unconstitutional".
   The industry has continually been beset by politicking by companies
amidst pressure from the government to restrict the number of companies
in what is regarded as a lucrative business.
   Apjati was established in May last year at the urging of the
government to instill some order in the industry. Lack of
professionalism among workers' exporting companies has been blamed for
some of the problems facing many Indonesian workers overseas.
   One of the tasks of the association was to run basic training courses
for Indonesians before they were sent abroad.
   Puteh said that during the meeting, Latief asked the association to
be run more professionally, and that its finances should be made
transparent.
   He promised that under his leadership, he would submit a financial
report every three months to members and the minister. "I have no
problem about transparency," he said.
   Anton Sihombing, secretary-general of the new board, disclosed that
the board plans to "borrow" between Rp 2 million and Rp 3 million from
each member to finance the association's activities.
   But the fees charged on workers sent abroad would be scrapped, he
said.
   The new board will be working out of an office at the Persada
Executive Club in Halim Perdanakusuma, East Jakarta, and not from the
GKBI building, the secretariat of the old board. (ste)

'Hairy pollution crisis in Lampung'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): Air pollution in the Lampung capital of Bandar Lampung
is so heavy that residents' hair is contaminated with industrial waste,
notably cadmium, an academic said yesterday.
   In her speech commemorating Lampung University's 31st anniversary,
Ida Farida Rivai said that her recent study on pollution in the city
proved that there was a direct relationship between intensive
industrialization and population concentration causing increased levels
of environmental contamination in cities.
   Ida, a chemistry expert, said that toxic industrial waste included
gas emissions from motorized vehicles and smoke and gases from
factories.
   Perpetual accumulation of heavy metal compounds such as cadmium, lead
and mercury is hazardous to humans, Ida, who graduated from the Gunma
University of Japan, said.
   Prolonged exposure to mercury destroys the nervous system, cadmium
diminishes the kidney's function and lead can cause lung cancer, she
said.
   Ida, the founder of the science department at the university, said
that chemical contamination and poisoning from industrial waste cannot
be minimized by rejecting industrialization.
   "Perhaps preventative measures and control can be socialized and
managed in a wiser manner," she said.
   Ida also encouraged chemists and biologists to undertake more
research on toxic waste by-products which are inadvertently consumed by
the public.
   "A thorough understanding of environmental toxicology is one way of
improving the quality human resources. It is futile to tell people of
the danger without providing a solution or telling them how to prevent
the danger," Ida said. (14)

NGOs demand controls on land ownership

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
yesterday renewed their long-held demand for a government regulation to
limit the size of land ownership across the country.
   On the eve of the 26th anniversary of the Land Reforms Law, the
Consortium of Agrarian Reforms said the 1960 legislation has not been
fully upheld, particularly on the question of limiting land ownership.
   The 1960 law recognizes the need to limit land acquisition to ensure
justice and recognizes the rights of indigenous people over land, said
consortium chairman Noer Fauzi Rachman.
   But the implementation has not lived up to the spirit of the law,
Noer said. "The 'social function' of the land as recognized by the law
has, in practice, become the 'business function.'"
   The 1960 Land Reforms Law was seen as a piece of landmark legislation
in the quest for justice in predominantly rural Indonesia. The
anniversary is marked each year either with a seminar or other
activities.
   Noer, whose consortium was founded two years ago by 65 NGOs to
educate people about their land rights, said the massive buying of land
is taking Indonesia back to the Dutch colonial era when plantation
owners were allowed to possess massive land tracts.
   Now more than 64 million hectares of land in the country are owned by
20 business groups, he said. Most of the land bought had been recognized
by customary laws as being owned by the indigenous people.
   Noer criticized State Minister of Agrarian Affairs/Chairman of the
National Land Agency Soni Harsono for saying over the weekend that
preserving customary laws would be a "step backward".
   Speaking in Yogyakarta, Soni, as reported by Antara, said customary
laws regarding land ownership would disappear as Indonesia develops
further.
   With the trend toward individual land ownership, these customary laws
would eventually die a natural death, he was quoted as saying. He said
the government will continue to respect customary laws, but will not
help preserve them.
   The government marks the anniversary of the 1960 law more quietly
because the legislation was often associated with the Indonesian
Communist Party (PKI). The party, banned since 1966, politicized the
1960 law, turning it into a tool to force land redistribution.
   Noer shared the view that the 1960 law has been mistakenly considered
as communist-sponsored legislation.
   "The content of the law was actually prepared by land experts from
Gadjah Mada University of Yogyakarta," he said.
   He said the unfortunate association with the PKI is one of the
reasons why reforms have been slow and why massive land buying continues
unchecked.
   Many timber estates, oil palm plantations and the pulp industry have
been built on vast forest tracts that were originally part of the local
people's customary land, he said.
   "The government has often labeled the indigenous people as 'forest
wanderers', but really they are people who inhabit the forest and live
by cultivating it," Noer said. (16)

7-day cruise to Banda Islands

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A new seven-day cruise to the Banda islands, known as
the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, will operate for the first time to
coincide with the island's annual Kora Kora boat race from Nov. 12 to
Nov. 19.
   Sailing on the Modern Group's Awani Dream, the tour will cast off
from Bali's Benoa harbor on Nov. 12 and will call first at Komodo
island. On Nov. 15, the ship will arrive in Bandaneira and be greeted by
dozens of Kora Kora boats, which will escort the ship to the quay.
   "The Kora Kora boats symbolize the heroism of Banda's natives as the
boats were used in the defense of Banda against the colonists," State
Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Hayono Isman says. (ste)

Medication too pricey for 50% of TB sufferers

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): About 50 percent of the 500,000 Indonesians taking
medication for their tuberculosis (TB) stop half-way through the course
of treatment because they are too poor to continue it, a health activist
said yesterday.
   Chairwoman of the Indonesian Foundation for Tuberculosis Eradication
Mrs. Soepardjo Rustam said that the price of the second round of
medication is more expensive than the first.
   TB can be cured within six months, she said, but many sufferers who
undergo medical treatment fail to complete the entire process; some
because they are too poor, others because they think they have already
recovered the moment they stop coughing.
   "Consequently, they have to repeat the medication," she said after
meeting with President Soeharto.
   Community health centers can ask for free TB medicine from the
association for poor patients," Mrs. Soepardjo, wife of the late
coordinating minister for people's welfare, said.
   According to her, TB bacteria can be found everywhere and people who
are physically or mentally tired are particularly prone to contracting
the disease.
   She said her foundation offers Rp 80,000 (US$34) in transport costs
to all TB patient who are too poor to go to the nearest health center
for further medication.
   She said that there are currently about 500,000 Indonesians suffering
from contagious TB and guessed that there are about 500,000 others who
have not reported their illness.
   In 1993 the World Health Organization estimated that 1.9 billion
people, or one in every three worldwide, are infected with the disease.
In the next decade, 300 million more people will become infected, 90
million people will develop the disease, and 30 million people will die
of it, according to the organization's research. (ste)

Public participation in crime prevention sought

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): Jakarta Police Chief Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata called on
the public yesterday to join the battle against crime in the city.
   "Caring about others' fate should be developed to build togetherness
to fight crime," the two-star general said in a weekly ceremony at the
headquarters prior to handing over rewards to a number of police
personnel and civilians.
   "Discard the ego which has become the trademark of metropolitan
people," said Hamami.
   "Should we let a person become a victim of a crime, we could be the
next victim," he said.
   That's why, he said, active public participation in fighting crime is
absolutely necessary.
   "The limited number of Jakarta police personnel and a shortage of
equipment required for their operations could be compensated by public
cooperation in making the city secure," said Hamami.
   Shortly after the ceremony, the police chief handed rewards, in the
form of certificates and cash, to three security guards for their
outstanding efforts in fighting crime.
   Among the three were M. Dasri, 66, a security guard at the residence
of Egyptian Ambassador Mahmoed Mohamed Osman in Menteng, Central
Jakarta.
   Dasri lost two fingers and suffered a serious head wound last week
fight when he struggled with at least five criminals in the
neighborhood.
   On behalf of the police force, Hamami handed Dasri Rp 500,000
(US$212.80) in recognition of his performance.
   "I really appreciate the present, which I can use for my medical
treatment which so far has cost me Rp 400,000," said Dasri.
   "The police gift means a lot to me and my family because I have
received nothing from my employer," continued Dasri, who works for Rp
140,000 per month.
   A reader of The Jakarta Post also presented Dasri with Rp 250,000 to
help with his medical expenses.
   Besides Dasri, Hamami also presented Rp 100,000 to two other security
guards, Mat Sani, 26, and Pulung Mahmudin, 30, for their roles in
stopping a group of burglars in front of the BCA bank in Penjaringan,
North Jakarta, in June.
   Hamami also presented cloth to 41 police officers, who were
considered meritorious but unable to buy new uniforms while they awaited
uniform distribution from the National Police headquarters.
   The police chief then gave rewards to nine police officers who
participated in the recent national sports games and collected medals.
   Each of the nine officers received a certificate and Rp 750,000 in
cash. (bsr)

Man arrested for forging money

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): The Bogor police have arrested one of four people
suspected of forging money, Suara Pembaruan reported yesterday.
   The suspect, identified as Bud, 24, was apprehended over the weekend
when he was about to use a fake Rp 50,000 note at the PD Pangestu store
in front of the Bogor railway station on Jl. Nyi Raja Permas.
   The police seized three Rp 50,000 notes from the suspect, an ID card
and some bank receipts.
   The Bogor police detectives are still tracking the other three
suspects, the daily reported.
   According to the police, the gang members spent their fake money in
Bogor. Then they deposited the change they received from the counterfeit
money in a bank account they had opened earlier. (26)

Worker crushed by steamroller

   JAKARTA (JP): A road construction worker has been crushed to death by
a steamroller driven by a friend in the East Parking Lot, Senayan,
Central Jakarta.
   Lasman, the victim, was asleep on the road he and his friends were
repairing early yesterday morning when his colleague Azis decided to
move the steamroller to another place.
   Azis told police that after traveling a few meters he noticed that
the steamroller was running unsmoothly. He said he thought the machine
was running over a heap of garbage or soil. He was horrified to see that
the body of Lasman, who hailed from the same town of Banyumas, Central
Java, had been broken under the steamroller's steel wheel.
   Azis screamed hysterically before other workers came, the Terbit
evening daily reported yesterday.

Sarwono hails idea to build homes on stilts

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): State Minister of Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja is
in favor of a proposal that homes in water catchment areas be built on
stilts.
   The proposal, from South Jakarta Mayor Pardjoko, was among other
suggestions to help preserve water catchment areas.
   "But the municipality should serve as an example and build its
offices on stilts" in such areas, Sarwono said.
   Locations in the mayoralty have been designated as the city's main
water catchment areas. However, given the relatively cooler climate,
they are also favorite sites for residential areas.
   Sarwono had earlier addressed a seminar, which was held by the
mayoralty, on preserving South Jakarta as a water catchment area.
   Sarwono also urged that more information be given to residents on the
need to build more water catchment wells.
   Given the decreasing amount of water catchment areas, the mayor said
houses planned for construction on plots of less than 500 square meters
should be built on stilts.
   The districts of Jagakarsa, part of Cilandak and a part of Pasar
Minggu, all in South Jakarta, are particularly designated for water
catchment areas. The current rule states that building is allowed on a
maximum of 20 percent of the plots in the districts. In order for a
building permit to be issued, a plot must be a minimum of 500 square
meters.
   A further decrease in water catchment areas in South Jakarta is also
indicated by only two remaining natural ponds, the Mangga Bolong and
Babakan ponds.
   Pardjoko, Sarwono added, could easily secure support from high-
ranking residents on policies to preserve water catchments, as "most
ministers live in South Jakarta".
   Pardjoko had also proposed that the city change rules on building
limitations in water catchment areas.
   But Pardjoko said given the increasing price of land, violations were
likely to become rampant because many residents had smaller-sized plots.
More buildings will be found without building permits, he said.
   A way out of this problem, he said, would be to make mandatory the
provision of collective areas for groundwater preservation.
   He said this was suggested six months ago to the municipality, which
is working on the idea.
   The central government or the municipality, Pardjoko said, could buy
the necessary plots from residents, but he acknowledged the source of
funds might be a problem.
   Deputy Governor for Developmental Affairs, Tb.M. Rais, said in his
address that a maximum of 35 percent, or 800 million cubic meters of
annual rainfall, enters into the ground. From this figure, he said the
city's annual groundwater potential is around 77 million cubic meters
per year.
   As the safe limit for groundwater use is up to 70 percent, or 48
million cubic meters per year, Rais reiterated warnings that the intake
has become critical. The city-owned water company, PDAM Jaya, has only
catered to 48 percent of homes in Jakarta. (anr)

Lawyers demand acquittal of client

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): The defense lawyers of a man charged with murdering the
owner of a recording studio asked the North Jakarta District Court
yesterday to acquit him of all charges.
   "Our client is accused of complicity with two other men in the murder
of the late Beng Seng," said Tommy Sihotang, the leading counsel for the
defense, "so, to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt whether
TP, alias Opiu, was involved in the murder, the prosecutor should have
presented the two key witnesses to testify."
   Nyo Beng Seng was killed in his mansion in Pluit, North Jakarta. Also
known as Darmansyah Sujadi, Beng Seng was the owner of a leading
recording company, PT. Irama Tara, and several massage parlors and night
clubs in Jakarta.
   The businessman was stabbed to death with a samurai sword. His death
drew much public attention because it was widely believed to have been
linked to fierce competition in the entertainment industry.
   Police believe the murder was masterminded by renowned gambler Hong
Lie, who is still at large. He denied being involved in the murder at a
press interview in Singapore last year.
   The two key witnesses, Agiono bin Syafran and Sudartono, alias Atok,
were sentenced to 20 years and 15 years imprisonment respectively in
August last year.
   Prosecutor Muhammad Yusuf told the court in earlier sessions that he
did not call the two witnesses to the trial because they were imprisoned
in Nusa Kambangan, a prison island off the coast of Central Java.
   Defense lawyer Tommy Sihotang said the prosecutor had recited the
testimonies given by the two witnesses to the police instead of hearing
the witnesses' testimonies in court.
   "Article 185(1) of the Criminal Code Procedures dictate that
witnesses' testimonies are those given in court, not those given to the
police," Tommy said.
   He then presented a letter from one of the witnesses in Nusa
Kambangan claiming that Opiu had nothing to do with the murder.
   Prosecutor Yusuf had told the court that Opiu drove Agiono to Beng
Seng's mansion on April 7, 1994, and gave him Rp 5 million (US$2,200).
He said that Agiono used the money to purchase a motorcycle on which he
escaped after the murder a week later.
   Yusuf accused Opiu, of violating Article 56 of the Criminal Code
which states that anyone who helps another party to commit a capital
crime is liable to a maximum of 15 years imprisonment.
   When asked to rebut the defense lawyers' statement, Yusuf said he
maintained his earlier sentencing demand.
   Judge Suwardi adjourned the trial for two weeks to prepare the
verdict. (26)

Clarity requested for 'public info campaign'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): The City Council would like the municipality to explain
the effectiveness of its Rp 4 billion campaign to familiarize the public
with city regulations, deputy council speaker Ismunandar said yesterday.
   The city's public relations office reportedly questioned the deputy
speaker's request, who responded by saying that he was not singling out
any one particular office of the municipality for its fund-handling
methods.
   Councilor Romulus Sihombing of Commission D for development affairs
said last week that both the city's legal department and the public
relations office are the offices most involved in the campaign.
   City Council Speaker M.H. Ritonga earlier conveyed his impression
that many Jakartans are still in the dark about city regulations and
questioned the allocation of the Rp 4 billion (US$1.7 million).
   The city information budget for this fiscal year climbed to Rp 4.131
billion, an increase over last year's Rp 3.61. The budget includes Rp
825 million for a "public information project."
   Meanwhile, the legal department has been allocated Rp 1.07 billion to
disseminate information about recently passed legislation and current
bills.
   City public relations officer Soesilo Darmoadji recently sent a
letter to several newspapers in response to the recent queries. He said
that the funds being used in the campaign are also at the disposal of
other offices, including the Ministry of Information's branch in
Jakarta.
   "We ask for an explanation from the municipality, which could send
representatives from the public relations office to explain the use of
campaign funds to the council," Ismunandar said.
   "We would then suggest that the public relations office coordinate
the other offices which it says are also privy to the funds."
   Helmy AR Syihab, the head of Commission C for city revenues, said
that his commission will formally raise the issue when it meets with
municipality executives to discuss the city budget in October. (anr)

Defendant tells court of previous 'sin'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   TANGERANG, West Java (JP): A 41-year-old woman standing trial for
allegedly attempting to smuggle 9,000 Ecstasy pills into Indonesia told
the Tangerang District Court yesterday that she had twice succeeded in
smuggling the drug into the country in 1993 and 1994.
   "In 1993 I managed to smuggle 200 Ecstasy pills from the Netherlands
into Indonesia through the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. The
following year I smuggled in 300 pills," ELW told the court presided
over by Judge M. Nawir.
   Motivated by her desire to make a large sum of money, the defendant
confessed that she stashed 9,000 pills in her suitcase and sports shoes
and attempted to enter the country on March 27 through Soekarno-Hatta
Airport, where she was apprehended by customs and excise officials.
   "In The Hague I bought for 10 guilder (Rp 14,000) each. I intended to
sell the pills in Jakarta for Rp 30,000 each," she said.
   She claimed that she bought the pills from someone named Sonny Luis
Lai in The Hague. She then boarded a Lufthansa flight.
   If found guilty, the defendant could be imprisoned for up to 15 years
and fined up to Rp 300 million.
   The defendant's lawyers, Nuryanto and Rusdi Sovian, earlier asked the
court to drop the charges against their client.
   According to the lawyers, Health Regulation No.23/1992 cannot be used
to convict their client.
   The lawyers argued that only institutions, professional and business
groups having expertise in public health are subject to the regulation,
not individuals.
   The defendant has no expertise in public health and had the Ecstasy
pills just because she thought the pills could make her a lot of money,
the lawyers said.
   The trial was adjourned until Monday when prosecutor Sarwono will
read his sentence appeal.
   Last Thursday the West Jakarta District Court sentenced Ng Wi Hon,
alias Awi, 56, to 10 months imprisonment after finding him guilty of
trafficking Ecstasy pills.
   The case, the first of its kind in Jakarta, followed an intensive
government campaign against the abuse of Ecstasy.
   The government has been forced to use the 1992 Health Law to

Idea on Jabotabek needs clear planning: Ginandjar

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): State Minister of National Development Planning
Ginandjar Kartasasmita says the idea to unite Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang
and Bekasi (Jabotabek) into one province under one governor of
ministerial level reflects the complicated development problems in the
area.
   Ginandjar said if the idea was accepted, the supporting systems and
all legal aspects should be thoroughly prepared.
   "The idea aired by Pak Emil (Prof. Emil Salim) mirrors his concern
about the complex problems in Jabotabek," Ginandjar was quoted by Antara
as saying.
   Emil Salim, former state minister for both population and
environment, said two weeks ago that the Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and
Bekasi area needs one governor of a ministerial level to anticipate
future challenges.
   He said such a move would enable better management to enhance
services in the capital city as well as support decentralization, which
is needed for future economic autonomy.
   "That is a positive idea. However, clear systems must be prepared for
that," Ginandjar said.
   Presently, governors are elected or proposed by the provincial
legislative councils, while ministers are appointed by the President.
   He said that comprehensive discussions on development in Jabotabek
are needed, citing poverty eradication programs as the main focus to
develop an area like Jabotabek.
   Minister of Home Affairs Moch. Yogie S.M. said earlier that such an
idea requires comprehensive feasibility studies.
   West Java Governor R. Nuriana has said on separate occasions that the
idea could create many problems. One of the problems that should be
tackled is the formulation of the size and status of the new province.
   Ginandjar, who is also chairman of the National Development Planning
Board (Bappenas), said that his office does not specifically handle the
development of Jabotabek. "Bappenas deals with the development of
densely-populated areas in connection with master spatial planning," he
said.
   Ginandjar said he has not looked into the possible economic benefit
Jabotabek would gain from becoming a single province.
   Efforts to deal and synchronize the development of Jakarta, Bogor,
Tangerang and Bekasi have been made by the government by setting up a
coordination body in early 1980s.
   However, according to urban experts, the body has failed in its
function as Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi have their own targets
and concerns with their respective development programs.

Military

   Meanwhile, Bekasi regent Moch. Djamhari said yesterday that Jabotabek
would need a greater military command under one commander, a lieutenant
general, should they be merged into one province.
   Djamhari, an army lieutenant colonel, said this at a meeting with
Jakarta military commander Maj. Gen. Sutiyoso and hundreds of local
public figures.
   The regent said that a greater military command would need to be
headed by an officer of at least lieutenant general in rank if the
province was to be headed by a governor with ministerial level authority
as suggested by Emil Salim.
   Djamhari said that a greater military command would enhance order and
security in Jakarta and its surrounding areas.
   Bekasi is a regency under the West Java provincial administration,
but in military and security matters it is controlled by the Jakarta
military command and the Jakarta police headquarters. (sur/kod)

Our art for sale?

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   The current furor over the aborted auction in Singapore of two
paintings that were allegedly stolen from the National Museum's
collection in Jakarta once again puts the spotlight on the lamentable
conditions of our museums and monuments. The two paintings -- Portrait
of a Dutch Governor Wearing the Willems Order by the 19th century
Indonesian master Raden Saleh and Metamorphosis, a nude painting by
Basoeki Abdullah -- are believed to be among at least six paintings
missing in recent years from the National Museum in Jakarta. More sadly,
the thefts might never have become known to the public were it not for
the fact that public attention was focused on Christie's auction and
that some people questioned the origin of two of the paintings listed in
their catalog.
   Indonesians and Jakartans especially are right to be proud of their
National Museum. Its collection of ancient Hindu-Javanese art objects is
unrivaled. Its collection of antique Chinese and Southeast Asian
ceramics is reputed to be among the best and largest in this part of the
world. Its numismatic collection and its collection of gold artifacts
stand up to comparison with those of any other museum in this region.
   Yet, this showpiece of Indonesian museums has been said by some
observers, in several respects, to resemble no more than a warehouse for
the storage of art objects. This appears to be particularly true in the
case of paintings. It wasn't such a long time ago that newspapers
reported that a number of paintings by contemporary French masters,
donated during the 1950s, had disappeared. Others were damaged because
of neglect.
   Paintings, however, are not the only art objects that are vulnerable
to theft. About a decade ago, about 20 pieces were reported stolen from
the museum's collection of antique Chinese and Southeast Asian ceramics.
A big furor arose over the incident and measures were reportedly taken
to step up the museum's security. Yet, as far as is known to the public,
none of the pieces appear to have been recovered or traced.
   If such incidents can occur at Jakarta's National Museum, which is
the showpiece of Indonesian museums, one would hate to think of what
could happen in museums of lesser standing in our big cities or in
museums in the more remote areas of this archipelago. The Kutai Museum
in Tenggarong, East Kalimantan, for example, was reputed to house a
magnificent collection of antique ceramics. There, too, many pieces are
said to have since disappeared.
   The picture becomes even more dismal, of course, when one takes into
consideration the fact that many art treasures have also been reported
stolen from our ancient temples and other archaeological sites. Years
ago, the heads of stone figures at the Bima temple in the Dieng complex
in Central Java -- one of the most ancient of Hindu temples in Indonesia
-- were reportedly chopped off by thieves. Similar cases of vandalism
for the sake of monetary gain have occurred in numerous other sites.
   It is a sad fact that it appears that thieves are among the first of
us to recognize the value of our art objects. It is well enough known
that art nowadays is in many cases no longer something to be appreciated
for its esthetic value only. People with more businesslike dispositions
have long appreciated the fact that many art objects, paintings in
particular, make good investments. Hence, the flourishing of not only
private galleries, but also of art theft around the world.
   Protecting our art objects by stepping up security, proper cataloging
and improving treatment in storage and during displays are obviously
among the first steps that must be taken. It is to simplify matters,
however, to say that these tasks belong to museum curators only. The
public and private institutions, with the support of private business,
can and should help by raising the necessary funds and especially a
greater public awareness of the value of our art objects.
   As for the present, the best we can do is to try to recover what has
been unduly taken from our national art collections. This,
unfortunately, is not an easy task to accomplish. In time, with better
funding and with growing public appreciation, we hope that our art
treasures can be housed in the proper, modern edifices which they
deserve.

Visa card surcharges

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   Thanks to Ms. Pauline Sahetapy for reaffirming my view that
surcharges on payments with Visa card or in fact with any credit card
are illegal.
   What she omits, however, is to mention what Visa and the card issuing
banks are going to do in order to stop this widespread practice.
   I am using my Swiss Visa card frequently, that's what it is here for.
If a shop assistant or cashier, who after all are only following orders,
mention a surcharge, usually between 3 and 5 percent, I ask her or him
to write this clearly on the credit slip, so that I could claim it back
from Visa Switzerland.
   In over 90 percent of the cases, sometimes after consulting the boss,
no such charge is added. If my ploy fails, I will sign the credit slip
and then send it together with the cash register slip or receipt to
Visa, who, without any fuss will credit my next statement. I suggest
that all cardholders do the same. As this process will mean a lot of
work for the banks they may kneel on their contract partners -- the
shops.
   The card issuing banks on the other hand should inform their
customers of their right to refuse surcharges, not just encourage them
to report errant shop-owners, and that without telling us what the
consequences, if any, are.

Dewi A. Rais Abin

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   Thank you for printing on Sept. 21 a photograph of my husband and I
on the occasion of the launching of my book Notes from Sinai: A
Nostalgia on Sept. 20.
   I would like to clarify that my husband, retired Lt.Gen. Rais Abin,
is a former commander of the United Nations Emergency Force-Middle East.
The force comprised seven contingents from seven countries: Canada,
Finland, Sweden, Ghana, Indonesia, Australia and Poland. He was not the
commander of the Indonesian contingent which you referred to as the
Indonesian Peacekeeping Force. The Indonesian Peacekeeping Force was the
Indonesian contingent usually called Batt. Garuda.
   The Indonesian contingent was one among seven contingents of other
countries which were assigned to the United Nations Emergency Force-
Middle East. My husband happened to be force's commander.

Polio vaccine safe

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   It is most unfortunate that a child died on the day of National
Immunization Day and gave the impression to some that this death was
associated with polio vaccine (Sept. 12, 1996). Careful investigation by
the health authorities found that this child had been ill for several
days and happened to receive a dose of polio vaccine orally hours prior
to his death. There is no logical association of the death of this child
with the oral polio vaccine.
   We wish to point out that with more than 200 million doses of oral
polio vaccine given annually worldwide, there is not a single known
adverse effect within hours after vaccination. The short term safety
record of oral polio is incontrovertibly established. It is through such
efforts as the National Immunization days that Indonesia has an
excellent chance of eliminating polio within the next few years. We hope
this incident, which is not related to polio vaccine, will not detract
from the current effort of eliminating one of the most deadly disease of
childhood.
   What is more unfortunate than the case reported on Sept. 12 however
is the unreported fact that 1000 under-five children still die everyday
in Indonesia, mainly as a result of relatively easily preventable
illness, and that the Ministry of Health and ourselves are committed to
dramatically reduce this toll. This effort deserves financial and other
support from all sectors of society.

Museums need help to protect cultural legacy

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 7

   JAKARTA (JP): Fine art is becoming more popular in Indonesia, but
this new found appreciation is not all positive.
   When at least six paintings were allegedly stolen from the National
Museum recently, the thieves took advantage of the dilapidated condition
of Indonesian museums.
   There are now more painters and art collectors in Indonesia, and the
works of a few painters have improved tremendously. There are also
significant increases in the quantity and quality of art exhibitions
held by galleries. The galleries are being run with increasing
professionalism. And art writers are working with them closely to
promote their shows.
   While the artists, galleries and art writers have been quick to meet
the challenge of an Indonesian art boom, museums have failed to develop
as quickly, due to their limited budgets and authority. "I feel sorry
about what happened at the National Museum, but honestly it could easily
have happened in any museum in Indonesia. We need to give more attention
to the registration and storage systems of our museums," said Sudarmadji
Damais, the head of Jakarta History Museum at Taman Fatahillah, Central
Jakarta.
   The government is beginning to pay more attention to its museums, but
its efforts need public and private sector support.
   The public must pay more attention to its museums. "We need to be
more respectful toward our cultural heritage," said Guruh Soekarnoputra,
an artist and art collector, in response to the recent theft. Hopefully
this incident will make the community pay more attention toward cultural
patrimony in Indonesia, especially toward art in museums.
   The municipal government of Jakarta is working hard to improve its
museums. Its own fine art museum is being renovated in response to
greater public interest in art, particularly in paintings.
   Perhaps the time has come for both the public and the private sector
to establish museums which are not merely warehouses for works of art
and culture, but also institutions of learning through the display of
educational exhibits and places where people can enjoy and pursue their
interests. It seems that it is time for the concept of a National Art
Gallery to be planned and realized.

Mystery of missing RI paintings puzzles art world

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 7

By Amir Sidharta

   JAKARTA (JP): The Indonesian art world was shocked by the news of the
alleged theft of six paintings from Jakarta's National Museum. Even more
shocking was the fact that at least two of the allegedly stolen
paintings, A Nude (Metamorphosis)  by Basoeki Abdullah and Portrait of a
Dutch Governor Wearing the Willems Order by Raden Saleh, may have been
included in the catalog of the upcoming Christie's auction in early
October 1996.
   A cartoon by GM Sudarta published in last Friday's Kompas showed a
Christie's employee auctioning the Bronze elephant which symbolizes the
National Museum, also popularly known as Gedung Gajah or "Elephant
Building".  It clearly implied that the 230-year-old auction house was
in the business of auctioning off Indonesia's national treasures.
   In fact, the alleged theft would have probably not been revealed if
it were not for the publication of the auction catalog. Members of the
Basoeki Abdullah estate recognized lot 319 in the catalog, A Nude,  as
Metamorphosis, one of the paintings that was in the custody of the
National Museum. Meanwhile, lot 363 bore great resemblance to a painting
reproduced in a catalog published by the Directorate of Culture of the
Ministry of Education and Culture, in preparation for the National Art
Gallery in 1988. The pictures in the catalog were almost identical.
There was a green stain on the figure's trousers, and damage was seen in
the same location on both reproductions. The only difference was that in
the later publication (the Christie's catalog), to the right of  the
figure's face, the painting had been torn and poorly restored.
   Although auction houses mainly facilitate the sale of artworks at the
highest possible prices according to the market condition in a certain
region, they also become centers of documentation. "That is why we need
Christie's. It records much of the changing of hands in the world of
art," said Sudarmadji Damais, head of the Jakarta History Museum at
Taman Fatahilah after hearing about the alleged theft last week.
   "Christie's often helps locate stolen art," someone in the field of
art auctions explained. Perhaps it has in other parts of the world. But
in this case, we can only hope that the paintings will be returned.
   The reappearance of allegedly stolen Indonesian paintings in
Christie's auction of Southeast Asian paintings has happened previously.
One of Ida Bagus Made's 14 paintings, which was stolen a while ago, and
a Basoeki Abdullah's from the collection of former president Sukarno
were offered at the Christie's auction in March 1995. However, because
of insufficient evidence, no investigation was pursued. Neither Ida
Bagus Made nor Guruh Soekarnoputra, the youngest son of the late
president Sukarno, filed police reports when the paintings were stolen
or found missing. The inclusion of the painting in the album entitled
Paintings in the Collection of President Sukarno, compiled by Dullah,
apparently was not sufficient proof of theft. "It is Christie's policy
not to reveal the identity of either the seller or the buyer of the
artworks in their auctions," explained art writer Agus Dermawan, who is
an avid observer of Indonesian auction trends. Therefore, the alleged
theft could not be traced.
   Whether or not Christie's can be required by law to reveal the
identity of the seller in the case of the two paintings allegedly stolen
from Indonesia's National Museum will depend on the laws in Singapore.
Laws concerning stolen goods differ from country to country. According
to a prominent Japanese art dealer, in Japan, when a stolen painting has
been sold, it becomes the legal right of the buyer, and the original
owners have to buy the painting back from the new owner. In other
countries, legal ownership depends on whether the purchase was made
before or after the official report of theft was reported to the police.

Time

   At this point, we can only predict the time of the alleged theft and
the characteristics of the alleged thief. It might be helpful to try to
analyze the mystery. Considering that it takes at least three months
before artworks can be included of artworks in a Christie's auction, Art
observer Agus Dermawan T. estimates that the paintings were allegedly
stolen before June.
   Taking into account the fact that the estimated prices of the
paintings were still quite reasonable, it seems that the paintings were
probably stolen before the sale of Raden Saleh's Deer Hunt  in late
March of this year. If the alleged theft took place after the news of
this landmark sale, the alleged thieves would certainly expect rather
high prices, at least for the Raden Saleh, and therefore would have
increased the expected reserve price in the auction.
   Unfortunately, the reserves for the pieces remain confidential.
However, it seems that the price of portrait still within reasonable
limits and is therefore considered suitable for auction.
   It seems that the theft also may have occurred after the publication
of the Christie's catalog of the March auction. The catalog revealed the
high estimate of the piece to parties interested in Indonesian art. High
prices for Indonesian art may have seduced the alleged culprits to steal
the Raden Saleh which they knew was in the neglected possession of the
National Museum. It is also possible that the pieces were stolen even
earlier, perhaps after the announcement of the auction of the Deer Hunt
late last year or earlier this year. Profile
   In terms of the profile of the alleged thief/thieves, we can almost
be sure that the seller of the paintings was not involved in the alleged
theft, unless he/she were completely naive. As this case has proven, the
inclusion of stolen items in auctions tends to reveal cases of alleged
theft.
   It seems safe to say that the paintings have changed hands at least
twice before the paintings reach the seller. We can assume that the
alleged theft was masterminded by someone who had reasonable knowledge
of art, and even knew that there was a Raden Saleh in the National
Museum's collection placed in its storage area.
   If there had been any indication of forced entry into the museum's
storage space, the theft would have been revealed immediately. It is
almost certain that no sign of forced entry to the storage facility was
traced, because the theft which, based on reliable sources, happened at
least three months ago, was only revealed two weeks ago. This suggests
the involvement of insiders.

Worth

   Basoeki Abudllah's A Nude has been estimated as being worth between
S$8,000 to S$12,000. Was it worth stealing? If the piece was expected to
sell at around Rp 20 million, then, minus commissions and other
expenses, the seller would have bought it for Rp 12 million at most.
Therefore, we can assume that the persons behind the alleged theft paid
less than Rp 2.5 million for the job.
   Then we can almost be sure that the six paintings were stolen as a
lot, and later sold to the seller as a lot as well. The Raden Saleh is
estimated between S$100,000 to S$150,000. If the painting were to be
sold (which I doubt, because of its poor condition), I think it would
only reach the low end of the estimate. At Rp 165 million, minus
commissions and expenses, the seller would have bought it for around Rp
100 million. For this painting, the alleged culprits behind the theft
may have paid Rp 20 million for the job. Coupled with the other
paintings in the lot, the value of the job may have reached Rp 30
million. This amount would presumably be divided among two to three
persons. Although the sum, averaging Rp 10 million, might not seem
large, it is actually still quite substantial, considering the wages of
government employees in this country.
   If the involvement of insiders is revealed, then punishment is of
course necessary. However, we should not treat the involved insiders as
having sold national treasures, even though they are in the National
Museum's collection. It should be taken into account that the paintings
most likely had been neglected in the museum's storage space and treated
as insignificant pieces.
   Of more crucial importance is to reveal the masterminds of this
alleged theft. It should be stressed that the masterminds have
significant knowledge about art, including Indonesian art, and the
existence of important paintings in certain collections in the
government. They also seem to know that some key paintings are kept in
storage spaces of certain museums, although cooperation with insiders
may lead them to this kind of information. Certainly, there is
possibility that it is the work of a syndicate, which may also be
involved in other art crimes, including art forgery, which is also
rapidly developing in the country.

Concessionaires told to set aside wood for locals

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 8

   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Forestry Djamaludin Suryohadikusumo said
yesterday only 45 forest concessionaires, or about 10 percent of the
total number, have allocated a portion of their log harvests for local
communities.
   He said that 405 out of about 450 forest concessionaires operating in
Indonesia have yet to set aside at least 5 percent of their log harvests
for local people, as stipulated by the government earlier this year.
   The stipulation not only calls for the concessionaires to provide
locals with quality wood, but also to ensure an adequate supply at
marketplaces at reasonable prices.
   Speaking at a hearing with members of the House of Representatives
Commission IV on forestry and agricultural affairs, Djamaludin said the
total log volume obtained from the 45 concessionaires has reached only
84,165 cubic meters.
   He said he would send warnings to the negligent concessionaires and
would revoke their concessions if they failed to respond after a third
warning.
   Djamaludin calculated that if log production from natural forests
currently reached 22.7 million cubic meters and if wood-processing cut
back this amount to 11 million cubic meters, then a 5 percent allocation
of the processed wood by each of the country's 450 concessionaires would
provide local communities with at least 550,000 cubic meters of wood.
   He considered the 84,165 cubic meters collected from concessionaires
so far as being far from satisfactory.
   Djamaludin said that the low supply of wood at local markets had led
to illegal trade of timber.
   Commenting on this issue, Director General of Forest Utilization
Titus Sarijanto was convinced that the government's campaign against
illegal trade of timber would not increase timber prices on the domestic
market.
   "The prices which are currently created with the existence of illegal
timber are abnormal. Once we can get rid of illegal timber, the market
will have its own way of creating the prices... And people will get used
to the new prices," he said.
   He was also confident that the situation would not cause a slump in
exports.
   "What the wood-processing industry must learn to do is give added
value to its products. This way, companies can get more revenues for the
same amount of wood harvested," he said.

Shortage

   According to recent reports, a number of large wood-processing
companies are currently suffering raw material shortages.
   Titus said the total production capacity of Indonesia's wood-
processing industries is presently 48.2 million cubic meters a year,
consisting of 31.95 million cubic meters for the sawmill industry and
16.25 million cubic meters for the plywood industry.
   The wood-processing industries, however, have an operational capacity
of only 45 million to 46 million cubic meters a year.
   Meanwhile, supplies for these industries, which include a certain
amount of trees cut from the opening up of the one million hectares of
peat land in Central Kalimantan, reach only about 36 million cubic
meters a year.
   As a way out, the government has encouraged the industries to apply
technologies with minimum waste and restructure their machinery.
   Titus said yesterday there are currently technologies that can help
companies carry out such short-term plans.
   These include installing machinery that is capable of peeling off
layers of wood barks until the core diameter of a log reaches seven
centimeters -- smaller than the 20 to 25 centimeter diameter core
produced by most machinery currently used -- and cutting back on
industrial waste from 30 percent to 20 percent.
   "This waste can further be burned to generate the boilers used in the
plywood industry," he said.
   Titus said Indonesia's plywood industry production reached nine
million cubic meters a year, while state revenues obtained from this
sector in the past five years reached an average of US$4.5 million each
year, with an increasing trend. (pwn)

PT Gobel diversifies to build three-star hotel

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 8

   JAKARTA (JP): PT Gobel Development Corporation, a major electronics
manufacturer, is entering the hotel business by constructing a three
star-hotel on Jl. Saharjo in South Jakarta.
   The planned hotel, to be called Hotel Clarion Jakarta, is owned by PT
Dharmagraha Nusantara, a Gobel subsidiary, and will be managed by PT
Choice Hotels Indonesia, the master license holder of Choice Hotels
International of the United States.
   The ground breaking ceremony of the US$125 million hotel took place
yesterday and was led by a Gobel commissioner, Abdullah Gobel, Choice's
executive chairman, David Schaefer, and the chief of the Jakarta office
of the Ministry of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications, Pudjo Basuki.
   Gobel said that the planned eight-story hotel will include 172 rooms,
a business center, meeting rooms, a conference hall, a swimming pool,
restaurants and a health center.
   The hotel is expected to open in early 1998 and to employ some 250
Indonesians, he said.
   Pudjo admitted that the 1.5-year construction period is relatively
short for such a project.
   "I am quite happy that this hotel will be up and running soon. There
are currently 11 star-rated hotel projects in Jakarta delayed by the
owners, mostly owing to financial problems."
   A number of star-rated hotels in Jakarta are currently carrying out
renovation or expansion projects, including the Borobudur Inter-
Continental and Le Meridien, while dozens of new star-rated hotels, such
as the Conrad, the Marriott, the Kempinski, the Marco Polo, the Traders
and the Park Lane, are being prepared to open in the city in the next
few years.
   However, Pudjo said, Jakarta might lack star-rated hotel-rooms if the
growth rate is slow and more hotel projects are delayed. He refused to
name the delayed hotel projects.
   "Jakarta now has some 18,000 star-rated hotel rooms. This figure is
expected to increase to 30,000 by the year 2000."
   Choice currently operates six hotels, in Yogyakarta, Bandung and
Anyer in West Java, Parapat in North Sumatra and Pacung and Taman Mumbul
in Bali.
   Choice expects to see four hotels open in 1997, located in the
Central Java city of Surakarta, Batam in Riau, Carita beach in West Java
and Surabaya in East Java.
   In addition to the Clarion Jakarta, Choice will also manage two
further hotels, in Palembang in South Sumatra and Bogor in West Java in
1998.
   Today Choice, which uses Quality, Clarion, Comfort and Sleep as it
brands, is scheduled to sign an agreement with the Lippo Group to manage
the Carita Clarion Suites at the Carita beach in West Java. (icn)

ACeS gets US$60 million loan

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 8

   JAKARTA (JP): Jakarta-based satellite operator PT Asia Cellular
Satellite (ACeS) signed a US$60 million loan facility yesterday from a
domestic financial consortium led by the state-owned PT Danareksa
Finance.
   The nonrevolving bridge finance facility was prepared by Danareksa
($15.5 million), Bank PDFCI ($15.5 million), Bank Niaga ($15.5 million),
Bank Dagang dan Industri ($3.5 million) and Panin Bank ($10 million).
   Reksadana's president, Edgar Ekaputra, said that the loan syndication
was the first ever for a satellite project in the country.
   "This is the first time that financial institutions have joined
together in supporting the infrastructure development of the satellite
industry," he said.
   He acknowledged that the satellite-based telecommunications business
is complicated, causing the consortium to pledge only $60 million in
loans.
   "ACeS plans to look for bigger loans, but we will learn together
first about the satellite business," Ekaputra said.
   ACeS's president, Adi R. Adiwoso, said that the loans will be used to
finance company projects, including the construction of Garuda
satellites and telecommunication networks.
   ACeS, set up in June 1995, is equally owned by PT Pasifik Satelit
Nusantara, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company and Jasmine
International Overseas Company of Thailand.
   By operating a satellite-based mobile communications system, ACeS
will facilitate the making and receiving of calls to and from places
within the spacecraft's coverage. Garuda satellites, manufactured by
Lockheed Martin Corporation of the United States, will allow subscribers
to call fixed telephone users anywhere in the world through its gateways
located in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.
   The cost for using the satellite service is estimated at $1 for one
minute of air traffic.
   Today, ACeS is scheduled to sign an agreement with Proton of Russia
on the launching of the first Garuda satellite in the middle of 1998.

Rukindo admits leakage

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 9

   JAKARTA (JP): The president of state-owned dredging company PT
Rukindo, Baharudin Wahab, said yesterday that his company has
experienced some "financial leakage."
   "Deviation and financial leakage did occur in our companies, but we
shouldn't necessarily relate them to corruption," he said at a hearing
with House Commission V for finance, trade, cooperatives and logistics.
   He did not give any overall figures, saying only that in the second
quarter of this year the company incurred Rp 7.8 billion (US$3.4
million) in "financial leakage" (unexpected expenses).
   Baharudin admitted that his company has been having efficiency
problems and has experienced setbacks due to delays in dredging projects
in west and east Ancol, North Jakarta, and in the Krakatau port of
Cilegon, West Java.
   The inefficiencies were partly caused by his employees, many of whom,
he said, lack professionalism.
   Baharudin also reported other problems that plagued his company's
performance during the second quarter, including equipment failures and
problems with its dredging ships.
   He said that his company expects to receive a loan of Rp 60 billion
for equipment and ship repair. "We're currently negotiating with a
number of financial institutions to get the loan," he said.
   He projected that his company would gain a profit of about Rp 3.5
billion this year. "At the least we hope to avoid incurring more losses
this year," he said. (13)

Inflation rate expected to hit 8.5% this year

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 9

   JAKARTA (JP): The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) expects
Indonesia's inflation rate to reach 8.5 percent this calender year and
8.9 percent next year.
   The agency attributed the high estimates to continued increases in
demand for consumer products.
   A BPS economic forecast for 1996 and 1997, made available yesterday,
said the projected rates are not expected to affect confidence in the
rupiah. Higher inflation is to come from increases in demand rather than
slower growth on the supply side, the report said.
   The government had planned to keep the inflation rate at 5 percent
per annum in the current five year development period, ending in 1999.
The target has yet to be achieved.
   The inflation rate, for example, was recorded at 8.65 percent in
1995, down slightly from 9.24 percent in the previous year. In the
January to July period of this year, the inflation rate was checked at
4.98 percent, down from 6.41 percent during the same period of last
year.
   According to BPS, government policies to fight inflation through
fiscal and monetary measures have not been effective due to growth in
short-term foreign funds through domestic equity and money markets.
   "The increase in the inflow of foreign funds through the capital and
money markets makes it difficult for the monetary authority to control
the money supply," the bureau said.

Investment decline

   It also reported an expected drop in the growth rate of foreign
investment approvals to 15 percent both in 1996 and 1997, from 25
percent last year.
   The projected declines in the value of foreign investment approvals
were attributed to inconsistencies in the government's microeconomic
policies. BPS did not elaborate.
   Foreign investment approvals, according to the Investment
Coordinating Board (BKPM), declined in value by 2.7 percent to $21
billion between January and July 15 this year from $27.2 billion in the
same period of last year. Meanwhile, the value of domestic investment
approvals rose 127 percent to Rp 70.6 trillion from Rp 31 trillion.
   In 1995, foreign investment approvals rose 68 percent to $39.9
billion from $23.7 billion in 1994, while domestic investment approvals
increased 30 percent to Rp 69.9 trillion from Rp 53.3 trillion.
   BPS said that slower foreign investment growth would result in a
decline in the aggregate growth of gross domestic capital to 7.67
percent in 1996 and 7.91 percent in 1997, compared to 8.4 percent in
1995.
   It said that slower growth in foreign investment approvals would also
slow domestic demand and the importation of consumer goods and services.
   The actual growth rate of imported goods and services is expected to
decline to 12 percent next year from 24 percent last year, BPS said.

Gajah Surya to buy a 51.8% share of BDNI

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 9

   JAKARTA (JP): The independent shareholders of PT Gajah Surya Multi
Finance, of the Gajah Tunggal Group, approved yesterday the company's
plan to acquire a 51.8 percent share of PT Bank Dagang Nasional
Indonesia (BDNI), together with four other proposals.
   The company said in a statement that all proposals, including those
for a rights issue and a change in its line of business, won unanimous
approval from approximately 80 percent of its independent shareholders
who attended yesterday's extraordinary meeting.
   The statement said that the planned acquisition will cost Rp 734
billion (US$313 million), representing a price of Rp 1,725 per share,
which will be financed by funds raised from the proposed rights issue.
   "The shareholders have also endorsed our plan to issue seven new
shares at Rp 1,300 each for every two old shares to raise total funds of
Rp 728 billion," it said.
   Gajah Surya shares yesterday closed at Rp 1,400 on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange and BDNI shares at Rp 1,675.
   The company said that after the acquisition it will become the Gajah
Tunggal Group's investment holding company under the name PT BDNI
Capital Corporation Tbk.
   "In line with the restructuring of our business line, we will hand
over all of our multifinance activities to PT Gajah Surya Finance and
we, therefore, increase our ownership from 86 percent at present to 98.8
percent."
   It was reported that Gajah Surya will increase its authorized capital
from Rp 800 billion to Rp 2.8 trillion, including a paid-up capital of
Rp 720 billion, after the planned right issue.
   The meeting also appointed Karmady Arief as a new commissioner
replacing Sutrisno, and  F.T. Chong and Arie Yandi Taswar as new
directors replacing Eddy Sanusi and Hendra Alimin.
   Gajah Surya, established in 1982 as a leasing company, also operates
in general and life insurance, insurance brokerage, stock brokerage and
venture capital, with total assets of Rp 779 billion.
   "The management has planned to make use of BDNI's nationwide
extensive branches to sell a broad range of financial services to
corporate and consumer clients," the company said.
   BDNI, with total assets of Rp 14 trillion, operates 12 subsidiaries
and affiliates, including Bank Dewa Rutji, PT DBS Securities and
publicly-listed PT BDNI Reksa Dana.
   Gajah Surya is controlled by Gajah Tunggal Mulia with 65.49
ownership. The remaining 34.51 percent shares are owned by the investing
public.
   BDNI's shareholders are PT Daya Patria Corporation (with 51.84
percent stake), PT Nusantara Duta Development (5.1 percent), PT
Nusantour Duta Djaya Invest Corporation (3.2 percent) and the investing
public (39.86 percent). (alo)

Indonesian horse riders lack basic skills: Expert

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 10

   JAKARTA (JP): Indonesian horse riders are among the best in Southeast
Asia, but surprisingly they lack basic skills, an international
equestrian expert said yesterday.
   Wolfgang Niggli, former chairman of the international equestrian
federation (FEI), the world equestrian body, told The Jakarta Post after
a three-day coaching clinic here that many Indonesian riders are not
familiar with basic training techniques.
   "I can see that a lot of basic training skills are still lacking.
Maybe the basics are not known well enough," he said.
   Of 12 riders invited to the clinic only five turned up; the others
returned home after the just-concluded 14th National Games last week.
   Niggli said, however, the riders have good prospects for success in
international events. "Look at Chiang Mai. If only the Indonesian riders
had had good horses, they would have won," he said.
   In the 1995 Southeast Asian Games in Chiang Mai, host Thailand
adopted a ruling saying that all participants had to use local horses.
Indonesia blamed the regulation for its failure to win gold medals in
both the individual and team dressage events. Indonesia had to be
content with a silver and a bronze.
   Niggli, who prefers to come here by himself instead of sending
somebody, said that the FEI issues passports for horses to enable them
travel around the world for competitions.
   "It is still difficult to do more because each country has its own
rules. We can't do much about it," he said.
   Thailand and Malaysia have just opened their borders to foreign
horses.
   Commenting on Indonesia's decision to exclude equestrian events from
the 25 proposed medal sports when it hosts the SEA Games next year,
Niggli said that the country will lose its biggest chance to win gold
medals.
   "It's a shame that the National Sports Council wants to drop
equestrian events based on medal-tally judging. It will also prevent the
sport's development here," he said.
   Wijaya, treasurer of the Jakarta Equestrian Association, told the
Post that despite the absence of equestrian events in the SEA Games, two
series of the Volvo World Cup will be staged here in September next
year.
   The first leg of the tournament will be held on Sept. 7 at the
Arthayasa Stable in Cinere, South Jakarta, which is owned by Radinal
Moochtar's son Rafiq Radinal. The second leg will be staged a week later
at the Ciater Stables in Sukabumi, West Java.
   The championships will feature dressage, jumping and three-day-event
competitions. (yan)

Games medal winners cash in on victories

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 10

   JAKARTA (JP): Cash bonuses for National Games winners made the
headlines in the country's sports pages over the weekend after 12 days
of hectic competition finished Friday.
   The size of the awards, a preferable substitute for traditional
floral garlands, varied from province to province, but there is no
denying that the vast majority of medal winners across the archipelago
are richer than they were before the Games.
   Central Java is the only province not rewarding its sporting heroes.
Governor Suwardi told his athletes arriving in Semarang Sunday that his
administration would not provide anything for the medalists.
   "As long as I am at the helm of this province, there will be no cash
bonuses for Central Java's athletes. For those who don't agree with my
policy I'll let you race to other provinces for cash," Suwardi was
quoted by Antara as saying,
   Leftovers from the province's Games budget are to be used to build
sports facilities, said the governor.
   Suwardi promised that rewards will be given in other forms, such as
jobs in provincial offices and direct admittance to state-run
universities.
   In Kendari, Governor La Ode Kaimoeddin handed out Rp 5 million
(US$2,146) to each of Southeast Sulawesi's 11 gold medalists, Rp 3
million to the four silver medalists and Rp 2 million to the nine
athletes who won bronzes during a ceremony yesterday attended by
Minister of Public Works Radinal Moochtar, who was there on an official
visit.
   The province finished 14th in the medal standings, three places lower
than three years ago. Nine of the golds in this year's Games came from
water sports.
   "Don't look at the amount, which may be less than that received by
athletes from other provinces. We have to thank this province's 1.4
million people who contributed to the bonuses," Kaimoeddin said.
   Jakarta's medal winners are enjoying the biggest bonuses, with each
gold medalist receiving three times the amount given to their Southeast
Sulawesi counterparts. A Jakartan silver medalist is Rp 7.5 million
richer, while the bronze medalists bagged Rp 4 million.
   Each member of a gold, silver and bronze medal-winning team received
Rp 7.5 million, Rp 5 million and Rp 2.5 million respectively. And
athletes who left the Games empty-handed were awarded consolation
bonuses of Rp 1 million.
   Record-breaking performances were also worth whopping bonuses, with a
Southeast Asian Games mark priced at Rp 5 million, a national record
worth Rp 3 million and a meet record going for Rp 2.5 million.
   "The amount of the bonuses is small compared to your efforts and I
don't think that you fought for glory because of the bonuses," Governor

Sending a Perfectly Terrible Year Into History, Yen & Stocks Soar

     Sending what was a perfectly terrible year firmly into
history, the Tokyo markets opened 1996 with a tremendous surge,
in a half day session today. The dollar climbed above Yen 105 for
the first time since June of 1994, and the stock market soared
750 points, or 3.77% to close at 20,618.00 on the Nikkei, its
highest finish since September 2, 1994. Helped along by heavy
foreign buying, about 400 million shares changed hands on the
Tokyo Exchange--close to double the volume in many full day
sessions of recent months. Stock prices had climbed sharply in
the week before shogatsu, the year-end holiday, finishing above
20,000 at midweek before dropping back a bit before the year
ended. Tokyo brokers told news agency reporters they believe
foreign buying will continue because the higher dollar will help
corporate profits, and Japanese stocks are currently underpriced
in comparison to New York and other foreign markets. It was all a
sharp contrast to last year's opening, when prices fell for five
days running and volume dropped to levels that hadn't been seen
since the early 1960s, setting a tone that persisted through much
of Japan's most troublesome year since 1945.

MoF Vice Minister Shinozawa Resigns After Just Seven Months on
Job

     In a move that jolted Kasumigaseki just as the government
was shutting down for the year-end holiday, Vice Finance Minister
Kyosuke Shinozawa resigned 12/29 after just seven months as
Japan's most powerful bureaucrat, the shortest incumbency ever.
His successor is National Tax Administration Agency director
general Tadashi Ogawa, a former administrative secretary to
Noboru Takeshita. Shinozawa said he quit to help "renovate the
hearts and minds... and lift up morale" at MoF. Both he and
Finance Minister Takemura vehemently denied he was taking
responsibility for anything specific. But reports said there was
no doubt his departure stemmed from MoF's inept handling of a
several financial crises culminating in the controversy over use
of government funds to bail the banks out from under trillions of
yen in bad debt owed by seven jusen or mortgage lenders (Digest,
12/20-22). Asahi said Shinozawa acted to prevent a politically
disruptive interrogation by the opposition Shinshinto when the
Diet reconvenes late this month. Shinshinto's new president
Ichiro Ozawa is already attacking on the issue. Persistent calls
are also heard for Takemura's head, but the Finance Minister
huffed that "My responsibility, which I have to carry out, is to
resolve the housing loan problem."
     Punishment: Shinozawa is the second vice minister in a row
to leave before his time. Predecessor Jiro Saito was forced out
in May, a month before his term was up, in what was widely
interpreted as punishment both for MoF's ineptitude and for his
connections to the political opposition. Taken together, their
departures are read as a signal that the ministry's formerly
uncontested clout is in deep decline--and more broadly, so is the
general power of Japan's almighty central bureaucracy. "I never
thought the post of Finance vice minister could be so fragile,"
one bureaucrat told Asahi. But several commentaries also observed
that one resignation or even several won't cure incompetence and
misbehavior. "The problem is that once well-functioning decision
making system made up of bureaucrats and politicians no longer
works in today's dynamically changing economy. Unless the
government and the ruling parties tackle this problem straight
forwardly, there will be no essential difference regardless of
how many vice ministers' heads fall," Yomiuri lamented.

Despite MoF Assurances on Bank Crisis, S&P, Moody's Lower Debt
Ratings

     The Finance Ministry's self-assured contention that the
jusen [mortgage lender] settlement and other actions to shore up
the financial system have finally brought the banking crisis
under control (Digest, 12/20-22), didn't cut much ice with
American rating agencies. Standard and Poor's lowered the debt
ratings of seven major Japanese banks over the year-end, and
Moody's did so on two large regionals. Affected were Mitsubishi,
Sumitomo, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Sanwa, Fuji, its Chicago subsidiary
Heller Financial, Sakura, Industrial Bank of Japan, Hokkaido Bank
and Ashikaga Bank. S&P said bluntly that Japanese banks "remain
under considerable stress resulting from a high level of under-
reserved problem loans, exacerbated by a continuous slide in real
estate prices." The big banks, said S&P are also plagued by low
profitability, serious difficulties in foreclosing on property,
and quite possibly by exposure to the problem loans of many
smaller financial institutions. Moody's added that with property
values still falling, actual bad loan losses could well be larger
than anyone now imagines. About the only thing that will get the
banks healthy again, S&P said, is either a general economic
pickup that generates an ability among borrowers to pay, or a
turnaround in property prices.

Farm Co-op Banks Hold Yen 2 Trillion in Bad Loans To Other
Institutions

     The farm co-op banks, whose political allies limited their
losses in the collapse of the seven jusen to Yen 530 billion
($5.1 billion), are owed an additional Yen 5.1 trillion ($49.5
billion) by 68 other nonbank lenders--and more than Yen 2
trillion ($20 billion) is a dead loss, Yomiuri reported 1/1. The
paper said 27 of the lenders are paying no interest or making
reduced payments on Yen 2.23 trillion owed to the co-op banks.
Largest of the debtors is Nippon Lease, an affiliate of Long Term
Credit Bank of Japan, which owes them Yen 456.2 billion. LTCBJ
hasn't asked the co-ops to forgive any of the debt yet, Yomiuri
said, but Nichiboshin wants them to abandon some of the Yen 41.8
billion it owes, and Yen 21.3 billion owed by Hyogin Factor, a
subsidiary of bankrupt Hyogo Bank, is gone. Largest single lender
among the co-ops is their central bank, Norinchukin, with Yen
551.9 billion outstanding, but the National Federation of
Agricultural Co-op Mutual Aid Associations and its 47 prefectural
chapters hold Yen 720.3 billion in loans among them, while
separate prefectural co-op associations hold the remaining Yen
609.7 billion.

Leading Indicators Climbed To 80, But Other Statistics Are Mixed
Bag

     The index of leading indicators climbed to 80 on a scale of
100 in October, the Economic Planning Agency reported 12/26. That
was its first trip in six months over 50, the point at which it
theoretically begins to predict expansion 6-9 months hence. But
other statistics reported over the year end, many of them
November numbers, were mixed at best, with a majority of them
still pointing down. Details:
     -- Retail sales by major department stores and supermarkets
fell 0.5% from a year ago in November, to Yen 1.84 trillion, MITI
said. Department stores gained 0.1% to Yen 904 billion but
supermarkets fell 1.1% to Yen 932 billion. October sales had
fallen 3.2%.
     -- The Prime Minister's office said consumer prices through
November averaged 0.7% below a year ago, and added that if the
trend continued through December Japan would have seen its first
full year of deflation since 1958. Prices in Tokyo were actually
off 0.5% from a year ago in December.
     -- November industrial production gained 0.5% from a year
ago, MITI reported 12/27, adding that manufacturers it surveyed
reported plans to raise output in December and January. Chief
statistician Harumi Takahashi told reporters she expects 4th
quarter output to gain 0.9% from a year ago. "Industrial
production is better than we had expected," she said.
     -- New construction orders to 50 major companies in November
fell 10.4% from a year ago to Yen 1.4 trillion yen, the
Construction Ministry reported 12/27.
     -- MOC also said November housing starts gained 0.1% from a
year ago to 137,180, the first rise after eight months of
decline. Private homes fell 8% to 45,953 and company housing
dropped 2.8% to 2,314, but rental units gained 2.6% to 56,040--
and housing for sale (mainly condos) climbed 9.4% to 32,862.
     -- MITI said 12/25 it forecasts crude steel production will
fall 9.2% from a year ago to 23.2 million tons in the first
quarter of 1996.
     -- November unemployment climbed to 3.4% after six months at
3.2% (see Labor).

Ozawa Wins Shinshinto Presidency in a Walk, But Unity is a
Question

     Longtime behind-the-throne power broker Ichiro Ozawa moved a
long step toward putting himself in the seat of authority by
defeating erstwhile ally Tsutomu Hata 2-to-1 for the presidency
of Shinshinto, 12/28. Ozawa got into the race only after Hata's
people started to talk about removing him as secretary general, a
spot he'd held since he organized the party. But with a little
help from his friends in organized labor and other local groups,
he managed in two weeks to put together a 1,120,012 to 566,998
rout of the former prime minister. That tally included anybody
willing to pony up Yen 1,000 ($10) for the right to cast a
ballot. Among the 223,578 regular party members, Ozawa garnered
only a slim margin. Most commentary approved his enunciation of
clear policy proposals, over Hata's emphasis on consensus-
building, and suggested that once LDP President Hashimoto takes
over from Prime Minister Murayama, Japan will finally return to
real politics.
     No Shutting Up: Always provided Ozawa can hold his forces
together. Neither Hata nor his allies seem in a mood to shut up
and follow the leader. About 15 Hata supporters, including former
Prime Minister Hosokawa, said they'll organize yet another "study
group" (read incipient faction). Ozawa put Hata, former prime
ministers Hosokawa and Kaifu, and other senior politicians on a
board of senior advisors, but several said they will continue to
criticize him. He named as his secretary general Takashi Yonezawa
who once held the same job in the old Democratic Socialist party,
and who had delivered the union vote for Ozawa. He kept follower
Kozo Watanabe as Political Affairs chairman, but coopted longtime
critic Kazuo Aichi, a Hata man, as policy chairman, and named
another Hata backer, former postal minister Hajime Funada as his
political affairs deputy.

Dietman Yamaguchi Indicted for Illegal Loans from Failed Credit
Associations

     Tokyo prosecutors indicted former Labor Minister Toshio
Yamaguchi 12/27 on embezzlement, fraud and other charges,
culminating a year's investigation into financial irregularities
of two defunct Tokyo credit co-ops, Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen.
Yamaguchi is accused of conspiring with former Tokyo Kyowa
director Harunori Takahashi to get Yen 2.7 billion in unsecured
loans that are in default. The fraud charge stems from a
conspiracy to extract Yen 180 million from Kumamoto Engineering
University, ostensibly to help build the `Washington
International University' project in Reston, VA., though there
was no prospect of construction. Those funds also went to pay off
debts of his family firm. He is also accused of using assets of
non-profit foundations he created as collateral for other loans
from the two credit co=ops--and of perjuring himself before the
Diet by testifying that he knew nothing of the conspiracies.
Prosecutors said their year-long investigation of the two
institutions uncovered Yen 38.2 billion in illegal loans to a
variety of people, a record in a Japanese bank fraud case.

Report That Murayama Agreed to Hand Power to Hashimoto Is Denied

     Yomiuri reported 12/31 that Prime Minister Murayama has
secretly agreed to hand his office over to LDP president Ryutaro
Hashimoto in April, but Murayama himself denied it, and perhaps
more important, so far you've read it in Yomiuri, and nowhere
else. Murayama told reporters at a year-end press conference he
plans to go to Lyon, France for the next G7 summit in June. He
added that there's no plan to dissolve the Diet. Yomiuri had said
Murayama, Hashimoto and Finance Minister Takemura, hashed up a
deal to make the switch after the FY '96 budget passes the Diet
this spring, and to have Hashimoto call an election about three
months later, giving the Murayama's Socialists and Takemura's
Sakigake party time to prepare. The paper said the switch might
not happen until late April because President Clinton is due to
visit April 17-18, and Murayama is going to an atomic energy
summit in Moscow April 19.

Clinton Reschedules Japan Visit for April 17

     The White House said 12/26 that President Clinton
rescheduled his state visit to Japan April 17-18, on his way to
Moscow to see Boris Yeltsin and attend the atomic energy summit.
Clinton canceled a trip in November for the ASEAN summit and a
follow on visit to Tokyo because of the U.S. government shutdown.
Main purpose of the visit is to issue a joint declaration that
the U.S.-Japan security relationship is intact and should remain
so despite the end of the Cold War and a measure of public
unhappiness with the presence of U.S. troops, exacerbated by the
Okinawa rape.

Lockheed Martin, Timken, Other U.S. Firms Plan Joint Japan
Business Base

     Lockheed Martin, Timken and other U.S. firms are laying
plans to establish a joint business base in Japan that they hope
will allow them to serve the Japanese market better while keeping
costs to a minimum, Nihon Keizai reported. So far, seven firms
including Caterpillar, Cooper Automotive, and electrical parts
maker AMP have agreed to join, and the group wants to attract at
least 20 companies before making a firm go-ahead decision. But it
already has the unreserved support of MITI and is likely to get
both tax breaks and a low-interest loan from the Japan
Development Bank to execute the project, Nikkei said. The
planners are looking for a 30-year lease on 20,000-30,000 sq.m.
(215-325,000 sq.ft.) of floor space that could be subdivided into
individual company offices, small R&D facilities, design shops,
conference rooms and an exhibit hall for joint use. Even
companies that already have offices in Japan would benefit from
using the joint facilities, the paper said. The group is working
with MITI and local governments to pick a location early this
year, and is looking hard at Yokohama and Kobe, Nikkei said.

Nissan Will Move All Sentra Assembly To Mexico, Export Altima
from U.S.

     Struggling to stanch its cash hemorrhage in Mexico, Nissan
will move all assembly of Sentra sedans for the U.S. market from
Smyrna, Tenn. to its plant in Aguascalientes, while raising
output of the Altima in Tennessee so it can export 30-40,000 a
year to Japan. A separate report said it will also restart
production of the AD Van at Aguascalientes, mainly for export to
Japan. Nihon Keizai said 12/23 the Sentra shift will be completed
by 1998, when the car is due for its next major model changeover.
Smyrna currently makes about 170,000 Sentras a year, so the
switch would just about bring the Mexican plant up to capacity.
It made 100,000 last year, vs. a capacity of 270,000. It already
makes an earlier version of the Sentra, which Nissan sells in
Latin America under the same Sunny nameplate it uses in Japan.
The company itself announced 12/27 it plans to resume production
of the AD in Mexico for export to its home market.
     NAFTA: Nihon Keizai said the main motive for the shift is to
take advantage of both NAFTA rules and lower costs in Mexico
generated by the declining value of the peso. Decision to export
the Altima from Tennessee, the paper added, is meant to short
circuit organized labor and other opponents of NAFTA. The switch
will help Nissan make use of a plant that became a white elephant
when the peso collapsed. Nissan borrowed heavily in dollars to
enlarge Aguascalientes--and banking on continued prosperity in
Mexico, it even quit exporting the Mexican-made AD home to Japan.
But the Mexican auto market disintegrated: sales are now 30-40%
of year ago levels, and that helped generate Yen 60 billion ($600
million) losses in Mexico last year and this. What isn't clear,
Nikkei said, is whether it will help the company's bottom line.
Given competition from the Toyota Avalon and Honda Accord,
Nissan's U.S.-made Altimas could well wind up eating into sales
of its own domestic plants.

Pressured By Fearful Koreans, Ssangyong Scrubs Plan To Start
Sales in Japan

     Under stiff pressure from Korean makers and officials
fearful that its action could force Seoul to open its domestic
market to Japanese autos, Ssangyong Motor scrapped plans to sell
its Mercedes-designed Musso sport utility in Japan this month,
Nihon Keizai reported 12/30. The company had said it planned to
become the first Korean automaker into the Japanese market with a
location in Nagoya and plans to expand its dealer network
nationwide within 2-3 years (Digest, 12/11). The paper didn't
give details of exactly what happened in Seoul, but said that
Ssangyong, currently the midget of the Korean auto industry (it
made 50,000 Mussos in 1995, and exported 15,000), ran head-on
into worries that its action would give Tokyo an excuse to demand
that the Korean market be opened. The Koreans lifted some import
barriers effective Jan. 1, but the impact will be felt mainly in
the luxury and semi-luxury categories, while the bread-and-butter
market for sedans with engines under 3 liters will be left mainly
untouched. There was also some worry, Nikkei said, that if the
Korean market is fully opened, Japanese makers like Nissan and
Mazda who've been selling technology to the Koreans as a way to
get into the market, might be tempted to cancel the arrangements
and start sales on their own.

Japanese Makers Bought $10.3 Billion of U.S. Parts in FY '95

automotive parts in the first half of FY '95, ended Sept. 30, up
8.3% from the year ago period, the Japan Auto Manufacturers
Association reported. The figure was about $800 million above the
previous record, set in FY '94. About $8.7 billion of the parts
were for use on transplant assembly lines in the U.S., up 8% from
FY '94, and imports for domestic operations totaled $1.65
billion, up 9.8%. Although Japanese makers, with MITI's backing,
refused to set a new industry-wide parts purchasing target during
the autos and parts negotiations that ended in June, the figure
would seem to indicate a substantial increase for all of FY '95,
from the $19.9 billion they bought in FY '94. A JAMA briefer
warned, however, that declining vehicle exports, which are
knocking down production, could limit parts imports.

Honda Starts Using South Korean Steel for Sheet Metal on Minis

     Honda said 12/27 it has begun regular use of cold-rolled
sheet from South Korea's Pohang Iron & Steel for door panels on
the Today 660-cc minicar and the Acty van. The company said it
expects to buy 500-1,000 tons a month for now, or 1-2% of
consumption.

Hurt By Exports, November Domestic Vehicle Output Plunged 9.1%

     Stung by a rapid fall in exports stemming from the high yen
and rising output abroad, Japanese vehicle makers reported a 9.1%
plunge in November domestic output, to 863,460. It was a sixth
straight monthly drop, and among the big five, Nissan was the
only gainer, the Japan Auto Manufacturers' Association said. The
figure included 655,067 cars, down 5.7%, 204,047 trucks, off
18.9%, and 4,346 buses, up 8.1%. The decline was all in exports,
which plummeted 21%. Domestic sales gained 4.6% to 593,073, and
passenger cars were up 7% to 380,405. For all but Nissan, which
gained 7.6% to 143,448 on the strength of a domestic surge, the
results were bleak. Toyota hurt by falling exports to North and
South America and the Middle East, dropped 11.2% to 277,194.
Mazda, as usual, got hurt worst in percentage terms, off 24.9% to
65,789. Mitsubishi fell 15.4% to 106,581, and Honda, whose
domestic sales actually climbed 18.6%, saw production fall 9.5%
to 81,425 because of lower exports. Overall, production for the
first 11 months totaled 9,423,306, off 2.8% from a year earlier,
and JAMA said it projects the fully year total at around 10.2
million, which would represent a 2.4% drop from 1994.

Monju Coverup Officials Demoted; Fast Breeder Program To Be
`Rethought'

     The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. or
Donen said 12/23 it removed from duty four officials involved in
an effort to cover up the extent of the Monju reactor's
disastrous leak of three tons of sodium coolant (Digest, 12/22).
Donen had acknowledged that Monju operations director Yasutami
Omori and deputy Isao Sato conspired to cut 14 minutes from a
gruesome, 15-minute videotape of the accident scene. They gave
the 1-minute tape to TV stations the day after the accident, and
released an additional four minutes two days later, saying it was
newly shot. The Donen director in charge of Monju, Tadao
Takahashi, and a lower level official were also demoted. Reports
called the action highly unusual, especially since the reactor is
shut down and the investigation isn't finished. Some accounts
treated it as a ploy by Donen to get people who know too much out
of the way. "Why do they have to make personnel changes now?...To
find out what happened, it's better to leave those who were in
charge in place," Fukui governor Yukio Kurita told reporters.
     Rethinking: Asahi reported 1/1 that Atomic Energy Commission
has decided to "rethink" the entire fast breeder program, which
happens to be the centerpiece of Japan's long-term nuclear energy
policy. The Monju experiment was supposed to lead to construction
of another and bigger fast breeder a decade hence, and commercial
operation of plutonium-fueled reactors by 2030. AEC, which is
headed by Science and Technology Agency Director Yasuoki Urano,
thinks Monju and its aftermath necessitate formation of "a new
national consensus," Asahi said.

Tomen, B&W to Build Nuclear Waste Disposal Plant for Old Russian
Submarines

     With funding from the Japanese government, Tomen and Babcock
& Wilcox will build a facility to process nuclear waste extracted
from old Russian submarines, Nihon Keizai reported 12/31. The
Russian Navy was found dumping used submarine reactor coolant in
the Sea of Japan in 1993 to Japan's great dismay (Digest 10/19-
22/93). The incident led Tokyo to agree to spend about $100
million in foreign aid funds to help Russia find a better way to
dispose of the waste. The fund, now managed by a joint Japanese-
Russian commission, will pay Tomen and B&W to build a Yen 2.5
billion ($25 million) floating disposal plant, to be moored next
to a submarine dismantling facility in Vladivostok. It will have
an annual processing capacity of 7,000 cubic meters of waste--
enough to process all waste coming from the submarines--5,000-
6,000 cubic meters a year--plus what's stored on land in the Far
East. Prime Minister Murayama will formally announce the project
during an atomic energy safety conference in Moscow April 19-20,
Nikkei said.

Hitachi Plans Yen 230 Billion in Chip Ventures in Singapore,
Kuala Lumpur

     Hitachi is planning Yen 230 billion ($2.2 billion) worth of
new chip ventures in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur that would high
density memories and CMOS chips, Nihon Keizai reported. The Yen
100 billion Singapore venture, with Nippon Steel and the Economic
Development Board of Singapore, will be capable of processing 20-
30,000 eight inch wafers a month to make 16-and 64-meg DRAMs
starting in mid-1998, the paper said. It would be Nippon Steel's
first venture into overseas electronics production. The company,
like much of the rest of the steel industry, has been trying to
diversify into electronics for several years, but without a whole
lot of success so far. The Kuala Lumpur project, a joint venture
with South Korea's LG Semicon, will build a Yen 130 billion chip
plant capable of processing 30,000 8-inch CMOS wafers a month
with 0.3 micron technology. The Malaysian news agency Bernama
said it will be located at Kulim, Kedah. The venture is due to be
organized in the spring, but when production would actually begin
wasn't given. In Tokyo Hitachi said Singapore venture will
eventually create 1,000 jobs.

Takara Drops Plan To Write Software for Nintendo `Virtual Boy'

     The Takara gameware house said it dropped plans to write
software for Nintendo's `Virtual Boy' 3D game machine. The
company wouldn't discuss the reason, but rival gameware house
Taito has also dropped the project because sales of the machine
have been poor. The headset machine produces a red and black line

NEC Develops Flash Voice Card Able To Store 30 Minutes of Talk

     NEC announced development of a 32-meg flash memory sound
storage card called the "Chip Whisper" that can hold up to 30
minutes of digitized conversation. NEC said the card, which
weighs 100 grams (3-1/2 oz) is capable of giving random access to
its contents. With additional chips it can store up to 4 hours of
talk, the company said. NEC said 12/26 it will offer the system
to museums and exhibitions, and believes the technology could
also be used in personal digital assistants.

U.S. Proposes Joint Electronics Weapons Component R&D With Japan

     The Pentagon has proposed a joint R&D program with Japan on
parts that go into weapons used by both countries, Yomiuri
reported 1/1. The proposal was made during bilateral talks in
October and November, and what the Pentagon has in mind is mainly
the electronics that go into such systems as the F-15 fighter,
the P3C anti-submarine patrol plane, and Aegis series destroyers
and cruisers, the paper said. While the U.S. objective is mainly
to share R&D costs, the Defense Agency also sees benefit in such
projects: They would increase interchangeability of weapons and
help deflect criticism about the one-way flow of weapons
technology from the U.S. to Japan, Yomiuri said. But the agency
also wants to limit the proposal for now to "research" rather
than "development" because it's worried that Socialist and
Sakigake politicians in the ruling coalition may object to it as
a violation of Japan's long-standing ban on weapons exports.

Jobless Rate Hit 3.4% in November; Miyazaki Claims It May Signal
`Recovery'

     The unemployment rate jumped to a new post-war high of 3.4%
in November, up 0.2% from where it had rested since June, the
Management and Coordination Agency announced 12/26. Particularly
hard hit were first-time job seekers aged 15-24, for whom the
rate was 6%, up from 4.8% a year ago. That's consistent with
other surveys indicating the difficulty next spring's high school
and college graduates face in finding jobs. But the Labor
Ministry also issued a contradictory statistic, showing a
fractional rise to 0.63 in the ratio of job openings to job
seekers, from 0.61 in October. That led a Labor Ministry briefer
to theorize that with the economy now out of the darkest part of
the tunnel, some people are deliberately quitting to look for
better jobs. As evidence he noted an MCA survey that showed
850,000 of the 2.18 million unemployed in November, up 100,000
from a year ago, said they'd quit of their own volition. The
number forced out of work was 560,000, up just 60,000. Economic
Planning Agency Minister Isamu Miyazaki ventured that "A rise in
the jobless rate can sometimes be seen in the initial stage of an
economic recovery." Still, Miyazaki predicted the jobless rate
will hover at 3-4% "for some time." Because most big companies
seem determined to continue "restructuring" workers out the door,
the Labor Ministry is planning "consultations" with the managers
of up and coming venture businesses to encourage them to raise
employment, Asahi and Nihon Keizai reported.

Matsushita to Begin Hiring in Fall as Well as Spring

     Matsushita will recruit in the fall as well as the spring
starting next year, to make it easier to hire experienced workers
and graduates returning from study abroad, Nihon Keizai reported
12/31. Though the Itoyokado supermarket chain started hiring in
the fall last September, and competitor Seiyu said recently it
will begin taking on people year round, Matsushita is one of the
first industrial companies to do so, Nikkei said. The example, it
added, may encourage other manufacturers to break up a rigid,
decades-old hiring pattern, in which almost all new workers start
their jobs April 1. Matsushita plans to take on 600-700 employees
in 1997, up from 500 each last year and this. About half the
increase, or up to 100 people, will be taken on in the fall. Sony
has been hiring a handful of returning graduates from abroad in
the fall, and Kao began offering research and sales jobs in the
autumn, last year.

Mitsubishi Corp. To Abolish Clerical Track for Women

     In a step toward gender equality in the workplace generated
as much by office automation as by sentiment, Mitsubishi Corp.
will abolish the long-standing jimu-shoku, or "clerical track"
under which thousands of women worked at low pay, with no hope of
advancement, Nihon Keizai reported. The trading giant will set
aside up to one third of its new-hire slots for women, the paper
said. But more important, Mitsubishi will encourage some of the
2,800 clerical-track women already on its payroll either to join
their 6,500 male colleagues on the sogo-shoku "comprehensive
[career] track," or to get on a new intermediate career track it
will create.  The reason, said Nikkei, is that personal computers
now perform many functions previously handled by clerks, making
the women redundant. If and when additional clerical help is
needed in future, the company will use temps, Nikkei said. The
plan, the paper added, is likely to be copied by other big
companies considering women for serious work. There is a
downside, however, in that it will reduce the total number of
female hires, making it even tougher for young women to find
employment, Nikkei said.

Population Growth in 1995 Fell To Lowest Level of Post-war Era

     With fewer births and more deaths, Japan's population grew
at the slowest rate in 50 years during 1995, the Health and
Welfare Ministry said 12/31. Based on Jan.-October figures, the
ministry estimated there were 1.123 million live births during
the year, down 45,000 from 1994, and the second lowest post-war
figure, after 1993. That translates into 9.6 births per 1,000
Japanese, about the same level as in 1993. Meantime deaths rose
40,000 from 1994 to 916,000, the highest figure since 1950. The
figures were particularly high in the first quarter because of
the Kobe earthquake Jan. 17, and a flu epidemic that struck last
winter. As a result, the population grew only 277,000, or 10.6%
less than the 310,000 recorded in 1993. There is a slight hope
for more births this year, based on the fact that there were
784,000 marriages in 1995, up 1,000 from 1994. The increase may
have been generated by a confluence of dates: This was the
seventh year of Heisei, Emperor Akihito's reign, and July 7th, or
Tanabata, is a romantic date in Japanese astrology. Yomiuri said
about 30,000 couples arranged to marry on that day so the date on
their marriage certificates would be "7/7/7."

AN INTERVIEW WITH JAPANESE AMBASSADOR TAKAKAZU KURIYAMA

SUMMARY
       Any change of administration in Washington puts Japanese government
leaders and business executives on the alert.  A Democrat in the White House
after 12 years of Republican rule transforms caution into wariness.  As Japan's
ambassador to the United States, Takakazu Kuriyama is uniquely positioned to
assess the impact on bilateral relations of the transition from George Bush to
Bill Clinton.  In a recent discussion with JEI Senior Political Analyst Barbara
Wanner the ambassador offered some observations certain to calm the jitters in
Tokyo.


Q.     What will Bill Clinton's election to president mean for U.S.-Japan
relations?  Do you anticipate any changes?

A.     No, I do not anticipate any basic change in our bilateral relations.
Prior to the election, however, some Japanese commentators expressed their
unease with Mr.  Clinton because he is not well known in Japan, even though he
visited a few times as governor of Arkansas.  Whenever there is a new president
there will be an understandable feeling of uneasiness among some Japanese,
which can be attributed to a fear of the unknown.  There also was apprehension
about Mr. Clinton because of the Japanese tendency to identify the Democratic
Party with more protectionist elements in the United States.  All in all,
however, it is my impression that the president-elect has a broad and balanced
international outlook, so we can expect basically a continuation of the
economic, trade and political-security policies pursued by the Bush
administration.  Too, there is a solid recognition on the part of responsible
American political leaders that the U.S.-Japan relationship is critical for
both countries as well as the world.  That is why I believe we will see policy
continuity.

Q.     What trade issues do you think the Bush administration and the Japanese
government successfully have tackled during the past four years and what issues
await the Clinton economic team?

 A.     In the latter part of the 1980s the Japanese government and the Bush
administration made substantial progress on the trade front until the recession
hit the Japanese economy.  If you examine the trade statistics you will see a
remarkable increase in Japan-bound U.S. exports as well as an increase in
Japanese direct investment in the United States [see Appendix].   This was a
sound start in building a more balanced and beneficial relationship between the
two countries.  Work still needs to be done in several areas, however, if this
economic realignment is to continue.

       One of the most important factors contributing to the favorable
developments in the second half of the 1980s was the exchange rate
realignment.  The increase in U.S. exports, of course, was prompted by the
appreciation of the yen, which made U.S. products more competitive in the
Japanese market.  As the yen strengthened, the Japanese government also made a
conscious effort to try to shift the economy's gears to take advantage of
developments in the currency markets by implementing a number of measures to
stimulate domestic demand; these had the effect of substantially increasing
imports.  In addition, Tokyo pursued a number of initiatives designed to
improve foreign access to the Japanese market.  These factors have led to a
substantial reduction in the trade imbalance.  With this solid foundation I
think the bilateral trade picture will continue to improve once the Japanese
economy picks up again.

Q.     Do you foresee any specific sectoral issues that may challenge the
Clinton administration in its first year?

A.     Automobiles, automotive parts and semiconductors, of course, still will
be on the trade agenda.  But these industries have engaged in collaborative
activities, and the Japanese government has sought to promote the purchase of
U.S.-made automobiles, automotive parts and semiconductors, which over time
should yield tangible results.  While I cannot forecast specific results for
the coming year I do hope that these issues no longer will create as much
friction in bilateral relations.  It is very important that Tokyo resolve these
sectoral disputes as soon as possible so that imports can increase and Japan's
current account surplus, which now is rising, can be contained.

Q.     Turning to the political-security side of U.S.-Japan relations, I
understand there is growing support in the Japanese government for the
formation of a new Asian Pacific security forum that would involve the key
players in this region.  How would that arrangement complement or possibly even
change the U.S.-Japan security relationship?

A.     We must recognize the change that now is taking place in the Asian
Pacific political-security structure with the end of the Cold War and the
collapse of the so-called bipolar power configuration.  But a great deal of
uncertainty still exists because of the economic and political problems in the
republics comprising the former Soviet Union, tensions on the Korean peninsula
and developments in China.  Tokyo continues to believe -- and I imagine the new
administration also will recognize -- that the U.S.-Japan security relationship
is essential to ensuring regional stability.  For this reason I do not see any
need for or any possibility of changing our bilateral security ties in the
foreseeable future.

       On the other hand, we have reached a stage where we need a multilateral
forum to enable Asian Pacific countries, including, of course, the United
States, the countries of ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations],
Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, to exchange views on a regional
security situation in which all of these countries have an interest.
Admittedly, their perceptions of what constitute security threats may not be
quite the same.  Still, these countries have a common interest in maintaining
political stability and peace in this part of the world.

       The Japanese government feels that it would be useful to have a
dialogue among these countries so that we can develop a common understanding
of the security situation in the Asian Pacific and have a better appreciation
for our respective policies.  Last year Tokyo proposed this kind of
multilateral dialogue using the forum of the so-called post-ministerial
conference of ASEAN [an annual meeting with ASEAN's foreign ministers and
their dialogue partners, which include the United States and Japan].  The
reaction of the ASEAN countries at that time was somewhat cautious.
Evidently, they did not understand what we were trying to do.  This year,
however, the ASEAN countries appeared more agreeable to this approach. We
think it would be in Japan's interest as well as the interests of the region
as a whole if we pursued this two-track approach of maintaining Japan-U.S.
security ties and promoting regional dialogue to ensure stability in the
Asian Pacific.

Q.     In some of the articles that you have written on challenges facing
U.S.-Japan relations you discuss the difference between burdensharing and
responsibility sharing.  Please elaborate on why this is important in the
post-Cold War era.

A.     The notion of burdensharing, rightly or wrongly, often is perceived by
many in Japan as meaning that the United States first establishes its policy
and then expects its friends to foot the bill.  We do not think that is the
right way to manage the bilateral relationship.  If Japan is to become an equal
partner, then we should share with the United States the responsibilities for
political peace and economic growth.  If Tokyo were to participate in the
policymaking process, it would be all the more natural for us to share the
costs accordingly.  We have been telling our American friends that on major
political and economic issues we should maintain very close consultations so we
can coordinate our policies.  If that is done, it would be legitimate for the
United States to ask Japan and other allies to share more of the burden.

       Tokyo's request to participate in the CSCE [Council for Security
Cooperation in Europe] process also reflects the Japanese government's desire
to share more responsibility for ensuring world peace, as does our push for a
permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.  We think that in due
course we will be awarded an appropriate place on the Security Council since we
are expected to play a more active role in the United Nations.

Q.     Speaking of responsiblity sharing and Japan's participation in the
United Nations, not long ago the Japanese government for the first time since
World War II dispatched members of the Self-Defense Forces to support the
U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping mission in Cambodia.  If there was another Persian
Gulf-type crisis, do you think Tokyo could respond more quickly in terms of
sending nonmilitary assistance now that this law is on the books?

A.     The new law authorizes Japanese participation in peacekeeping operations
under the aegis of the U.N.  In the case of the Persian Gulf war, of course,
there was a Security Council resolution condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Strictly speaking, however, Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm were not U.N.
operations; they involved coalition forces led by the United States.  Legally
the cases of Cambodia and the Persian Gulf are different.   But insofar as
U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping initiatives are concerned, the Japanese government
does not intend to limit our participation to Cambodia.  We are quite willing
to participate in similar operations outside of Asia.

Q.     In light of the conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement as
well as developments in the European Community, is the Japanese government
worried that the global trading system may break down into trading blocs that
would shut out Japanese goods -- particularly if the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade talks remains deadlocked?

A.     The Japanese government certainly is concerned about that possibility.
Obviously, we do not want to see the world breaking up into three or even more
trading blocs.  Japan has a huge stake in maintaining and strengthening an open
global trading system.  And with the world becoming increasingly interdependent
there is a much greater need for a common set of rules governing trade.  The
prospect of escalating frictions and bilateral and multilateral disagreements
in the absence of these rules, in fact, creates a strong incentive for bringing
the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion.  On that point Japan, the United
States and the European Community all agree.

FY 1993 BUDGET REVEALS FISCAL STRAINS by Jon Choy

       Moving quickly to counter Japan's sluggish economic conditions, the new
cabinet of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa signed off on a spending plan for FY
1993 that diverts greater resources to public works and other stimulative
categories at the expense of other spending options.  The public had mixed
reactions to this reallocation.  Some observers said that the plan, which won
cabinet approval December 26, represented the most the government could do
given the tight revenue picture, while others criticized it as having little
real effect on the economy.

       The government was able to hold to its pledge not to issue new bonds to
fund general operations in fiscal 1993 only by deferring some payments and
transferring some new borrowing to local governments.  This sleight of hand
underscores the need for major tax reform, according to Japanese analysts.
Given the current turbulent domestic political situation, however, prospects
for smooth passage of the spending package and action on more weighty tax
reforms in the upcoming Diet session, set to open January 22, are uncertain.

       The overall 0.2 percent increase to Y72.4 trillion ($57.8 billion) in
the initial general account budget for the 12 months beginning April 1 points
to the preoccupation that the Ministry of Finance has with holding the line on
spending.  The bare rise in outlays is the smallest since FY 1987's zero growth
but masks a solid 3.2 percent increase in discretionary spending (see Table 1),
although that is the smallest gain for the discretionary side of the budget
since FY 1990.  The growth was made possible, in part, by a 1 percent cut in
transfers to local governments and a stunning 6.1 percent drop in the cost of
servicing the national debt.  Nevertheless, MOF estimates that the total amount
of outstanding national debt will reach Y176 trillion ($1.4 trillion) by the
end of the current fiscal year and then climb another Y6 trillion ($48 billion)
over the next 12 months.

       From a more disaggregated standpoint the cabinet's spending plan for the
year beginning April 1 reflects steadily growing demands on Japan from the
international community as well as new imperatives to boost the sagging
domestic economy.  The difference between the Ministry of Finance's draft
budget and the budget approved by the cabinet is stark and surprising in some
cases (see Table 2).  While MOF granted some leeway to defense spending and the
foreign aid program, budget planners had the greatest change of heart for
education and science as well as social security funding.

       These latter categories each showed respectable increases compared with
the current fiscal year's initial budget, but their gains in the general
account budget placed well behind the 6.3 percent increase for public works and
the 5.7 percent rise for economic cooperation.  When all government spending is
considered, public works outlays will be 4.8 percent higher in FY 1993 than
what was planned initially for the current fiscal year (see Table 3).  General
account outlays for official development assistance will top Y1 trillion ($8
billion) for the first time.  Although defense spending will go up just under 2
percent -- far below the Japan Defense Agency's 3.6 percent target, that gain
is better than the 1.7 percent figure penciled into MOF's draft budget.

       Food control programs suffered the biggest percentage cut among
programs, leaving this line item at less than one-third its FY 1991 level.
(The extraordinary category referring to proceeds from the sale of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. stock is not a program category.)

       As for individual programs, MOF listed the following highlights:

       --  About 7.1 percent more money will be spent in FY 1993 on social
infrastructure, bringing the total to over Y2.5 trillion ($20 billion).
       --  A five-year road improvement program will be launched in FY 1993,
with a total spending target of Y76 trillion ($608 billion).
        --  Government aid to retrain employees or to pay temporarily laid-off
workers will skyrocket to Y50.9 billion ($407.2 million) from Y0.9 billion
($7.2 million).
       --  The Global Environmental Fund will be initiated with Y1.5 billion
($12 million) in funding.
       --  The Japan Patent Office budget will be increased by 4.7 percent to
speed processing of applications, a commitment made to the United States in the
Structural Impediments Initiative talks.
       --  The immigration staff at the Ministry of Justice will be expanded by
84 percent or 168 employees to assist with the influx of foreign visitors and
undocumented workers.  Another Y1.1 billion ($8.8 million) is penciled in to
bolster efforts to control and manage the problem of illegal workers.
       --  Funding for AIDS education and care programs has received new
impetus and will total Y10.1 billion ($80.8 million) in the upcoming fiscal
year.
       --  Income support for rice farmers will be slashed by 25 percent to
Y101.3 billion ($810.4 million).
       --  A program to encourage small businesses to reduce employees' total
annual working hours will operate under funding earmarked at Y7.8 billion
($62.4 million).

       The revenue side of the FY 1993 general account budget reveals the
impact of sluggish Japanese economic activity and MOF's commitment to fiscal
austerity (see Table 4).  Tax and stamp receipts are projected to decline for
the first time in a decade, mainly due to a plunge in corporate profits and
much lower growth in personal incomes.  This is quite a reversal from the boom
years of the late 1980s when tax receipt estimates regularly were exceeded.
The amount of money transferred to public works projects funded by the sale of
government-held shares of NTT also will continue to dwindle; the government has
not replenished these funds since the last auction of NTT shares was held in
October 1988.  Given that the current price of NTT shares is only about
one-fourth its historic high, further sales have been put on hold.  Despite a
projected 23.4 percent rise in nontax revenues (mainly expected to come from
Bank of Japan foreign exchange operations), MOF will be forced to raise issues
of construction bonds by 11.7 percent.  This will push reliance on debt to 11.2
percent in FY 1993, up from the 10.1 percent level estimated for the current
fiscal year.

       The Fiscal Investment and Loan Program, a separately funded budget
directed mainly at capital spending, again will play an important role in the
government's effort to boost the economy (see Table 5).  FILP spending will
rise 12.2 percent to a record Y45.8 trillion ($366.4 billion) on the strength
of double-digit increases in nine of 13 categories.  While nearly all public
works-related categories will post solid gains, trade promotion and economic
cooperation (which funds the Japan Development Bank and the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund) will get a minuscule increase of just Y500 million ($4
million).  As for FILP funding (Table 6), the role of government trust funds
and life insurance monies deposited in the government-run postal bank system
will continue to grow.  FILP's reliance on debt financing, which is expected to
post a large jump after several years of cuts, further shows MOF's constraints
under the economic downturn.

       While government officials and ruling Liberal Democratic Party leaders
have stressed that the FY 1993 spending plan is the maximum that can be done at
this time, critics have focused on several points of the budget.  The sharp
drop in the cost of servicing the national debt, some argue, merely disguises
the deferral until next year of between Y700 billion and Y1.5 trillion ($5.6
billion to $12 billion) worth of payments.  Moreover, even though issues of
construction bonds are expected to be increased to the current legal limit, the
public sector's reliance on borrowing is understated because the central
government will cut tax revenue transfers to local governments while
simultaneously instructing them to boost their borrowings by 18 percent to a
projected record Y10.3 trillion ($82.4 billion).  The expected fall in income
tax receipts also highlights Tokyo's excessive dependence on direct taxes.
Some critics of the government plan are calling for both a boost in the 3
percent consumption tax and a cut in income taxes.  While the LDP and the
government have been discussing these moves, there is no sign that any official
proposals will be made on these issues.


       Some business leaders welcomed next year's budget, but others criticized
the proposed outlays as being too little, too late to revive the economy
quickly.  This unhappiness already has spurred Prime Minister Miyazawa to
suggest that a supplementary budget will be considered for the first half of FY
1993.  The scandal-plagued LDP, however, may encounter the same difficulties in
pushing the FY 1993 spending package through the Diet as it ran into when it
sought to win Diet approval of a large supplemental spending bill for the
current fiscal year (see JEI Report No. 43B, November 13, 1992).

INCREASE IN FY 1993 DEFENSE BUDGET SMALLEST IN 33 YEARS by Barbara Wanner

       Against a backdrop of reduced East-West tensions and recession-related
fiscal constraints the Japan Defense Agency's spending plans for FY 1993 and
beyond were hit hard by Ministry of Finance budget crunchers.  The cabinet
approved a plan December 18 that calls on JDA to slice some Y580 billion ($4.6
billion at Y125=$1.00) from the FY 1991-FY 1995 defense buildup program, which
was budgeted initially at Y22.8 trillion ($182 billion).  The five-year
program, which was based on annual spending increases of roughly 3 percent,
will take its first hit in the upcoming fiscal year.  At Y4.6 trillion-plus
($37.1 billion) in FY 1993, defense spending will be not quite 2 percent higher
than in the current fiscal year.  That increase is the smallest in 33 years.

       JDA was not unprepared for MOF-imposed belt-tightening.  Finance
Ministry officials had indicated in no uncertain terms during November that the
days were long gone of defense spending increases in the 5 to 6 percent range
(see JEI Report No. 44B, November 20, 1992).  In light of the apparent
diminution of the threat from the republics of the former Soviet Union as well
as an anticipated drop in tax revenues in the coming fiscal year even the 3.6
percent spending increase that JDA had proposed for FY 1993 could not be
justified, MOF maintained.  Finance officials initially wanted to slash up to
Y1 trillion ($8 billion) from the five-year defense program and hold FY 1993
spending to a mere 1.7 percent increase.

       Defense planners countered that cuts this substantial risked
jeopardizing attainment of the FY 1991-FY 1995 plan and, in turn, undermining
JDA's efforts to comply with the equipment and the manpower goals contained in
the National Defense Program Outline, the overarching blueprint for Japan's
self-defense strategy.  After two rounds of National Security Council meetings
and numerous cabinet-level discussions in December MOF evidently decided to
compromise on the cut in the five-year plan.  During subsequent budget talks
between defense planners and finance officials MOF also softened slightly on
FY 1993 defense spending.

       JDA officials evidently viewed those outcomes as the best they could
hope for, given domestic and international developments.  Defense planners
suspected when the FY 1991-FY 1995 plan was approved in December 1990 that
inclusion of a special provision requiring a review in FY 1993 could result in
leaner times at JDA if developments continued in line with what appeared to be
relaxed East-West tensions.  At the time JDA budget analysts estimated the
agency would be pressured to scale back spending in the last two years of the
five-year program.  Given the subsequent dissolution of the former Soviet Union
as well as the pinch on government revenues, Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa -- no doubt urged on by MOF -- decided to push up the timetable by one
year.

       Speaking to reporters following his Christmas Day discussions with
Finance Minister Yoshiro Hayashi, JDA director general Toshio Nakayama sought
to assure the Japanese defense community as well as Japan's allies that the
country's defense effort would not be compromised unduly by the tightening lid
on defense spending.  "Despite a very difficult fiscal situation and a downward
revision in the five-year program, we were given a sufficient budget in both
frontline military spending and for improving living facilities," Mr. Nakayama
reportedly said.  The defense chief added that the revision of the current
five-year plan is a "starting line" for a review of the National Defense
Program Outline.  Numerous commentators and politicians have been pressing for
a reevaluation of the 1976 blueprint on the grounds that its Cold War-based
strategy no longer is relevant to the current international environment.

       The defense chief's positive remarks belie the impact of the revised
FY 1991-FY 1995 plan on procurement of frontline military equipment, which will
bear the brunt of the revised spending plan.  Of the Y580 billion ($4.6
billion) carved from the FY 1991-FY 1995 plan, Y440 billion ($3.5 billion) had
been earmarked for frontline equipment purchases.  As a result, the Ground
Self-Defense Force will have funds for 108 new tanks rather than the 132 it had
planned to purchase; the Maritime Self-Defense Force will be able to procure
only 37 combat aircraft instead of 45; and the Air Self- Defense Force will get
funding for 29 F-15s, rather than 42.  The Table shows other, similarly severe
equipment cuts.  Training and rear support will receive Y60 billion ($185
million) less in funding than originally outlined by the five-year plan, while
projected personnel costs will be trimmed by Y80 billion ($205 million).

       Despite the tightening purse strings, Tokyo has decided to proceed with
the planned procurement of several big-ticket U.S.-made weapons systems.  Kept
in the FY 1991-FY 1995 plan are four AWACS (airborne warning and control
systems), 36 multiple launch rocket systems and two Aegis destroyers.  Two of
the AWACS will be purchased during FY 1993.  Although Japanese defense
officials maintain that these systems are needed to address certain weaknesses
in Japan's self-defense capabilities, some commentators contend that Tokyo felt
pressured by Washington to go through with these purchases for both strategic
and political reasons.  At Y57 billion ($456 million) apiece, the AWACS
procurement, for example, would put a dent in the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan, these analysts have remarked.  Mr. Miyazawa also had a personal
political incentive, according to some observers; he did not want to renege on
a commitment to outgoing President Bush that Japan would purchase the
sophisticated Boeing Co.-built radar aircraft.

       In any event, the government's decision to sacrifice the procurement of
other frontline equipment to finance expensive, U.S.-made systems has raised
more than a few eyebrows in Tokyo.  Some Japanese defense officials reportedly
are concerned that the AWACS purchases could force additional cuts in Air
Self-Defense programs as well as those of the other services.  "The huge
expense for the AWACS might destabilize the equipment balance among the three
services," according to a JDA official who did not want to be identifed.  Some
defense commentators question whether the AWACS, Aegis and MLRS really are
needed since the threat of the Soviet monolith no longer exists.

       Japan's defense industry, already feeling the sting of FY 1992
procurement slowdowns, has made its objections known regarding Tokyo's
reordered spending priorities.  Japan's six major aerospace
manufacturers -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries,
Ltd., Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd., Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Co.,
Ltd., ShinMaywa Industries Ltd., and Japan Aircraft Manufacturing Co.,
Ltd. -- estimate that their total defense sales will decrease by 35 percent
from 1991 to 1998, forcing the transfer to other divisions or subsidiaries of
some 900 engineers and 1,400 plant workers currently working in their defense
aerospace divisions.

       As Japanese defense planners begin to reassess how the country's
security needs have changed since 1976, their analysis no doubt will be
complicated by the uncertain transition to a new world order, the global
economic slump and Japan's sluggish economy, a shrinking international defense
market and Tokyo's long-standing policy banning the export of weapons systems.
Those anticipating a timely evaluation of Japan's overall self-defense policy
and weapons development programs should not hold their breath.

JAPANESE AID TO SOMALIA

       Aid to Somalia - The Japanese government announced plans December 18 to
provide $100 million to the United Nations-sanctioned multinational forces
guarding distribution in Somalia of famine supplies for the 2 million people
thought to be at risk of starvation there.  Tokyo set no restrictions on how
the contribution to the Trust Fund for the Somalia-Unified Command can be
spent, government officials said.  The contribution will be disbursed from the
reserve fund of the FY 1992 general account budget.

       Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated that the
$100 million figure was determined based on the ministry's assessment of the
likely length of the multinational operation.  The funds augment the $27
million-plus Japan provided earlier in 1992 for humanitarian aid in Somalia and
for Somali refugees in the region (see JEI Report No. 45B, December 4, 1992,
and No. 46B, December 11, 1992).  Both Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and the
Foreign Ministry in late December urged other nations to support U.N. efforts
to raise $400 million for the costs of Somali operations.

       Tokyo also is considering sending personnel to Somalia and neighboring
countries to provide medical and other humanitarian assistance.  In
mid-December Yoshiji Nogami, deputy director general of the Foreign Ministry's
Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau, headed a mission to Somalia,
Ethiopia and Kenya to study the feasibility of such assistance.  Foreign
Minister Michio Watanabe has indicated that after reviewing the mission's
reports Tokyo will consider ways to channel direct help for refugee and medical
needs in Somalia and the region.  Japanese participation in U.N.-led
peacekeeping activities in Somalia also will be studied, Mr. Watanabe said.

NTT PROCUREMENT

       NTT Procurement - Washington and Tokyo quietly agreed December 22 to
renew for another three years a 1980 bilateral arrangement governing Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. procurement.  Although both sides had identified
some areas for change in the opening round of extension talks in mid-November,
the 1993-95 pact is a carbon copy of the one in effect from 1990 through last
year.  That leaves unresolved the question of whether NTT procurement will be
brought under the disciplines of the international government procurement code
if that code is renegotiated as part of a successful Uruguay Round.  The
Japanese government still hopes to make this switch, which encountered stiff
opposition from the Bush administration (see JEI Report No. 16B, April 24,
1992).  But, like the 1990-92 pact, the new arrangement merely provides for a
review of the bilateral accord should the long-running multilateral trade
negotiations be concluded.

       The American negotiating team proposed the straight extension of the
existing NTT procurement agreement in the third and final round of
discussions.  In the initial talks U.S. trade officials had indicated places
where the pact could be strengthened based on an eight-point list drafted by
the American Electronics Association.  Although Japanese negotiators said these
changes were unnecessary, they were willing to incorporate some of them in the
new arrangement.  In exchange, however, Tokyo wanted to exempt from certain
pact provisions products that NTT buys but later resells or leases.  This
exclusion, which was part of a tentative agreement reached in early December,
proved unacceptable to U.S. equipment suppliers.  They worried that it could
lock American companies out of important market segments, including, possibly,
equipment bought by the communications giant for resale or lease to its NTT
Mobile Communications Network Inc. and NTT Data Communications Systems Corp.
subsidiaries.

       Both companies previously had promised to adhere to the terms of the
bilateral procurement pact (see JEI Report No. 29B, July 31, 1992).  Officials
of NTT Power and Building Facilities Inc., which was spun off as wholly owned
subsidiary December 1, 1992, also have indicated that the firm will not
discriminate against foreign suppliers in its purchases.  With domestic
industry unwilling to rely solely on these assurances, U.S. trade negotiators
apparently concluded that a straight extension was the only way to resolve the
linkage problem.

GOVERNMENT ANTICIPATES SLOWER GROWTH IN FY 1993 by Douglas Ostrom

       Just on appearances, Tokyo could be forgiven for believing that its
official economic outlook for the fiscal year beginning April 1 is, if
anything, too pessimistic.  The 3.3 percent projected rise in
inflation-adjusted gross national product (see Table) is the lowest growth
estimate adopted by a cabinet since the dark days of December 1973 when, in the
midst of the first oil crisis, Tokyo put the economy's expected growth at 2.5
percent.  The FY 1993 figure, if achieved, would represent one of the lowest
rates of expansion over 12 months in postwar Japanese history.

       Some analysts -- apparently including some in government -- believe,
however, that Tokyo was insufficiently gloomy in its December 20 announcement.
In a twist on the usual bureaucratic wrangling that pits the conservative
Ministry of Finance against the fiscally aggressive Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, MOF and MITI reportedly ganged up on the Economic Planning
Agency in insisting that a figure of approximately 3.5 percent be used.  EPA
argued for a number around 3 percent on the grounds that the government's
economic outlook should be realistic.  A compromise developed at 3.3 percent.

       EPA has both history and private-sector experts on its side.  The
government's outlook consistently has failed to anticipate fully either severe
downturns in the economy or sharp upturns.  For example, the economy actually
contracted 0.2 percent in FY 1974, implying that even the gloomiest outlook of
the past two decades was too optimistic.  Similarly, in revising its FY 1992
real growth estimate to 1.6 percent slightly more than three months before the
fiscal year ends, Tokyo now admits that its initial outlook of 3.5 percent
growth was too rosy.  If the revised figure is approximately correct, the
increase in GNP during the current fiscal year will be the smallest since FY
1974.

       Twenty-one well-known private economic forecasters also made predictions
during December.  Their average estimate of real economic growth in FY 1993
came to 2.7 percent, with the range between 1.7 percent (Japan Research
Institute) and 4 percent (Daiwa Institute of Research).  This same group was
less optimistic a year ago about the prospects for FY 1992 than the government
but, on the assumption that the government's revised estimate for the year
through March 1993 is approximately correct, even these private-sector
forecasters were too optimistic at this time last year concerning FY 1992
growth.

       The disagreements among economists inside and outside government
concerning the likely direction of the Japanese economy are reflected in
differences over two key variables:  private plant and equipment spending plus
the current account surplus.  For example, the pessimistic Japan Research
Institute envisages a 3.4 percent drop next year in business investment.  By
contrast, the government expects a 2.4 percent rise.  Given the large weight of
private capital spending in the Japanese economy, this single category explains
most of the discrepancy between the least and the most optimistic forecasts.
In light of the fact that plant and equipment spending remained at historically
high levels in 1992 despite the rapid deceleration of overall growth, a further
correction may be in store, implying a substantial drop in FY 1993.  As a
result, even the most pessimistic of the private research organizations may
have too rosy a view of this key component of the economy.


       Those making higher forecasts of overall growth tend to expect smaller
external imbalances because imports are assumed to grow in sync with the
economy.  For example, the Japan Center for Economic Research, which expects 3
percent GNP growth, projects a current account surplus of $143.1 billion for FY
1993, far above the government's figure of $115.5 billion.  By contrast, EPA
officials now estimate that the current account surplus will reach $116.5
billion in the year through March 1993.

       Even the government's relatively upbeat numbers are not likely to please
the incoming Clinton administration despite the suggestion reported in the
press that the president-elect was very much on the minds of MOF and MITI
officials pushing for a higher projected GNP growth figure.  Slow growth in
Japan, coupled with the expected sluggishness of European economies, could put
a crimp in U.S. exports, one of the few bright spots during America's recent
recession.

       The government's FY 1993 economic outlook, unlike the projections
developed by private forecasters, did not assume any major policy changes.
JCER analysts, for example, built into their estimate the prediction that the
discount rate would be lowered an additional half point sometime in FY 1993 and
that the government would adopt a modest fiscal stimulus package in the coming
fiscal year.  In addition, an increasing number of business leaders are calling
for a substantial income tax cut.  Against this backdrop, the government's
optimistic economic outlook for FY 1993 marks a continuation, rather than the
end, of the prolonged debate concerning appropriate countercyclical economic
policy in Japan.

GROWING GLOBAL ROLE IN JAPAN'S FY 1993 FOREIGN AID BUDGET by Margo Grimm

       While the FY 1993 foreign aid budget did not emerge unscathed from the
budget deliberations of the past few months, spending for official development
assistance will show less of the strain imposed by Japan's current fiscal
difficulties than most areas of the general account budget (see preceding
articles).  Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials said that Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa firmly supported a plan to increase the general account portion
of Japan's foreign aid budget beyond Y1 trillion ($8 billion at Y125=$1.00) for
the first time.  As approved by the cabinet December 26, the ODA outlays funded
through the general account will total Y1,014.4 billion ($8.1 billion) in the
year starting April 1.  A Ministry of Finance budget examiner responsible for
foreign aid asserted in a news conference prior to cabinet consideration of the
budget: "With these aid figures, Japan made the maximum fiscal effort to live
up to its obligation to help developing nations despite its severe fiscal
situation."

       The FY 1993 foreign aid budget's 6.5 percent increase over the
comparable FY 1992 figure is more than double the expansion in total
discretionary spending.  Even so, that growth rate is the lowest for foreign
aid spending since the 6.5 percent rise posted in FY 1988.  Next year's 6.5
percent figure represented a compromise between the 9.7 percent increase
requested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Finance Ministry's efforts
to restrict the growth of spending.  The draft budget issued by the Finance
Ministry held the increase in ODA expenditures to 4.7 percent, but in a
December 25 meeting Finance Minister Yoshiro Hayashi agreed to Foreign Minister
Michio Watanabe's request to restore certain foreign aid funds cut during the
compilation of the budget.  Mr. Watanabe said that, among other things, the two
ministries negotiated an increase in the funds budgeted for bilateral grants to
Y243.1 billion ($1.9 billion), 6.7 percent more than allocated for the current
fiscal year.

       The Y1 trillion-plus ($8.1 billion) authorized for foreign aid in the
general account budget will be supplemented by Y675 billion ($5.4 billion) from
the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program, which mainly funds capital projects.
The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, which oversees the concessionary loan
portion of Japan's economic assistance, will disburse this money as part of its
Y930 billion ($7.4 billion) lending program for the next fiscal year.

       The expansion of Japan's foreign aid budget for FY 1993 allows for
increased outlays in several categories, although some areas have been
trimmed.  Technical assistance, for example, is slated to grow 7.6 percent to
Y210.2 billion ($1.7 billion).  The Y147.7 billion ($1.2 billion) budgeted for
the United Nations and other international humanitarian organizations
represents a 0.2 percent drop, however, from the current fiscal year's level.
Among specific U.N. agencies to benefit from increased funding in FY 1993 will
be the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which is targeted to get Y10.1
billion ($80.8 million), a boost of 4.7 percent, and the U.N. Children's Fund,
which is to receive Y3.3 billion ($26.4 million), a 0.2 percent increase in
dollar terms.

       According to Japanese news reports, the Finance Ministry's foreign aid
budget examiner noted that Tokyo will disburse in addition to official
development assistance $5.3 million-plus to support U.N. peacekeeping
activities in FY 1993, more than double the amount appropriated for the current
fiscal year.  These funds will come from the Foreign Ministry portion of the
budget and will be separate from anticipated Japan Defense Agency expenditures
for the support of U.N. peacekeeping operations.

       Observers note that the Japanese government's plans to increase official
development assistance outlays in the next fiscal year reflect a recognition
that its contributions to the international community should match its economic
standing.  Alluding to the diverse objectives that factored into the drafting
of the FY 1993 spending plan, one Foreign Ministry official commented, "Japan
can impress the world of the seriousness of its international contributions
only by increasing the ODA budget."  Japan's commitment to meeting growing
global needs is expected to be spotlighted when the seven major industrial
democracies meet in Tokyo in July.

       International expectations for Japan's aid program have grown in tandem
with its expansion.  Tokyo's current foreign aid projections for the 1993-97
period are for outlays of $75 billion.  The Japanese government also is working
to address questions about the quality of its economic assistance (see JEI
Report No. 46A, December 11, 1992).  At the same time the growing demand for
resources worldwide coincides with domestic economic problems; that raises
issues of balance regarding domestic concerns and escalating foreign aid
expenditures.  As Japanese decisionmakers take these matters under
consideration, the focus of attention will point to how broadly Japan is
mapping out plans for greater international cooperation.

Japan Securities Finance to ease mortgage requirements+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan Securities Finance Co. said Monday it will ease mortgage
requirements in bond trading to lessen the burden on borrowers,
effective Jan. 5.
     Japan's leading securities financing company said the assessment
value of collateral to be offered by borrowers will be lowered to 102%,
above market value from the present rate of at least 105%.
     The company said the decision is in line with deregulation
implemented by the Finance Ministry and the Japan Securities Dealers
Association.
     Osaka Securities Finance Co. will take a similar step, company
sources said.

Stock market rebound reflects gov't policy, says official+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The recent rebound in stock prices reflects the government's
economic and financial policy, Vice Finance Minister Kyosuke
Shinozawa said Thursday.
     The market must have responded to the Finance Ministry's policy
actions, especially to policy for liquidating ailing housing loan
companies, Shinozawa told a news conference.  ''That's very
welcome,'' he said.
     The key stock market gauge topped 20,000 Wednesday in Tokyo for
the first time since October last year.

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japanese brokerage house Kankaku Securities Co. said Thursday
it will shut down its branch in Los Angeles at the end of this year
in line with its restructuring program.
     The Tokyo-based company said operations at the branch, with a
staff of two, will be transferred to the head office of its U.S. unit
in New York.
     The closure will reduce the company's overseas business bases to
nine -- five subsidiaries, one branch and three representative
offices.

Greater disclosure needed by firms listing on new mart++

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     More information needs to be disclosed by firms looking to list
their shares on a newly created section of the over-the-counter
(OTC) stock trading market as these companies may be fast-growing
but also have poor management, industry sources said Thursday.
     In addition to greater disclosure, brokerages will need to be
more discerning and more responsible when underwriting the shares of
these companies listing on the ''frontier market,'' they said.
     Already, two out of 31 companies expected to be registered for
OTC trading launched in July, have gone bankrupt after twice
dishonoring bills.
     The firms -- a Tokyo-based water processing plant operator and a
Yokohama-based computer development company -- were included in the
31 firms designated by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) as subject to a new law designed to promote venture
businesses.
     The ministry is unfazed by the bankruptcy of the two firms.
''They are venture businesses, and some are apt to fail,'' one
ministry official said.
     The company failures make it only clear, however, that it is
difficult for the ordinary investor to predict the future of venture
businesses, and that more corporate data is necessary, industry
sources said.
     The frontier market was launched by the Japan Securities Dealers
Association with the aim of making it easier for entrepreneurial
companies to raise funds by relaxing the rules of stock registration.
     Next year, similar markets will be set up within the Tokyo Stock
Exchange and other domestic exchanges.

Levi Strauss Japan to pay 120 yen per share dividend+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Levi Strauss Japan K.K., the Japanese subsidiary of the world's
largest apparel maker, said Thursday it will pay a year-end dividend
of 120 yen per share for its business year ended in November.
     The Tokyo-based company said the payment will consist of a 42
yen regular dividend and a 78 yen special payout.
     The dividend ratio is 2.4 times the par value of 50 yen.
     The company said the dividend amount was decided by taking into
account a fair distribution of profits, including a share for
internal reserves.

Local gov'ts to issue 13% more bonds in FY' 96+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's local governments plan to issue a record 18,110.3
billion yen worth of bonds in fiscal 1996, which begins next April
1, up 13.0% over the current year, the biggest-ever growth rate, the
Home Affairs Ministry said Monday.
     The funds will be used to cover residential tax reductions of
1,642.5 billion yen and to invest in 2,030.0 billion yen worth of
public works, the ministry said.
     The public debt accounts for 15.2% of the local governments'
combined expenditures, up 1.5 percentage points from the previous
year, it said.
     The public works to be jointly carried out by central and local
governments include 270 billion yen for reinforcing buildings for the
public use against a big earthquake like the Jan. 17 Kobe quake,
according to the ministry.

Speculators buy bankrupt Hyogo Bank shares on TSE+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The bankrupt Hyogo Bank topped the list of most active stocks
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday as speculators engaged in a
heavy ''money game,'' traders said.
     They said an estimated 12.8 million shares were traded despite
the bank's delisting, set for Jan. 29 next year, boosting the price
of its stock to 2.00 yen per share, double its Friday closing of 1.00
yen.
     Hyogo Bank's operations will be transferred to newly inaugurated
Midori Bank early next year.

Long-tern bank forecasts 2.3% economic growth in FY '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan forecast Tuesday that
Japan's economy will grow 2.3% in real gross national product (GDP)
terms in fiscal 1996, led by recovery of capital investment.
     The bank report, however, said the recovery will be moderate.
     ''The recovery itself will make the transition from reliance on
public investment in the first half to self-sustainable recovery led
by private-sector demand in the second half,'' it said.
     The bank said capital investment will improve and the previous
adverse influence caused by an investment slump which has held back
growth in recent years will be eliminated.
     Public investment will support the economy through the first
half of fiscal 1996 while consumption, which has been restrained,
will improve.
     The bank, however, said the recovery depends largely on how well
the transition from a recovery supported by public investment to one
supported by private demand can be managed in the latter half of the
fiscal year.
     It said Japan's current account surplus will continue to shrink,
declining to 97 billion dollars in fiscal 1996 from 113 billion
dollars in fiscal 1995 and 124 billion dollars in fiscal 1994.
     In fiscal 1995, which ends March 31, 1996, the strong yen will
limit growth to 1.2%, compared with a 0.5% rise in the preceding
year, the bank said.

BOJ to inspect New York units of several Japanese banks++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Bank of Japan said Tuesday it will complete a series of
emergency inspections of the New York branches of half of Japan's 21
major commercial banks by the spring of 1996.
     Earlier this month, the central bank inspected three of the New
York branches of some 10 Japanese banks selected for an emergency
inspection, the central bank said.
     BOJ inspectors have detected some defects in the three banks'
risk management, central bank officials said.
     The planned inspections are designed to prevent a recurrence of
an incident similar to the Daiwa Bank scandal, in which Daiwa's
senior management is charged with ordering a cover-up for the 1.1
billion dollar bond trading loss at its New York branch.
     As a result, Daiwa was ordered by the Federal Reserve Board to
get out of the United States by Feb. 2.
     The 10 banks selected by the central bank have a relatively high
dependence on overseas banking operations.  The 21 banks comprise 11
''city banks,'' three long-term credit banks and seven trust banks.
     In a parallel step, the central bank will increase by seven to
20 the number of banks whose overseas branches are obligated to
accept a triennial inspection of their financial records and risk
management systems by BOJ inspectors, the central bank said.
     Among Japan's 21 major commercial banks, only Nippon Trust Bank
will be exempt from the new obligation, it said.
     The triennial inspection will cover the Hong Kong branches of
these 20 banks, on top of the central bank's current requirement that
the banks' New York and London branches be subjected to its triennial
examination.
     The central bank will draw up by next spring a list of checkup
points for reference by inspectors, according to which the inspectors
will examine the commercial banks' financial records and risk
management systems.
     The Bank of Japan will also make the ''check list'' available to
financial institutions, it said.
     The announcement came as Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura
unveiled a set of measures to help Japanese banks strengthen their
risk management and auditing systems as a way to prevent questionable
financial deals as in the Daiwa Bank scandal.

Creditors to be lenient toward failed Hyogo Bank+

OSAKA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Creditors have offered to allow the bankrupt Hyogo Bank to
recover about 20% of its claims on 16 nonbanking affiliates which
have applied for liquidation, financial sources said Tuesday.
     The sources said the creditors plan to hold another meeting next
spring to adopt a final agreement on the dismantling of the 16
affiliates of Hyogo Bank.
     Normally, the founding banks are required to abandon all claims
on the dissolved nonbanking affiliates to take responsibility for
their failures.
     The sources said Hyogo Bank may be allowed to lay claim to
about 20% of about 292.7 billion yen worth of loans to the failed
affiliates whose total liabilities are estimated at 1,545.1 billion
yen.
     The nonbanks have asked creditors to give up as much as 80% of
their claims due to a sharp fall in property prices, they said.
     The balance will be settled over a period of about five years,
the sources said.

Norinchukin Bank to go into red, farm minister says+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Norinchukin Bank, the core institution for agricultural
cooperatives, will plunge into the red in fiscal 1995 in connection
with the planned liquidation of housing loan firms, the farm
minister said Tuesday.
     Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries Minister Hosei Norota told
a regular cabinet meeting that about 20 financial organs under the
Mutual Credit Fund Association of Agricultural Cooperatives will also
lose money because of the housing loan firm fiasco.
     Financial institutions affiliated to agricultural cooperatives
are major creditors of the home mortgage loan companies, seven of
which are to be liquidated under a government scheme.
     The government's plan calls for the farm-linked institutions to
shoulder only some 530 billion yen of the liquidation losses
amounting to 6.41 trillion yen.
     The farm ministry will study the matter from early next year,
Norota said.
     In the past three years, 325 billion yen has been furnished to
the housing loan companies by the agricultural institutions in the
form of cuts in interest payments, Norota said.
     The burden of the 530 billion yen would undermine the farm
financial institutions' business standing as their internal reserves
are extremely small and their profit margins are also small, Norota
said.
     If they are required to take an additional financial burden,
they can not survive, which would create credit turmoil in Japan, he
said.

Tokai Bank may issue preferred stock+

NAGOYA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Tokai Bank may issue preferred stock if the domestic stock
market recovers in order to increase funds on hand, the president of
the Nagoya-based major commercial bank said Tuesday.
     By issuing preferred shares, the bank aims to keep its
capital-adequacy ratio from deteriorating in writing off
nonperforming loans to moribund mortgage companies, Satoru Nishigaki
said at a press conference.
     Preferred stock is guaranteed priority over common stock in
the payment of dividends to shareholders.
     Commenting on rumors that Tokai Bank may absorb Chuo Trust and
Banking Co. which belongs to the Tokai Bank group, Nishigaki said
''There is no likelihood of Tokai absorbing Chuo Trust in the
near future.''
     He said Chuo Trust's management condition will not worsen so
much in writing off its bad loans to the mortgage companies as trust
banks are expected to be allowed to use their special reserve funds
for guaranteeing the principals of their trust assets, in order to
make up for losses resulting from the write-offs.

IC, paper makers to enjoy good business in '96+

NAGOYA, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Tokai Bank predicted Thursday that Japanese integrated circuit
(IC) and paper makers will continue to enjoy a good business
environment in 1996.
     The bank's ''industrial weather forecast'' described the outlook
for IC makers as clear and that of paper makers as fair.
     The company based its forecast on brisk demand for personal
computers and paper for computer handling manuals and merchandise
catalogs.
     The business environment will improve slightly for automobiles,
machine tools and retail industries due to restructuring of their
operations and recovery of consumer spending, the bank said.
     Conditions will worsen for home electrical appliances and
housing industries in view of a continuing production shift overseas
and declining housing starts, it said.

Daiwa's N.Y. branch ex-manager indicted on conspiracy++

NEW YORK, Dec. 27 Kyodo

     A former manager of the New York branch of Japan's Daiwa Bank,
was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on charges of
conspiring to defraud the Federal Reserve Board by allegedly
assisting in a cover-up of 1.1 billion dollars in trading losses.
     The federal indictment against former branch manager Masahiro
Tsuda includes a charge of failure to report a felony.  If convicted,
he faces up to eight years in prison and a fine of 500,000 dollars.
     Tsuda was arrested and first brought up on charges Nov. 2, which
led to an indictment against Daiwa Bank and the closing of its 15
branches in the United States.
     Tsuda was freed on a 500,000 dollar bond and is scheduled to be
arraigned Jan. 4.
     Wednesday's indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in
Manhattan, replaces the original criminal complaint filed by the U.S.
Attorney's Office and further details Tsuda's alleged role in the
conspiracy.
     The charges describe how Tsuda allegedly concealed 1.1 billion
dollars in trading losses incurred by the branch's former executive
vice president, Toshihide Iguchi, through unauthorized trading in
U.S. securities over a 12-year period.
     Iguchi was arrested Sept. 23 and later pleaded guilty to fraud
and embezzlement charges, and is awaiting sentencing.
     The indictment alleges that Tsuda failed to report Iguchi's
crimes to the Fed between July, when he first learned about the
losses, and September.
     Tsuda's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, called the charges ''unwarranted
and unjustified.''
     ''Mr. Tsuda sought to be law abiding...and act consistently with
what his employer and the Japanese Ministry of Finance determined was
the only appropriate course here -- that a thorough investigation of
Iguchi's extraordinary trading loss be conducted before a report was
filed with U.S. regulators,'' Arkin said in a statement.
     According to the indictment, Tsuda met with Iguchi and other
senior managers to discuss ways of further concealing the losses.  It
said Tsuda considered a plan to hide the losses through a Cayman
Islands entity and asked an employee to figure out a way to
repurchase securities that Iguchi had sold so that it would appear
the losses had not occurred in New York.
     Prosecutors allege that Tsuda postponed an internal audit in
late August by ordering Iguchi to take a vacation so that the losses
would not be discovered.  Iguchi did not actually take a vacation but
actually went to Tsuda's apartment to meet with a small group of
managers to review all the records of his unauthorized trading and
reconstruct the trading losses, the indictment claims.
     The indictment alleges that two Daiwa employees repeatedly
warned Tsuda that the bank was required to report the loss to the
Fed but that Tsuda refused, telling them he would take full
responsibility if the matter was discovered.

Ex-Im Bank to extend 24 bil. yen loan to Ukraine+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The Export-Import Bank of Japan signed agreements Thursday to
extend a 24 billion yen loan to the Republic of Ukraine to help
stabilize the country's economy, the government-financed bank said.
     The bank said 18 billion yen will be an ''untied'' loan, which
allows the recipient nation to purchase necessary goods and services
from not only Japan but other countries.
     The remaining 6 billion yen will be used to finance the
country's exports, the bank said.
     The loan is in line with an agreement reached at the Naples
summit of the Group of Seven major industrial nations in July 1994 to
provide Ukraine with a total of 4 billion dollars in loans, the bank
said.  Japan pledged to put up 200 million dollars of the total.

S and P lowers Fuji rating, revises Sakura, IBJ outlooks+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Prolonged concern over Japan's banking system, plagued by bad
loans, led Standard and Poor's on Thursday to lower the debt ratings
of Fuji Bank and revise downward its outlook for the ratings of
Sakura Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).
     S and P put Fuji Bank's senior debt rating at A-minus in light
of ''the length and severity of the problems facing the Japanese
banking sector'' as well as ''the bank's large problem loans,'' the
Japanese arm of the U.S. credit rating agency said.
     The outlook for the long-term rating is negative because the
bank's asset value could face further erosion and it is uncertain
when the nation's banking environment will improve, the agency said.
     Meanwhile, S and P revised its outlook for the senior ratings of
the IBJ and Sakura Bank to ''negative'' from ''stable'' due mainly to
the impact of a planned write-off of their exposure to ailing
mortgage lenders, it said.
     Sakura's long-term debt is currently rated A-minus by the
agency, while the IBJ's has an A-plus rating.

Bank managements looking to freeze salaries next spring++

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The managements of major commercial banks are intending to head
off rises in employee salaries during wage negotiations next spring
in hopes of keeping operating costs down, industry sources said
Friday.
     In addition to the need to stay competitive in the increasingly
globalized financial markets, the industry's unprecented plan to
freeze salaries is spurred by public criticism that salaries at banks
are high in comparison with other industries, the sources said.
     Criticism about the salaries of bank workers arose after the
government decided to use 685 billion yen in taxpayers' money to help
liquidate seven financially strapped housing loan companies.
     As a result of writing off losses stemming from the liquidation
of the mortgage firms, some banks are likely to post unconsolidated
pretax losses for fiscal 1995 ending March next year.
     At the same time, however, net operating profits at the
commercial banks are likely to rise to an all-time high due to
record-low interest rates which have reduced fund-raising costs.
     Labor unions at the banks are expected to strongly oppose the
attempts to freeze salaries.  ''They should first cut the bonuses of
executives,'' one labor union official at a major commercial bank
said.
     The labor unions are nevertheless expected to negotiate for much
smaller wage hikes than in the previous year as consumer prices have
declined.  In 1995, the benchmark Tokyo consumer price index fell for
the first time since 1970, declining 0.3% from the preceding
year.
     During spring negotations this year, the labor unions asked for
a rise of 1.0% and finally settled for a 0.5% increase.

Budget investment plan shows 2nd lowest rise++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government endorsed the fiscal 1996 investment and loan
program Monday, calling for the second lowest rise ever against the
background of weak corporate cash demand and a trend toward limiting
the role of governmental corporations.
     The investment and loan program for fiscal 1996 was approved by
the cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama at an extraordinary
cabinet meeting Monday.  The program will be presented for approval
by the Diet at a regular parliamentary session starting in late
January.
     The government plan earmarks 40,533.7 billion yen for the core
general category of the investment and loan program for the year
beginning April 1, up 0.7% from the initial program for fiscal 1995.
     The figure was revised up 80.4 billion yen from the 40,453.3
billion yen in the Dec. 20 draft program after relevant government
ministries and agencies renegotiated it with the Finance Ministry to
restore their requests.
     Still, the growth represents the second lowest year-on-year
rise since the program started in fiscal 1953, following the 1.2%
fall in fiscal 1985, a Finance Ministry official said.
     The core program expanded 7.7% in fiscal 1994 and 2.1% in the
current fiscal year.
     Under the investment and loan program, often described as a
second state budget, funds raised from state-run postal savings and
insurance systems as well as public pension programs are invested in,
or lent to, government-affiliated corporations.
     The overall investment and loan program -- the core program
plus financial investment operations -- totals 49,124.7 billion yen,
up 1.9% from the initial program for the current fiscal year, which
envisaged a 0.7% growth.
     The increase compares with a draft 0.3% rise.  The upward
revision came mainly because allocations for financial investment
were raised to 8,591 billion yen, up 700 billion yen from the draft
stage.
     The 700 billion yen goes into the new account of a government
corporation managing postal insurance funds to bring the total
allocation for the account to 1.7 trillion yen.
     The portfolio was established in 1992 to invigorate sluggish
share prices.  The government earmarked 2 trillion yen for this
purpose in fiscal 1993, but the figure slid to 1.5 trillion yen
in fiscal 1994 from 1 trillion yen in fiscal 1995.
     ''The account chalked up a turnaround from recent declines
because of current stock market conditions,'' the official said.
     By project, the government earmarks 12,143.3 billion yen in the
core program for housing-related projects, up 1.2%.
     Housing Loan Corp. will receive 10,909.8 billion yen, up 2.6%,
to provide loans for 630,000 home purchases in fiscal 1996 as
envisaged in the government's five-year home construction scheme
beginning next fiscal year.
     The budget for projects related to small businesses falls 12.6%
to 5,506.6 billion yen after a 5.1% growth in fiscal 1995, the
ministry said.
     Allocations to the government-affiliated Small Business Finance
Corp. are down 27.3% to 1.87 trillion yen for the first decline
since fiscal 1986.  The allocation was raised 3.4% in the fiscal
1995 budget.
     The Finance Ministry said the lower allocation resulted from the
downtrend in corporate cash demand.
     But the decline also reflects falling demand for funds from
public corporations, with the fiscal investment and loan program rate
-- at which the government borrows money from postal savings and
other sources -- hovering above the private-sector long-term prime
lending rate.
     To develop social infrastructure to improve daily life, the
government allocates 8.73 trillion yen to local authorities, up 21.5%.
     Of the figure, 450.3 billion yen will go to providing water
services, up 12.6%, 1,495.2 billion yen will be spent on sewage
treatment, a rise of 12.9%, and 213.8 billion yen will be used to
build public housing units, up 26.5%.
     Some government-affiliated corporations have been criticized by
the private sector, which is demanding that the corporations should
do no more than supplement private-sector operations.
     Under these circumstances, Japan Development Bank, whose
operations are to be scaled back, will receive 1,434 billion yen from
the investment and loan program under the ministry draft, down 24.8%
from fiscal 1995.
     The Export-Import Bank of Japan will have its allocation reduced
by 17.1% to 1.07 trillion yen.
     Meanwhile, the government earmarks 402.7 billion yen for Social
Welfare and Medical Service Corp., up 19.4%, to step up loans for
building nursing homes and other facilities for the elderly under
its 10-year ''gold plan'' welfare policy.
     On the transportation front, the government allots 21.3 billion
yen to Kansai International Airport Co., up 153.6%.  Of that amount,
700 million yen will be used to start constructing more runways at
the airport, which serves Osaka and opened in September 1994.
     The government sets aside 1,004.7 billion yen for JNR Settlement
Corp., up 10.4%.
     The corporation is disposing of a 26 trillion yen debt incurred
by the former state-run Japanese National Railways (JNR) by selling
land and shares in the seven private rail companies into which JNR
was split when privatized in 1987.
     In October, the government called off its plan to seek a stock
listing for West Japan Railway Co., one of the seven privatized
railway firms, within the current fiscal year to avoid upsetting the
sluggish equity market.

financier for local public corporations to 10,418 billion yen, up
21.5%, to help improve local government finances and develop

Gov't plans 4,845.5 bil. yen defense budget for FY '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government Monday proposed allocation of 4,845.5 billion
yen for the defense budget in fiscal 1996 starting April 1, allowing
a 2.58% increase over the initial budget for the current fiscal year.
     The year-on-year increase is a sharp rise compared with the
35-year low of 0.855% in the current fiscal 1995 that had an initial
defense budget of 4,723.6 billion yen.
     The rate of the year-on-year increase expanded for the first
time in six years after rises of 0.9% in fiscal 1994, 1.95% in 1993,
3.8% in 1992, 5.45% in 1991 and 6.1% in 1990.
     The increase is largely due to the 6.1% jump, to 1,778.8
billion yen, in payments for equipment bought previously but to be
paid for in fiscal 1996, such as aegis ships and the airborne
warning and control system.
     Other than the due payments, the proposed budget is composed of
2,076 billion yen for personnel expenditures and 990.7 billion yen
for other general expenses.
     Because of the sharp rise in the due payments, the government
has made efforts to restrain the defense budget as much as possible,
a Finance Ministry official said.
     The proposed budget sets aside 835.2 billion yen in fresh
contracts, a major part of which will be paid in fiscal 1997 or
later, to procure hardware such as tanks, fighters and destroyers, a
1.2% rise over contracts for fiscal 1995.
     The sum for such equipment shows its first increase in six
years, but if the effect of the planned rise of the 3% consumption
tax to 5% is excluded, the 1996 figure for such equipment is 820
billion yen, or a year-on-year decrease of 0.6%, the official said.
     The fiscal 1996 hardware procurement contracts include those for
11 F-2 planes -- once called the FSX next-generation support fighter
-- four F-15 fighter interceptor planes, 18 tanks, a destroyer and a
submarine.
     Under the government plan, Japan's host-nation support in fiscal
1996 for U.S. forces stationed in Japan will cost 273.5 billion yen,
a 0.8% increase over the current fiscal budget.
     The sum includes costs to move a U.S. night landing practice
site from the Atsugi base in Kanagawa Prefecture to Iwojima Island in
the Pacific, aside from wages for Japanese employees at U.S. bases
and utility fees for U.S. military facilities.
     The budget plan also consists of 153.9 billion yen in
expenditures for residents around military bases, a 2.9% decrease
over the current fiscal year, such as soundproofing their houses,
85.4 billion yen for training, 6.8 billion yen to build a central
command control system in a new Defense Agency building, 2.7 billion
yen to establish a unified information headquarters, and 201 million
yen for security dialogue and related works with nearby countries.
     The proposal includes 139.8 billion yen in contracts for
research and development of new midrange surface-to-air guided
missiles and rescue flying boats, 440 million yen in contracts to
research the so-called theater missile defense system, and 146.1
billion yen in contracts to improve facilities for housing personnel.
     The planned budget expenditure accounts for 0.968% of Japan's
500.7 trillion yen gross national product (GNP) as estimated by the
government for fiscal 1996.
     The 1996 defense outlays are the first annual defense budget
under the fiscal 1996-2000 Midterm Defense Buildup Plan, which calls
for a total of 25.15 trillion yen in defense expenditures during the
period.

Gov't ministers to discuss 'jusen' issues Tue.+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Government ministers concerned will meet Tuesday to discuss
measures to dispose bad loans on the nation's seven ailing ''jusen''
housing loan companies and disclosure of information related to the
problem, Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka said Monday.
     The government is under fire over its plan to use 685 billion
yen under the fiscal 1996 budget to liquidate the companies, saddled
with huge problem loans during the asset-inflated bubble economy in
the late 1980s.
     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told Monday's meeting of senior
officials from the government and the three ruling parties earlier in
the day his cabinet will try to gain public support for the use of
taxpayers' money, according to Deputy Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki
Sonoda said.
     The cabinet needs to provide various types of information to
the public rather than just making arguments, Sonoda quoted Murayama
as saying.
     Masajuro Shiokawa, chairman of the Executive Council of the
largest ruling coalition member Liberal Democratic Party, asked the
government to set timetables for the bad loan disposal under the
liquidation scheme of the seven ailing home mortgage companies,
announced last week.
     Takanobu Nagai, chairman of the Diet Administration Committee of
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which is led by Murayama, said that
before an ordinary Diet session convenes on Jan. 22, the parliament
will discuss whether to set up a special committee on the housing
loan problem.
     The House of Councillors hopes to discuss the matter on Jan. 17
during a Finance Committee meeting, said Hisamitsu Sugano, chairman
of the upper chamber Diet Administration Committee of the SDP.

Gov't adopts 75.1 tril. yen budget plan for FY '96++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government adopted a 75.1 trillion yen budget for fiscal
1996 on Monday, calling for issuing a record 21.03 trillion yen in
government bonds that will further tighten Japan's already strained
fiscal conditions.
     The draft general account budget for the fiscal year beginning
next April totals 75,104.9 billion yen, up 5.8% from the initial
budget for fiscal 1995.
     The draft budget, adopted at an extraordinary meeting of the
cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in the afternoon, will be
submitted to the ordinary Diet session that starts in late January.
     At a press conference after the meeting, Finance Minister
Masayoshi Takemura said, ''The government has compiled the fiscal
1996 budget, basically giving consideration to the Japanese economy
which remains at a standstill.''
     ''There is a wide gap between expenditures and tax revenues and
how to remove it will be a task for budget compilation in fiscal
1997,'' he said.
     To help shore up Japan's sluggish economy, the budget calls for
relatively high growth of 4.0% in overall expenditures related
to public works projects.  The government will continue income and
residential tax cuts for the third consecutive year.
     Growth in general operating expenditures as a whole, however,
will be limited to 2.4%, the second lowest growth since fiscal
1989.
     General operating expenditures -- general account spending minus
such obligatory costs as national debt-servicing costs and tax grants
to local governments -- are used to cover government policy measures.
     To make up for a huge revenue shortage stemming from a plunge
in tax revenues during the prolonged economic slump, the budget calls
for issuing a record 21,029 billion yen worth of government bonds,
including 11,998 billion yen in deficit-financing bonds, also a
record high.
     Despite budget-streamlining efforts, the 5.8% rise in total
budget size is the biggest in five years.
     This reflects a sharp increase in national debt-servicing costs
and the government's decision to use general account funds for the
planned liquidation of moribund housing loan companies.
     Under the fiscal 1996 budget, the government earmarks 1,145.2
billion yen for official development assistance, a major pillar of
Japan's international contributions.  But this represents the lowest
growth ever at 3.5%.
     The defense budget, the first under Japan's new medium-term
defense guidelines aimed at compact but effective forces, will rise
2.58% to 4,845.5 billion yen, for the first increase of the
growth rate in six years.  The rise stems from increased payments for
defense contracts concluded in the past.
     Social security spending will rise 2.6% to 14,287.9 billion
yen, placing emphasis on measures for the disabled and steps under
the so-called ''Gold Plan'' for the promotion of health and welfare
for senior citizens.
     While increases in many spending items are limited to low
levels, public works-related expenditures will rise 4.0% to 9,719.9
billion yen to help lift the sluggish economy.
     The total includes projects to be implemented with the proceeds
from sales of government-owned shares in Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp.
     The budget earmarks 758.8 billion yen for science and
technology, an exceptionally high growth of 10%, in a bid to promote
restructuring of Japan's economy.
     The budget allocates 685 billion yen to help cover losses
stemming from the liquidation of housing loan companies which have
huge bad loans.  The government calls the allocation an emergency
step to help stabilize the nation's financial system.
     National debt-servicing costs, meanwhile, will rise as much as
23.9% to 16,375.2 billion, partly because the Finance Ministry will
be forced to resume regular allocations from the general account to
the National Debt Consolidation Fund for the first time in four
years.
     The ministry suspended fixed-amount allocations to the special
account, which was created to secure fiscal resources for the
redemption of outstanding government bonds, from fiscal 1993 to
fiscal 1995, in a bid to reduce the apparent growth of budgetary
spending.
     Since a huge amount of government bonds is in the pipeline for
redemption, however, the ministry will disburse 3,479.7 billion yen
to the national debt-servicing allocations.
     Tax grants to local governments will increase 2.9% to 13,603.8
billion yen.
     On the revenue side, meanwhile, fiscal 1996 tax revenues are
estimated at 51,345 billion yen, down 2,386 billion yen from the
estimate in the initial fiscal 1995 budget.
     To bridge the gap between revenues and expenditures, the
government will raise a total of 21,029 billion yen by issuing new
government bonds, up sharply from 12,598 billion yen in the initial
fiscal 1995 budget.
     This will bring the ratio of government bonds to overall
revenue from 17.7% in fiscal 1995 to a 16-year high of 28.0% in
fiscal 1996 on an initial budget basis.
     The outstanding balance of government bonds will come to some
240 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1996, equivalent to as much as
49% of the nation's gross domestic product.

Fiscal reform should not mean tax hikes: Takemura++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said Monday that while it
is necessary to reform Japan's fiscal system, that should not be
immediately associated with the idea of a tax increase.
     ''Revenues and expenditures should be discussed as a package,''
Takemura said at a press conference held after the cabinet of Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama endorsed a draft fiscal 1996 budget.
     ''Fiscal reform needs to be dealt with in wholesale debates from
the standpoints of how the government should function and how the
public-sector economy should relate to people's lives,'' Takemura
said.
     Under the draft fiscal 1996 budget, the government will spend a
total of 75.1 trillion yen in the year beginning April 1, with
general operation expenditures -- the core spending category --
totaling 43.1 trillion yen.
     The budget calls for a third income and residential tax cut in
as many years, a 4% rise in public works spending, and an allocation
of 680 billion yen to help clean up the huge debts amassed by
mortgage lenders.
     ''The government had to compile a budget addressing the economy,
which is still at a precarious juncture after four years of
stagnation,'' Takemura said.
     However, to finance the budget, the government had to decide on
the issuance of deficit-covering bonds totaling 12 trillion yen, of
which 1.9 trillion yen worth will be used for tax cuts and will be
compensated for with a future consumption tax hike.
     Takemura said he hopes to come up with good ways to improve the
current budget formulation system under which the Finance Ministry
sets limits on spending items.
     ''Given the huge discrepancy of more than 10 trillion yen
between revenues and expenditures, it is necessary to review the
ceiling-based system,'' he said.
     On the housing loan fiasco, Takemura conceded there were points
that were ''difficult to understand'' in the process of drawing up a
government scheme to dispose of problem loans using taxpayers' money.
     ''The government failed to map out an overview of the program
before putting the plan under discussion,'' Takemura said.  ''It
needs to disclose as much information as possible to win a final
consensus on the program.''

Hashimoto rates high FY '96 budget for MITI+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     International Trade and Industry Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
said Monday the budget allocated to his ministry for fiscal 1996 was
''satisfactory'' in light of economic conditions.
     Hashimoto said the 9.4 billion yen gain in the budget was a
''fruitful'' result for the ministry.  He made the comments at a news
conference after the government approved the fiscal 1996 budget plan.
     MITI is earmarked 394.7 billion yen, excluding spending for
structural adjustment in the energy sector, in the year starting
April 1996, up from 385.3 billion under the fiscal 1995 budget.
     Hashimoto said he hopes the new budgetary allocation will help
ensure smooth growth in the long term.
     The budget will be put toward four priority areas -- promoting
scientific research and development, boosting information-related
technologies, providing assistance to financially fragile small firms
and taking comprehensive steps for the energy sector, Hashimoto said.
     Hashimoto also said on the day that massive issuances of
deficit-covering bonds was an inevitable step.
     Such a move will pose a problem in the future by shifting the
burden of refunding to future generations, he said.  But a ''powerful
remedy'' is needed now with tax revenues sinking due to the slumping
economy, he said.

Business leaders welcomes FY '96 budget+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The leaders of some Japanese economic and industrial bodies on
Monday welcomed the government's fiscal 1996 draft budget.
     Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the powerful Federation of
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said he ''appreciated'' the
decision to increase allocations for a survey on the relocation of
administrative functions from Tokyo as it reflected the federation's
request.
     Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, said he welcomed appropriations for the development of new
businesses and technologies.
     The structural change of Japanese industry is an urgent task, he
said.
     Meanwhile, Jiro Ushio, chairman of the Japan Association of
Corporate Executives (keizai Doyukai), urged the government to
drastically change the pattern of expenditures and distribution of
funds for public works projects.

Prosecutors reindict 2 key figures in huge loan scandal+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Prosecutors reindicted the former head of the now-defunct Tokyo
Kyowa Credit Association and the sister of detained former Labor
Minister Toshio Yamaguchi on Monday on charges of breach of trust in
connection with a giant loan scandal.
     Harunori Takahashi, 50, and Yoshie Yamaguchi, 60, were indicted
on charges of arranging some 1.9 billion yen in illegal loans from
the failed credit union for Yamaguchi's company.
     The move brought to five the number of indictments against
Takahashi, the central figure in the huge loan scandal that has
rocked political and business circles in Japan over the last year.
     Takahashi and Yamaguchi were earlier indicted for a similar
illicit loan case involving another failed credit union, Anzen Credit
Bank.
     The two have already admitted they arranged the 1.9 billion yen
collateral-free loans from Tokyo Kyowa to a golf course development
firm run by Yamaguchi from June 1994 to December 1994, prosecution
sources said.
     With the new indictment, the total amount of illegal loans
Takahashi is alleged to have arranged from the two credit unions
reaches about 22.1 billion yen, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors
Office said.
     Toshio Yamaguchi, who was arrested Dec. 6, is likely to be
indicted on Wednesday on four charges -- breach of trust,
embezzlement, fraud and perjury, prosecution sources said.
     The detention period for the 55-year-old independent member of
the House of Representatives will expire Wednesday.
     He was arrested on suspicion of breach of trust for having
arranged 2.7 billion yen worth of illegal loans from the two failed
credit unions for a company run by his sister.
     Toshio Yamaguchi will also be charged with embezzling some 180
million yen from a foundation to which he had served as a director,
the sources said.  He allegedly used the money as collateral for
loans to companies run by his relatives, they said.
     He will also be indicted on charges of fraud to the tune of some
170 million yen from a university in Kumamoto Prefecture, southern
Japan, in connection with a failed scheme to build a university in
the United States, they said.
     The politician will also be slapped with charges of perjury for
his statements made to the Diet in June in connection with the loan
scandal, the sources said.
     The Diet filed an accusation of perjury with prosecutors against
Yamaguchi Dec. 15 for giving false testimony before a lower house
committee.
     In the testimony, Yamaguchi denied any involvement in arranging
illegal collateral-free loans from the two failed credit unions.
     Yamaguchi denies he is guilty of breach of trust.
     In a related development, tax authorities have discovered that
three companies run by Yamaguchi's 52-year-old brother Katsuto Nemoto
underreported incomes by at least 420 million yen, tax sources said
Monday.
     The Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau has already instructed the
companies to revise their tax reports, the sources said.

Ministers agree on steps to collect housing loans++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Cabinet ministers agreed Tuesday on steps toward collection of
bad loans held by housing loan companies which are to be liquidated
by using taxpayers' money.
     The ministers agreed to ask the home mortgage companies to
maintain claims against bad loans and to rigorously seek to collect
them.
     They also agreed that the housing loan firms should inform the
finance and justice ministries, prosecutors and police authorities of
problems concerning their bad loans.
     The ministers held the unofficial meeting in response to public
criticism of the government plan endorsed last week to use 685
billion yen from the fiscal 1996 budget to liquidate the mortgage
firms.
     Justice Minister Hiroshi Miyazawa, Finance Minister Masayoshi
Takemura, farm minister Hosei Norota, National Public Safety
Commission Chairman Takashi Fukaya and Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken
Nosaka agreed that the government should do everything possible to
collect the companies' loans, Nosaka said.
     They also agreed that information about the housing loan problem
should be made available to the public, he said.
     Under Tuesday's agreement, the Finance Ministry, in cooperation
with other ministries, will start work on the gathering and
disclosure of information on the housing loan problem, and on ways to
help with the collection of loans, Nosaka said.
     The ministers are likely to meet again on the issue later this
year or early next year, he added.
     The ministers also agreed on measures to improve the functioning
of the Deposit Insurance Corp. and the establishment of a new
loan-collecting vehicle to take over debts and claims of the housing
loan companies.
     The Finance Ministry is to submit a bill to revise related laws
to the next Diet session so that the Deposit Insurance Corp. can set
up a section with enough staff to instruct the new vehicle on the
collection of loans .
     The new vehicle will have a loan-collecting division with strong
enforcement power.  Lawyers and real estate specialists will
participate in its activities.
     Both the Deposit Insurance Corp. and the new vehicle are
expected to keep close contact with Justice Ministry, prosecutors and
police authorities.
     In a related development, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told
reporters he instructed the ministers to cooperate toward fulfilling
the people's expectations.

Jan. fund surplus to shrink on slow public lending++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Tuesday predicted a net fund surplus
in January will shrink below the year-earlier level because of
reduced interest revenue from public-sector lending.
     The net liquidity surplus will amount to 5.11 trillion yen, down
from a 6.22 trillion yen surplus posted a year before, the central
bank said.
     Public-sector loans continue to decrease, as their interest
rates remain higher than those by private financial institutions as a
result of a series of cuts in the central bank's official discount
rate to a record low 0.50% per annum.
     Less lending by public financial organizations like the
governmental Housing Loans Corp. has trimmed interest revenues in the
banking system, the central bank said, expecting the fund shortage to
total 428.0 billion yen in January against a surplus of 70.9 billion
yen a year earlier.

Detained ex-minister made huge bad loans by stock deals+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, facing impending
indictment on charges of four counts of crime, caused huge bad loans
through stock trading on funds withdrawn from a firm affiliated with
a central figure in an aggravated loan scandal, investigation
sources said Tuesday.
     Yamaguchi withdrew as much as 38 billion yen from a nonbank
financial unit belonging to the EIE International group headed by
Harunori Takahashi, former head of the failed Tokyo Kyowa Credit
Association, the sources said.
     The 55-year-old independent member of the House of
Representatives funneled about 90% of the funds into stock
trading, resulting in uncollectable loans totaling some 13 billion
yen.
     The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is expected to
indict Yamaguchi on Wednesday, the day his detention period is set to
expire, on charges of breach of trust, embezzlement, fraud and
perjury.
     Yamaguchi was arrested Dec. 6 on suspicion of breach of trust by
having conspired with Takahashi and his sister, Yoshie Yamaguchi, to
arrange 2.7 billion yen worth of illegal loans from Tokyo Kyowa and
another failed credit union, Anzen Credit Bank, for the sister's
company.
     The amount of loans Yamaguchi withdrew through accounts of eight
companies and two foundations he was affiliated with from the EIE's
financial arm reached a peak of 38 billion yen in 1989, the sources
said.
     Yamaguchi used most of the borrowed funds for stock trading, but
the prices of shares Yamaguchi had invested in fell sharply in tandem
with an overall bearish market.
     To salvage Yamaguchi from the snowballing bad loans, the
financial unit sold part of his stocks it had held as collateral,
succeeding in cutting the outstanding bad loans to about 28 billion
yen by November 1990, the sources said.
     Yamaguchi claims he is not guilty of breach of trust.

Shinozawa vows to tighten surveillance system+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Vice Finance Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa said Thursday the
ministry will proceed with a proposed reform of its inspection and
surveillance system in a bid to prevent illicit financial operations
like the Daiwa Bank scandal.
     ''The Daiwa Bank case taught the ministry a lesson and it will
do its utmost to flesh out measures proposed to make its banking
policy more transparent,'' Shinozawa said at a press conference.
     His comment came after a former manager of the New York branch
of Daiwa Bank was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on
charges of conspiring to conceal huge bond trading losses from U.S.
regulators.
     The ministry's response to the scandal drew strong criticism at
home and abroad over its obscurity.
     It only reported the incident to the U.S. banking authorities
some six weeks after Daiwa Bank notified the ministry of the losses
at the New York branch.
     While declining to comment on the indictment of the former Daiwa
Bank manager, Shinozawa said the ministry will make clear the
relations between its banking administration and inspection
activities, in line with reform measures announced by Finance
Ministry Masayoshi Takemura.
     Takemura announced on a set of measures on Tuesday to strengthen
the ministry's inspection and surveillance system, calling for a
shift in its banking policy to one based on market principles from
the current system of so-called ''administrative guidance,'' which
has been criticized for its lack of transparency.

Nov. tax revenues rise for 1st time in 4 months++

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japan's tax revenues rose from the year-earlier level for the
first time in four months in November, supported by growth in
corporate tax revenues, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
     Overall November revenues totaled 6,804.35 billion yen, up 1.9%,
the ministry said.
     But cumulative revenues for the first eight months of fiscal
1995 that ends next March 31 fell 2.7% to 25,793.37 billion yen,
accounting for only 48.1% of the government's current fiscal 1995
tax revenue target of 53,593 billion yen.
     Under a proposed third supplementary budget which reduces the
tax revenue target by 2,912 billion yen to 50,681 billion yen, the
ratio will come to 50.9%.
     ''Income tax revenues were sluggish, but this was more than
offset by an increase in corporate tax revenues with returns from
companies that closed interim account books at the end of
September,'' a ministry official said.
     Many major Japanese companies settle their interim accounts on
Sept. 30 and annual accounts on March 31.
     ''Compared with results for the year-earlier period, companies
posted relatively favorable earnings growth and this led to the rise
in corporate tax revenues,'' the official said.
     November corporate tax revenues rose 7.6% to 3,142.99 billion
yen, accounting for nearly half of the total revenue in the month,
the ministry said.
     Income tax revenues, however, fell 7.8% and totaled 1,602.82
billion yen, including 1,118.76 billion yen from withheld income
tax, down 6.8%, it said.
     Among other items, liquor tax revenues, mainly from September
sales, dropped 10.1% to 156.34 billion yen in reaction to a
high level a year earlier, the ministry said.
     Revenues from the securities transactions tax advanced 56.2% to
36.76 billion yen as securities transactions became more active
compared with a year before, it said.

Shinozawa's resignation reflects poor year for MOF+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The sudden year-end announcement by Administrative Vice Finance
Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa that he will resign early in the new year
reflects a series of incidents that have shaken the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) in 1995.
     The ministry has come under a storm of criticism over a string
of cases during the year, ranging from the bad loan issue at housing
loan companies and the huge loss cover-up at Daiwa Bank's New York
branch to the involvement of ministry bureaucrats in improper
activities.
     Unusually, much of this criticism has focused on the nature of
the ministry itself, which has always enjoyed the position of king of
the Japanese bureaucratic system.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura on Friday accepted
Shinozawa's offer to resign.  The ministry's top-ranking bureaucrat
will formally quit on Jan. 5 and be replaced by Tadashi Ogawa,
director general of the National Tax Administration Agency.
     Shinozawa said, ''I have decided to step down to let some fresh
air into the ministry with the start of 1996 at a time when the
morale of ministry officials has been shaken by a series of
incidents.''
     Shinozawa stresses he is not quitting to take responsibility for
the ministry's responses to any individual case.
     But observers said he had little choice but to resign to
demonstrate his responsibility as the top bureaucrat.
     Critics said the MOF's usual method of trying to put a lid on
scandals by reshuffling officials would intensify public distrust of
the ministry.
     The MOF's poor public reputation has increased with the
revelation of close relations between some of its officials and
Harunori Takahashi, the central figure in an illicit loan scandal
involving two now-defunct credit unions in Tokyo -- Tokyo Kyowa
Credit Association and Anzen Credit Bank.
     The MOF has also angered the public by its decision to use
taxpayers' money to help liquidate housing loan companies saddled
with huge bad loans, without seeking to pursue the people
responsible.
     The ministry has further come under fire from the United States
for its slow response to the Daiwa Bank case.  The MOF reported the
incident to U.S. regulators only six weeks after Daiwa Bank notified
it of its huge bond trading losses at the New York branch.
     This sparked criticism that the MOF, perceived to have cozy
relations with industry, tried to collaborate with the bank to
conceal the incident.
     Katsuto Uchihashi, a commentator on economic issues, said,
''Shinozawa's resignation does not mean an end to the series of
scandals that took place this year.''
     ''It should be the real start of the ministry's reconstruction
by clarifying its responsibility as an organization,'' he said.
     Uchihashi pointed out that one of the most pressing issues is
how to change the concentration of power on the ministry.
     The MOF currently deals with fiscal issues, while keeping an
eye on the banking and securities industries.  Such a concentration
of power has been often blamed for the ministry's often insalubrious
relations with industry.
     Uchihashi also said that relations between politicians and
bureaucrats should be discussed as part of the ministry's reform
efforts.
     Politicians have to take the leadership in decision making and
stop simply accepting policy measures set by bureaucrats, he said.
     There have been growing calls for Takemura to take
responsibility for the bad loan issue at housing loan companies and
other financial scandals.
     Takemura, however, said he currently has no intention of
resigning.  ''It is my responsibility to proceed with the liquidation
scheme recently mapped out by the ministry for debt-ridden mortgage
loan lenders,'' he said.
     In a bid to fend off mounting criticism of the ministry,
Takemura earlier this week announced a set of measures to strengthen
the ministry's inspection and surveillance system.
     He called for a shift in the ministry's banking policy to a
transparent one based on market principles, saying the current system
based on the so-called ''administrative guidance'' is internationally
unacceptable because it lacks clear objective criteria.
     But many analysts cast doubt on the ministry's ability to give
up behind-the-scenes policy management and adopt a more transparent
profile.
     Given the ministry's way of dealing with the scandals simply by
accepting Shinozawa's resignation, it is doubtful whether the
bureaucrats are even conscious of the MOF's responsibility, they
said.

Teramura quits as adviser to banking group+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Nobuyuki Teramura, former chief of the Finance Ministry's
Banking Bureau, quit the post of adviser to the Federation of
Bankers Associations of Japan Friday, industry sources said.
     Teramura assumed the post of special adviser to the banking
industry group Sept. 1.
     The reason for his retirement is not clear but is apparently due
to the strong public criticism of the Finance Ministry's policy of
using taxpayers' money for liquidation of housing loan companies
saddled with huge nonperforming loans, the sources said.
     Commercial banks which have been asked by the ministry to
shoulder heavy financial burdens for the liquidation are also
harboring resentment against the ministry.
     Teramura was involved in the management of the housing lenders
when he was head of the Finance Ministry's Banking Bureau.
     His resignation was revealed through letters sent to member
banks of the banking federation.

Shinozawa's resignation surprises financial sector+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Financial circles were taken aback Friday by Vice Finance
Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa's offer to resign his post just before
the Diet begins grilling the Finance Ministry over its plan to use
taxpayers' money to help clean up bad loans at ailing Japanese
mortgage lenders.
     Shinozawa, the top Finance Ministry bureaucrat, tendered his
resignation to ''refresh the ministry's personnel and boost its
morale.''  He is widely suspected to have made the decision to take
responsibility for the mortgage debacle and a series of scandals
involving senior ministry officials.
     The news came completely out of the blue at the end of the year,
of all times, a top executive of a major commercial bank said.
     The banking industry had expected the ministry would keep its
battle array intact for the time being, given the prospect of stormy
parliamentary debate on the contentious scheme involving 685 billion
yen from state coffers to help offset a 6.4 trillion yen loss
stemming from the writing off of irrecoverable loans amassed by the
mortgage companies.
     Under the program, creditors of the housing loan firms will
forego irrecoverable loans, with recoverable bad loans and performing
assets transferred to a planned debt collection vehicle.  But the
ministry has yet to work out a way to make up for losses generated
when the vehicle fails to recover such loans.
     Banks which founded the housing lenders harbor animosity toward
the ministry because the program forces them to forgive all their
outstanding loans to the companies to compensate for 3.5 trillion yen
of the 6.4 trillion yen loss on irrecoverable loans.
     ''How could he step down without clarifying bureaucratic
responsibility for the mortgage fiasco?,'' an official at one of the
founder banks fumed, fearing the resignation might now deflect
criticism to the private sector when the Diet convenes early next
year to discuss the matter.
     Meanwhile, some bankers appreciated Shinozawa's decision, saying
it indicates the ministry's intention to grapple with the New Year's
tasks in a fresh environment after losing public confidence both at
home and abroad in 1995, which Shinozawa describes as ''the kind of
year we never want to have again.''
     On top of the mortgage problem, two senior officials were found
earlier this year to have had cozy relations with and received
benefits from people related to the failed Tokyo Kyowa Credit
Association and Anzen Credit Bank that were implicated in illicit
lending.
     Hiroaki Taya, former chief of the Tokyo customs office, was
demoted from the position in March because he had traveled to Hong
Kong on a private jet owned by Harunori Takahashi, former head of
Tokyo Kyowa.  Taya is to retire Sunday.
     Yoshio Nakajima, former head of the Finance Ministry-affiliated
Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, resigned from his post in
July as he had signed a sales deal for imported health drinks with a
business consultant who was close to Tokyo Kyowa's Takahashi, and
pocketed some 60 million yen in cash from another acquaintance.
     On the international front, a bond trading loss scandal at Daiwa
Bank's New York branch pit the ministry against U.S. banking
authorities.
     Toshihide Iguchi, then a bond dealer at the branch, had incurred
losses of 1.1 billion dollars over 11 years through unauthorized
trading.  The ministry infuriated U.S. authorities when it informed
them about the case six weeks after learning of the losses.
     Shinozawa's resignation, however, had little impact on stock
pri final trading day of
the year.  Foreign exchange and other financial markets were also
unaffected.
     ''A reshuffle of top Finance Ministry officials will not make
any change in the overall picture,'' a stock dealer said calmly.
''It will neither spur nor dampen equity prices.''

Grain prices could double by 2010, daily says+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Greater consumption in the developing world could cause
international grain prices to double by 2010 from the 1992 level, a
national daily reported Monday, citing a report by the agriculture
ministry.
     In a front-page story, the Yomiuri Shimbun quoted the report on
the world's food supply-demand outlook as forecasting that prices for
wheat in 2010 could be 2.12 times the level of those in the base year
of 1992 and those for rice could show a 2.05-fold climb.
     The report by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries will be made public at a cabinet meeting Tuesday, the paper
said.
     Japan relies on imports for 70% of its total grain demand.
     Given that household spending is greatly affected by
international grain prices, the Japanese may not be able to satiate
themselves with rich food in the next century, the daily said.
     The ministry's report prepared two scenarios, the paper said.
One of the scenarios envisages growth in grain production slackening
to half the present level in the next decade, while the other allows
for grain yield per hectare remaining unchanged.
     Under the first scenario, international grain prices would rise
steadily, reflecting net growth in consumption in the developing
world due to a rise in population and stronger demand for feed grains.
     This would lift prices for wheat and rice by more than two
times, while maize prices would increase by 1.95 times and soybean
prices by 1.81 times, the daily said.
     Under the second scenario, growth rates for international grain
prices would be limited to 10 to 18% over the period.
     In either case, however, grain imports by developing countries
will expand, mirroring greater consumption due to rises in population
and incomes, the paper said.
     According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
annual growth in the world's per-hectare grain harvest slowed down to
2.1% in the 1980s from 3.1% in the 1960s.
     Annual growth in grain output slackened to 1.8% from 3.6%, the
FAO says.

Gov't calls for keeping food self-sufficiency rate+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The government Tuesday unveiled a policy of keeping
self-sufficiency rates for food at current levels until fiscal 2005.
     The cabinet endorsed the policy, which is intended to stem any
further decline in the food self-sufficiency rates, in a long-term
prospect on demand and production of agricultural products.
     The overall rate should be maintained at 44-46% toward
fiscal 2005 on a caloric basis compared with 46% for fiscal
1992, according to the policy.
     The policy calls for the farm sector to expand productivity in
the coming decade by stepping up infrastructure improvement programs
and technological development.
     It also proposed diversification of farm products and cost-
cutting efforts by means of large-scale farming.
     At Tuesday's press conference, Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Minister Hosei Norota said the policy will help stimulate
incentives for farmers in the future.
     The new prospect said Japan's food self-sufficiency rate would
decline to 41-42% if the current situation is left unattended.
     The policy said the self-sufficiency rate for grain should be
maintained at the current level of 28-29%.
     Rice self-sufficiency target rates in fiscal 2005 are set for
96-97%, almost unchanged from the present rate, while targets are
fixed at 12-15% for wheat and 5% for soybean, both up slightly from
current levels.

'95 commodity futures trading volume hits record high++

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The combined volume of futures trading on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange for Industry in 1995 increased 15% over the previous year
to hit a record high of about 35.12 million contracts, the exchange
said Thursday.
     Rubber futures trading volume surged 58% to 14.28 million
contracts while platinum futures trading climbed 31% to 5.97 million.
     The heavy trading was attributable to wild price fluctuations
caused by unstable foreign exchange rates and bad weather in
rubber-producing areas in Southeast Asia, exchange officials said.
     Another major factor was a rapid influx of operating funds into
the commodities market due to unprecedented low interest rates, they
said.

G-7 to keep dollar strong in '96, dealers say+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The pledge by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries
to promote an ''orderly reversal'' of the dollar's excessive
weakness will probably keep the U.S. currency firm against the yen
in 1996, dealers and economists said.
     In addition, the dollar will be supported by the downward trend
in Japan's current account surplus as well as by increasing
investments in foreign currency-denominated bonds by Japanese
investors, they said.
     They said they expect the U.S. currency to move in a range of
95 yen to 115 yen during next year, compared with 79.75-104.70 yen in
1995, as of Dec. 25.
     ''Cooperation among G-7 nations to keep the dollar from plunging
will continue next year, preventing the dollar from sliding against
the yen,'' said Hirokazu Kawai, chief economist in the investment,
research and strategy division of Nikko Securities Co.
     His expectation stems from a joint statement issued after the
G-7 meeting Oct. 7, Kawai said.
     The statement said the G-7 finance ministers and central bank
governors ''welcomed the orderly reversal in the movements of major
currencies that began following their April meeting.''
     The October G-7 meeting took place against the background of the
dollar's rebound to just above 100 yen, a rise of about 20%
from April when the G-7 nations confirmed their support of the U.S.
currency.
     Therefore, there is little prospect of the dollar falling much
below the 95 yen line, given the possibility of coordinated
dollar-buying interventions by Japan, the United States and Germany,
said Kawai.
     ''The downward trend of Japan's current account surplus is
established and is preventing the U.S. currency from losing much
ground against the yen,'' said Akira Narumi, assistant general
manager of the foreign exchange division of Sakura Bank.
     According to the Ministry of Finance, the surplus in October
plunged 51.8% to 4.31 billion dollars, posting the second
straight month of falls from year-earlier levels.
     The fall is the sharpest since a 59.0% plunge registered
in November 1990.
     Moreover, the surplus during the April-September period
decreased 7.4% from a year before to 58.30 billion dollars,
the fourth consecutive half-year-term decline, the ministry said.
     As a result, the dollar might rise to the 115 yen level sometime
in 1996, exceeding the highest level for 1995 of 104.70 yen, which
was posted Sept. 20, Narumi of Sakura Bank said.
     Japan's investors, especially individuals, are expected to
continue going after higher-yielding foreign bonds, putting selling
pressure on the yen, said Takemi Kaneko, general manager at the
foreign exchange section of Marubeni Corp., a major trading house.
     The Finance Ministry's yen-curbing package adopted Aug. 2,
which eased regulations to promote overseas investment and loans by
Japanese investors, will contribute to the expansion of Japan's
foreign investment, Nikko Securities' Kawai said.
     The dollar's rise against the yen, however, is expected to be
limited, said Toshikimi Kaneki, an economist in the research
department of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.
     ''Fear that the gap between Japanese and U.S. market interest
rates might be reduced in the face of a slowdown in the U.S. economy
will weigh down the dollar's topside,'' Kaneki said.
     Furthermore, the dollar will probably be pressured by U.S.
efforts to balance the budget, which could lead to a decrease in the
number of Treasury bonds issued and thus to a possible reduction of
the rate gap between the two countries, he said.
     Lingering doubts about the planned creation of a common currency
for European Union member countries might continue keeping the dollar
from rising much against the yen or the German mark, Kawai said.
     That is because the persistent doubts may draw investors to the
mark, Europe's safe-haven currency, causing the yen to strengthen
against the dollar at the same time, he said.
     In 1995 in Tokyo, the dollar briefly plunged below the 80 yen
line April 19 to 79.75 yen, the lowest level since the modern
exchange rate system was established in the late 1940s.
     Later, however, a series of concerted dollar-buying
interventions by central banks, in addition to the Japanese
government's pump-priming economic package in September, pushed up
the U.S. currency, sending it to a high for 1995 of 104.70 yen Sept.
20.
     The Bank of Japan's accommodative credit policies, including the
cut in the official discount rate Sept. 8 to a record low of 0.5%
per annum, also contributed to the dollar's recovery to above
the 100 yen line.

Fisherman sentenced to 6.5-year jail term over gun trade+

SHIZUOKA, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Japanese fisherman was sentenced to six and a half years in
jail at the Shizuoka District Court on Monday for masterminding
large-scale gun smuggling from South Africa for supply to crime
syndicates.
     Prosecutors had sought an eight-year prison term.
     Presiding Judge Katsutoshi Suzuki said in his ruling that
Hideaki Soga, 27, of Kagoshima, who worked aboard a tuna trawler,
''had sold almost all the guns, smuggled into Japan on an
unprecedented scale, to members of organized crime, who used the
weapons in crimes.''
     According to the ruling, Soga conspired with Hiroshi Irabu to
load a total of 191 pistols during a port call at Cape Town, South
Africa, and to land the weapons in Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture,
southwest of Tokyo, on Aug. 23, 1991.
     Irabu's trial in connection with the gun smuggling is still
pending at the court.

Auctioned imported rice prices sag to 262 yen per kg+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The wholesale price for two U.S.-grown rice brands dipped to an
average 262 yen per kilogram in this year's second auctions for
imported rice, organized by the Food Agency on Tuesday.
     The two brands are Akitakomachi and Koshihikari.  The two
high-grade brands were originally developed in Japan, but the seed
was exported to the United States to be grown by U.S. farmers for
sale back in Japan.
     The price of 262 yen was about two-thirds the average price the
same brands fetched at the first auction in July.
     Even after their prices are marked up by various middlemen and
distributors, these U.S. brands are expected to be priced at about
the same level as middle-grade domestically grown rice brands -- and
certainly lower than top-quality domestic brands -- when they are
offered on shelves at Japanese retail outlets, agency officials said.
     The lower prices materialized because the initial margin --
which a wholesaler must pay to the agency to win a contract to buy
the rice -- plunged to 150 yen per kg from 292 yen paid to the agency
in the first auction.
     The auctions are held under a special price-setting mechanism
devised by the agency after Japan agreed in 1993 to scrap its ban on
rice imports as a part of compromise arrangements under the Uruguay
Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  At the
time Japan vowed to allow foreign rice a ''minimum access'' of 4% of
the domestic market of 10 million tons a year, starting in 1995.
     The new system allows the Food Agency to buy all the rice
imported by trading houses and to resell it to wholesalers,
effectively preventing distributors from bypassing the agency.
     Under the simultaneous buy and sell (SBS) system, the agency
requires competing pairs of importers and wholesalers to submit two
bids simultaneously, one for the price at which the importer plans to
sell rice to the agency and the second that at which the wholesaler
offers to buy the same rice cargo from the agency.
     The auction mechanism mandates that the agency award contracts
to pairs offering the best profits to the agency through maximization
of the gap between the two bids.
     The agency-devised system allows an importer-wholesaler pair to
offer bids differing by up to 292 yen per kg of rice.
     Now that the final retail prices of the two brands are expected
to drop to levels matching those of middle-grade rice brands as a
result of the latest auction, they are likely to be competitive with
various Japanese brands, industry sources said.
     Japanese wholesalers and retailers who purchased imported rice,
including the two U.S brands, from the agency at the first auction,
suffered sluggish sales because the official markup system forced
their retail prices up, the sources said.
     In view of the development, the agency increased the volume of
imported rice offered for bids at the second auction from 2,800 tons
in the first auction to 10,000 tons.
     Bidders applied to purchase a total of 23,194 tons of imported
rice.  The government allowed the auctioning of a total of 7,894 tons
of imported rices in accordance with its preset mandatory standards
on auction prices.
     As a result, the ratio of the aggregate volume of rice which
bidders applied to buy on the one hand to the volume of actually
auctioned rice on the other came to 2.3 -- a sharp drop from the
previous auction's 9.6, agency officials said.

FY '95 crude steel output to fall below 100 mil. tons+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's crude steel output in fiscal 1995 is projected to fall
below 100 million tons for the first time in two years, the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry said Monday.
     In fiscal 1995, crude steel production is likely to reach 99.24
million tons, down 2.1% from the previous year, because output
in the January-March quarter is expected to fall 9.2% to 23.2
million tons.  Fiscal 1995 ends March 31, 1996.
     According to the ministry, crude steel production is likely to
hit 101.58 million tons in the 1995 calender year.
     While the number of workdays will decline in the January-March
quarter, the ministry said steelmakers will continue to be urged to
adjust inventories, which piled up in the April-September period for
reconstruction of Kobe and the vicinity hard hit by the Jan. 17
earthquake.
     In the January-March quarter, the ministry projects domestic
consumption of steel materials will drop 1.7% to 16.16 million
tons.

Steel wholesaler Hiuka Sangyo applies for bankruptcy+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A steel materials wholesaler under the aegis of world leading
steelmaker Nippon Steel Corp. virtually went bankrupt Thursday, with
debts estimated at 24 billion yen, a credit research agency said.
     Teikoku Databank said Hiuka Sangyo Co., based in Tokyo, applied
to the Tokyo District Court for voluntary bankruptcy.
     The agency said Hiuka Sangyo was established in May 1950 as a
steel materials wholesaler designated by two steelmakers -- Nippon
Steel and Fuji Steel.  Nippon Steel's corporate name was later changed
to Yawata Steel which merged with Fuji Steel into Nippon Steel Corp.
     The company's U.S. subsidiary, Hiuka America Corp., has
suspended operations since three of its executives were arrested
recently on suspicion of fraud for allegedly forging documents to
obtain a 4.5 billion yen loan, the agency said.
     Beside Nippon Steel, the company also had business ties with
other major steelmakers and general trading houses, it said.
     The company's sales amounted to 20.85 billion yen in the peak
year, which ended in January 1991, the agency said.

Nov. supermarket sales fall 0.2% from year earlier+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Sales at supermarkets across Japan in November edged down 0.2%
from a year earlier to 1.3 trillion yen, declining for the second
straight month, an industry group said Monday.
     The Japan Chain Stores Association said that although food sales
were slow, sales of most other items were good.
     ''It still is too early to say that consumer spending has turned
upward,'' an association official said.
     Food sales fell 2.4% from a year earlier to 579.07 billion yen.
     Sales of clothing gained 0.5% to 308.10 billion yen while
household goods sales increased 1.4% to 290.88 billion yen.
     Sales of men's clothes rose 1.1% to 69.695 billion yen but
sales of women's clothes shrank 1.1% to 97.00 billion yen.
     The association said sales of home electrical appliances gained
4.0% to 48.45 billion yen while drugs and cosmetics sales climbed
6.2% to 36.20 billion yen.
     Supermarket store sales turned sluggish for the last two months
after making an upturn in September.

Average Tokyo CPI in '95 down for first time++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The average consumer price index (CPI) in the Tokyo
metropolitan area in 1995 dropped 0.3% from the previous year for
the first time since such an index was introduced in 1970 as a means
to monitor price movements, the Management and Coordination Agency
said Tuesday.
     The agency said this year's overall average CPI for Tokyo's 23
ward area stood at 107.0 against a base of 100 for 1990, compared
with 107.3 registered in 1994.
     In the preceding three years, the overall CPI was up 1.9% in
1992, up 1.2% in 1993 and up 0.7% in 1994, it said.
     Consumer prices in Tokyo in December remained unchanged from
the previous month but were down 0.5% from a year earlier, with the
preliminary CPI standing at 106.7, the agency said.
     ''Consumer prices were extremely stable,'' said an agency
official.
     The year-on-year decrease came for the third straight month,
following a decline of 0.9% in November and 0.9% in October.
     The agency official said the smaller decline in December was
caused by smaller falls in the prices of fresh vegetables, which
fell 14.8% in December from a year earlier compared with November's
26.7% drop.
     Excluding volatile prices for perishable foods, the prices fell
0.1% from the previous month and remained unchanged from a year
before.
     In December, prices for fresh fruit dropped 11.5% from a year
earlier and those for durable consumer goods such as word processors
and videocassette recorders shrank 11.8%.
     On the other hand, prices rose 7.1% in transportation and 2.6%
in school tuitions, according to the agency.
     The agency said overall nationwide consumer prices slipped 0.7%
in November from a year earlier and fell 0.4% from the preceding
month, with the overall index standing at 106.8 against the base of
100 in 1990.
     The year-on-year decline was the largest since February 1987,
the agency said.
     The agency attributed the steep decline mainly to bigger falls
in fresh fruit prices.
     Excluding such perishables, however, the index came to 107.7,
up 0.1% from a year earlier and unchanged from the previous month,
the official said.
     He said he expects the average nationwide CPI for 1995 to show
a decline of about 0.1%, also the first decline since the agency
began announcing such an index in 1970, because Tokyo-area prices
are considered an early indicator of nationwide price trends.

Nov. unemployment rate hits record at 3.4%++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate hit a record high
since 1953 of 3.4% in November, with the recent trend of higher
jobless rates among young workers continuing, the Management and
Coordination Agency said Tuesday.
     The previous official record high rate was 3.2%, registered
first in April and remaining until October, except for May's 3.1%,
as a result of the prolonged slump in the national economy.
     In a separate report released on the same day, the Labor
Ministry said the seasonally adjusted ratio of job offers to job
seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, rose fractionally in
November to 0.63 from the preceding month's 0.61.
     The reporting month's level compared with September's 0.60, the
lowest level since 1986 when the Japanese economy was hit hard by the
sudden appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar.
     However, the November rate means there were still only 63 job
offers for every 100 job seekers.
     The agency and the ministry said Japan's employment situation
remained severe in November and is unlikely to show notable
improvement immediately.
     In the unemployment report, the agency said there were a total
of 2.18 million unemployed people in November, up by 330,000 or
17.8% from a year earlier.
     The unemployment rate for men stood at a record high of 3.4%,
up 0.2 percentage point from the previous month, while that for
women was 3.3%, unchanged.
     An agency official said the unemployment rate climbed to a new
high probably because there were more people resuming job-hunting,
believing that the economy might pick up.
     Corporations, however, especially large ones, were not offering
many jobs, the official said, adding this left more people in the
situation of seeking jobs unsuccessfully at the time of the survey.
     The unemployment rate in the month was also boosted by the fact
that there were more people, particularly among young male workers,
who wanted to change jobs, the official added.
     The agency survey showed that the unemployment rate for male
workers in the 15-24 age bracket stood at 6.3%, up 1.1 point from a
year earlier.  The rate in the 25-34 age bracket was 3.5%, up 1.0
point, while that for the 35-44 age bracket was 2.2%, up 0.5 point.
     On the job seeker-offer ratio, the ministry said the number of
job offers during the month nudged up 0.5% from the previous month
for the second consecutive monthly rise, following a 2.6% increase
in October.
     The number of job seekers dropped by 1.6% from the previous
month, a turnaround from a 0.8% increase in October.
     By industry, job offers increased 7.4% from a year earlier in
the service business sector, 4.4% in the construction industry, and
4.1% in the wholesale, retail and food industries.
     Such offers dropped 4.8% in the manufacturing sector, while
they rose 3.2% in the transportation and telecommunication sector,
the ministry said.
     Behind the surge to a record high 3.4% in the jobless rate for
November lies a sharp increase in unemployment among younger
workers, private-sector analysts said.
     Many graduates face difficulties in finding jobs, affected by
corporate restructuring efforts which have led to a fall in the
hiring of new graduates, they said.
     They also noted a greater number of workers in their 20s are now
out of work because they find it hard to find new hoped-for jobs.
     Masatoshi Moriyama, a researcher at the Sanwa Research Institute
affiliated with Sanwa Bank, observed, ''There's a mismatch between
businesses which are seeking those who are useful immediately and
young workers who have left jobs to hunt for new jobs despite their
inadequate vocational ability.''
     Given persistent restructuring efforts among businesses, the
nation's unemployment rate will remain on a high plateau in the
months ahead, analysts say.
     The ratio of workers in their 20s who left jobs in the first
half of this year increased from a year earlier, according to Labor
Ministry figures.
     That ratio is taken by some analysts as a bright indication of
economic recovery.  They say the burgeoning economic comeback is
prompting young workers to enter the job-changing market.
     But Hiromichi Kinouchi, general manager for management and
planning at the Students' Assistance Association, said the rise in
unemployment among young workers stemmed largely from a drop in
hirings of new graduates and a larger number of workers who left jobs
under stronger restructuring pressure.
     ''Some of them easily left jobs as they are taken care of by
their parents,'' Kinouchi said.
     The higher jobless rate is also accounted for by the nation's
changing industrial structure, analysts said.
     Manufacturing-sector employment is following a downward pace due
to an increasing shift of production from domestic bases to overseas
while employment in the service sector is on the upswing.
     The service industries such as retailers, wholesalers and
restaurants are dominated by low-wage part-timers and moonlighters.
     ''While employment in the service industries is increasing,
their workers tend to leave jobs because of lower wages.  This in
turn results in a higher jobless rate,'' said Moriyama of the Sanwa
Research Institute.

Labor minister calls jobless rate increase temporary+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Labor Minister Shinji Aoki said Tuesday the rise to a record
high 3.4% in the nation's jobless rate for November is a temporary
phenomenon in the current process of economic recovery.
     ''I have little choice but to take a serious view of the
unemployment figure,'' Aoki said at a press conference after a
regular cabinet meeting.
     ''But the jobless rate tends to rise temporarily in the course
of an economic pickup because such recovery encourages some young
workers to seek new jobs,'' he said.
     On the job seeker to offer ratio, Aoki said the rise of 0.5%
in the ratio for the month under review indicates that the
economy is picking up to some extent, although he said the recovery
is not strong enough.

possible to discuss job-security measures.
     The eight million-member Japanese Trade Union Confederation

     In order to avoid an unemployment crisis in Japan, it is
indispensable for the government, corporate management and labor
unions to introduce bold steps to secure employment, it said.

Organized workers hit postwar low of 23.8% in '95+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The ratio of labor union members to employees slid for the 10th
straight year in 1995 to a postwar low of 23.8% as the number of
organized workers fell for the first time in six years, the Labor
Ministry said Tuesday.
     A ministry official attributed the decline chiefly to a shift in
the nation's industrial structure toward service-oriented industries
and a subsequent decline in workers in the manufacturing sector, who
are better organized than those in the services sector.
     The latest rato of organized labor, tallied on statistics made
available as of June 30, was 0.3 percentage point lower than last
year's, the ministry said.
     The number of union members fell by about 85,000 to an estimated
12.61 million, the first decline in six years, with the number of
unions themselves down 835 to 70,839, it said.
     By industry, the number of union members in the manufacturing
sector was the biggest, totaling 3.92 million and accounting for
about one-third of the total union members, the ministry said.
     Union members in the services sector came in second with 1.93
million, followed by those in the transport-telecommunications sector
with 1.62 million, it added.
     Among major labor organizations, the nation's largest, the
Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), saw its membership slide
by 98,000 to 7.72 million, it said.

Winter bonuses up 1.9%, banks, insurers boycott poll+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Winter bonuses paid by leading private- sector companies this
year rose 1.9% over last year to a weighted average of 798,848 yen,
the Labor Ministry said Tuesday.
     The ministry said it was the second straight year of rises in
winter bonuses, showing improvement in corporate business performance
in the wake of restructuring and the downturn of the yen's value.
     The growth rate for last year stood at 0.1%.
     The ministry said the report was based on a poll taken on major
corporations, mostly those listed on stock exchanges, with 291
companies responding.  It has been conducting the survey since 1965.
     Four commercial banks and two insurance companies covered in the
poll continued to boycott the survey, disregarding a request for
cooperation, the ministry said.
     By industry, the ministry said bonuses paid by oil product
distributors and dealers showed the highest growth rate of 8.8% to
762,867 yen, reflecting brisk exports of petrochemical products to
Asian countries.
     In contrast, the construction industry posted a 16.9% fall to
1,253,606 yen due to the protracted real estate market slump, the
ministry said.

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Overtime hours worked in November at Japanese manufacturers
with 30 staff or more picked up from October's level for the first

     Manufacturing workers put in an average 14.0 hours of overtime

     Overtime hours had shrank 0.8% in September and 0.5% in October.
     The figure also represents a 4.5% increase from the same month
a year earlier, compared with a 3.0% rise in October.
     Overtime work hours are widely counted as an indicator of
economic trends.  The growth for the reporting month came in line
with Wednesday's announcement of a 1.3% month-on-month pickup in
industrial output for November.
     Meanwhile, jobs at manufacturers with a workforce of 30 or more
totaled 7.78 million, down 2.3% from a year earlier and the largest
fall since October 1994, when the tally slid by the same margin, the
ministry said.
     Overall industrial employment contracted 0.8% year on year to
23.34 million, the ministry said.
     Service-sector jobs turned up 1.5% to 6.56 million, while
wholesalers, retailers and restaurateurs saw the number of workers
on their payrolls dip 1.0% to 3.55 million.
     Of the 7.78 million manufacturing jobs, 7.84% were part-time
positions, down 0.36 percentage point from November 1994. The
part-time ratio for industries overall stood at 11.81%, up 0.23
point.
     Monthly wages averaged 329,165 yen in the manufacturing sector,
down 1.0% year on year, and came to 296,095 yen overall, up 0.6%,
the ministry said.
     Inflation-adjusted pay gained 1.7% from a year earlier in the
manufacturing industry and rose 1.6% overall, the ministry said.

Labor, management at odds over small business workweek+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Labor and management remain at odds in a government panel
discussing whether to extend a moratorium designed to ease smaller
businesses into a 40-hour workweek set by the Labor Standards Law,
Labor Ministry sources said Thursday.
     The legal workweek was shortened to 40 hours in fiscal 1994.
But the law has allowed smaller businesses, which find it hard to cut
working hours due to labor shortages, to apply a 44-hour workweek on
condition that they shift to a 40-hour week in fiscal 1997.
     In a separate interim measure, minor enterprises in the commerce
sector and three other sectors are entitled to continue with a
46-hour workweek beyond fiscal 1997.
     While the Labor Ministry wants the panel -- the Central Labor
Standards Council -- to file a report by February, neither employers
nor employees are in the mood to climb down.  The report is not
likely to mention big reforms involving labor law revisions, the
sources said.
     Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest of the
three ruling parties, is poised to set up a task force early next
year to study an extension of the moratorium at a request of lobby
groups representing merchants and industrialists.
     The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), meanwhile,
adopted a resolution calling for full implementation of a 40-hour
workweek when they convened earlier this month to boost their morale
for ''spring offensive'' wage negotiations.
     The ministry, which will effectively compile the panel report,
hopes to achieve smaller businesses' transition to a 40-hour workweek
as planned.  ''Our stance is to make an effort to realize what has
been decided under the law,'' said Vice Labor Minister Kunihiko Saito.
     Given the yawning gap between labor and management, however, the
ministry suspects it will be difficult to guide arguments toward
presenting a bill to revise the labor law during the next regular
Diet session early next year, the sources said.

Employment of foreigners with skills on rise+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau approved the entry
into Japan of 6,564 foreigners in 1994 who planned to work in the
country using their skills, up 14 from the previous year, officials
said Thursday.
     The foreigners received permission to work in Japan as language
teachers, interpreters or other technical jobs, the officials said.
     The increase shows that foreigners with certain skills are not
affected by the country's prolonged economic slump, which is
deteriorating the domestic employment condition, they said.
     Of the total, the largest single group was 2,063 from the United
States, followed by 890 from Britain, 710 from Canada and 704 from
China.

Construction works head cases of local gov't corruption+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Some 30% of corruption cases discovered during fiscal 1994
among local government officials were related to public construction
works, a Home Affairs Ministry survey released Friday said.
     A total of 106 cases were discovered in the fiscal year from
April 1 1994 to March 31, 1995, representing a decrease of three from
the previous year, the ministry said.  Of these, 33 involved
construction projects.
     A total of 124 local government heads and officials were
implicated in the cases, down 11 from a year earlier, but the number
of local governments involved in the cases increased by two to 99.
     Of the 106, embezzlement accounted for 52 cases and graft 41.
     The cases included one in which a vice governor of Aichi
Prefecture was arrested in May last year for receiving 20 million yen
from a contractor in exchange for favorable treatment over a public
works project.

Homeless in Japan face hard times due to economy, cold+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Tokyo's homeless face a particularly grim few months now that
the metropolis is in the grip of winter.
     In an underground passageway used by thousands of people daily
near the western exit to Tokyo's busy Shinjuku Station stands a small
makeshift altar.
     It was placed beside a cardboard box whose former occupant, Jiro
Takahashi, 53, a homeless man and sometime poet, died a week ago from
hepatic cirrhosis.
     One of Takahashi's poems ironically became his own epitaph.
     ''Autumn's blossom, the Chinese bellflower has bloomed.
     ''To bloom and fall in underground passageways is a commonplace
in the world of people.''
     These days, Takahashi's colleagues pause to pay their respects
as they pass the altar.
     Sachiyo Ikeda and her group of some 30 volunteers who call
themselves the ''Shinjuku Egg Patrol'' regularly distribute boiled
eggs and other food to the occupants of the area's cardboard boxes.
     ''There are no people here who are homeless solely because they
like it,'' Ikeda said.  ''They all say they are here because they
have to stick with their friends, or because they can learn from the
more experienced ones.''
     The passageway is the future site of a moving walkway the
metropolitan government plans to install, but which homeless people
and welfare groups say is merely a way to get rid of them.
     The metropolitan government says it wants to move the 200 or so
homeless people now using the passageway to facilities it is building
on a reclaimed island on the edge of Tokyo Bay.
     Faced with continued complaints from pedestrians and owners of
shops near the passageway about the foul smell in the area, the
metropolitan government says the moving walkway must be installed and
that it is to assist elderly people.
     Toshiya Sasaki, a pastor with the United Church of Christ in
Japan and a member of a newly formed citizens' group working for the
homeless, said the numbers began to increase in Japan from 1990.
     That was the year when the so-called ''bubble economy'' began to
falter and opportunities for work in the construction industry
decreased.  Hardest hit were those 50 years and more.
     In August, the Tokyo metropolitan government claimed there were
some 3,300 homeless people in the 23 central wards in the metropolis.
     Local administrations and citizens' organizations familiar with
the problems of the homeless say there are an estimated 700 in
Shinjuku, and 200 in the Sanya area, a large concentration of cheap
flophouses for low-wage earners and unemployed people.
     Elsewhere, the homeless are a visible presence in and around
many of the larger stations like Shibuya and Ueno, where they can at
least stay warm and shelter from the elements during the day.
     In Osaka, the largest city in western Japan, the Airin quarter
in Nishinari Ward is currently home to about 150 homeless people
among the estimated 20,000 day workers there.
     There were twice as many homeless there this time a year ago.
     Police say the decline is attributable to increased employment
opportunities due to the recovery effort after the Jan. 17 Great
Hanshin Earthquake which devastated nearby Kobe and surrounding areas.
     But workers at a welfare center in the area say older homeless
and the sick still face the prospect of unemployment.
     Kawasaki which adjoins Tokyo's southern boundary in July
inaugurated a system of coupons which the homeless can exchange for a
daily meal.  The city has as many as 600 homeless.
     But residents near centers where the meals are supplied complain
that the homeless have begun settling in their neighborhoods.
     Sasaki said society's contradictions are encapsulated in the
problem of the homeless.
     ''They are not doing it because they are lazy,'' he said.  ''For
a start, the state and local bodies should adopt policies which give
them work.''

Corporate entertainment spending down 9%+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     In a sobering reminder of the nation's protracted economic
slump, Japanese companies spent less on entertainment expenses in
the year through January 1995 than the previous year for the second
straight year, official figures showed Tuesday.
     Japanese businesses spent an estimated 5,408.7 billion yen for
entertaining customers and business partners in the reporting year,
down 9.0% from a year earlier, the National Tax Administration
Agency reported.
     The agency surveyed tax reports by 61,365 companies nationwide
which closed their books between February 1994 and January 1995,
selected according to capital and business sectors.
     The total number of companies edged up 1.1% to 2.37 million,
but their total revenues fell 5.6% to 1,417.4 trillion yen.
     Corporate entertainment expenses dropped in the year through
January 1994 for the first time since 1961 to 5.95 trillion yen,
after peaking at a record 6.2 trillion yen the previous year.  The
agency started compiling such figures in 1961.
     In the latest year for which the statistics are available,
companies spent an average of 3.82 yen on entertainment for every
1,000 yen in operating profits, down 3.5% from the previous year.
     Companies capitalized at less than 10 million yen shelled out
7.63 yen, while those with capital of 1 billion yen or higher spent
2.28 yen.
     The construction industry topped the list of the most lavish
spenders on entertainment, followed by printing and publishing
enterprises and real estate firms.
     Expenditures on donations also dropped, for the third
consecutive year, by 8.9% to 477 billion yen.
     The most generous spenders were real estate companies, at 70.6
billion yen, followed by chemical producers and construction firms.

Firms pay 36,000 yen a month for transfers+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japanese companies pay on average 36,420 yen a month as a
special allowance to section chiefs who are transferred to local
branches and choose not to take their families with them, a private
research institute said Thursday.
     On top of this allowance, 21% of companies pay such workers a
sum for transportation enabling them to have family reunions twice a
month, and about half pay for such tickets once a month, the
Industrial Labor Research Institute said.
     Four percent of the 215 surveyed companies pay transportation
fees for family reunions only six times a year, according to the
survey.
     Asked why they could not take their family members to the new
locations, 63% of the workers said they did not want their children
to change schools.
     An institute researcher cited the difficulties faced by senior
high school students who accompany their parents to local cities of
finding schools with curricula corresponding to those of their
previous schools and that readily accept students who have not sat
Japan's usual yearly entrance examination.
     Fifty-eight percent of the surveyed workers said their elderly
parents who live with them refused to move to new communities.
     Forty percent replied they did so through reluctance to sell
their homes and buy new ones in local cities, the institute said.
     The companies said on average for transferred workers choosing
not to take their families with them, they give three days off
before they start at the new office.  However, 27% said they do not
give such time off.
     The average special allowance paid to senior managing directors
who are transferred to local offices was 40,275 yen, while that for
managers came to 39,143 yen, the institute said.
     Such allowances for rank-and-file employees came to 32,067 yen
on average, it said.
     Seventy-six percent of the companies said they continue to pay
these special allowances until the assignments come to an end.
Usually such assignments are for a period between two and five years,
the researcher said.
     The survey was conducted in September and October and included
66 large companies whose workforces exceed 1,000.

Yamazaki Baking expected to see lower pretax profit+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Yamazaki Baking Co. is expected to post an 8% fall in
unconsolidated pretax profit to 22 billion yen in the 1995 business
year ending Dec. 31 from the previous year for the second straight
year of decline, a business daily reported Friday.
     The top Japanese baking company's expected profit fall is
attributable to lower sales of bread and other products due to
intensified competition and increased distribution costs, the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun said.
     Overall sales for 1995, including rice products, are estimated
at 563 billion yen, up 3%, the daily said.
     For the 1996 business year, the company is likely to post a
pretax profit of 24 billion yen, up 10% from this year, due to a
streamlined distribution system, it said.
     Sales are also expected to rise 3% to 578 billion yen, the
daily said.

Microbrewers bubbling but local gov'ts still thirsting+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Private microbreweries have been making heady progress in the
market for local beers but local public bodies are having trouble
tapping into schemes to launch small-scale breweries to revitalize
their economies.
     In early December, the first nationwide festival of locally
brewed beer was held at the Tokyo International Fairgrounds.
     More than 15,000 beer fans rushed to the site during the
three-day festival to sample some 11 different beers presented by
local microbreweries in places ranging from Hokkaido to Okinawa
prefectures.
     The government's revision of the Liquor Tax Law last April eased
the license requirements for commercially brewing beer.
     The revision included lowering the minimum beer production
volume from 2,000 kiloliters a year to 60 kl, a measure which has
prompted a growing number of entrepreneurs, beer enthusiast groups
and even local governments to apply for permission to begin producing
local beers on their own.
     After issuing the first licenses to a Japanese sake maker in
Niigata Prefecture and a business group in Hokkaido in December last
year, the National Tax Administration Agency has granted 18 such
licenses to local breweries and provisional licenses to another six
within the first year.
     ''Private microbrewers which have started operations so far are
doing well in the business,'' said Tomoyasu Ishikawa, an organizer of
the first Tokyo local beer festival.
     ''The variety of tastes in such beer is one of the reasons for
its popularity.  Major beer brewers sell many brands that have quite
similar taste but with different labels,'' said Ishikawa, also an
official of Japan Travel Bureau's special team designated to support
private microbreweries.
     ''I think local beers will take root in the country in the
future, just like 'jizake' (locally brewed Japanese sake),'' Ishikawa
said.
     ''The boom in local beers is expected to continue for a while,
and the number of private microbrewers will grow to about 50 by the
end of next year and to about 100 within the next three years,'' said
Motoki Takahashi, an official at the microbrewery public relations
section of Sapporo Breweries Ltd.
     The nation's four giant breweries are all helping local
microbreweries launch their new businesses.
     Sapporo Breweries, Japan's third ranking brewer, has set up the
section to provide local makers with know-how on beer brewing and
beer hall management.
     ''We expect the local beers to stimulate the whole domestic beer
market, which has an annual production of 7 million kl and has
recently seen a slowdown in growth,'' he said.
     Kojiro Hagi at the Promotion Conference of Brewery, Community
and Package Proposal, a business group consisting of eight companies
including Itochu Corp., a giant trading house, established to offer
assistance to local public bodies, is taking a brighter view of the
future of microbreweries.
     ''In the United States, where local beers are quite popular,
such beer occupies about a 1% share of the overall beer market.
Supposing local beers grab the same share in Japan, and taking into
account the break-even point for microbrewers, there could be some
200 to 300 (such breweries) within five years,'' Hagi said.
     In contrast with the solid start by private microbrewers, local
public bodies are facing difficulties getting into the business.
     ''Though many local governments have a keen interest in beer
brewing, not even one has applied for a license,'' Hagi said.
     One of the major obstacles public entities face is the
difficulty of securing a consensus within an assembly to break into
the business, Hagi explained.
     ''A business plan often develops into a political issue in a
local assembly and gets scrapped in the end,'' said Hagi, citing a
case in the town of Kubokawa, Kochi Prefecture, where the local
assembly voted down a 376 million yen brewery construction plan
proposed by the town last March.
     The city of Sanda, in Hyogo Prefecture, is another typical
example.
     As Sanda is the birthplace of Komin Kawamoto, a Japanese scholar
of Dutch studies who introduced beer during the Edo period in the
19th century, city authorities had planned to set up a semiprivate
brewery and produce an original beer to attract more tourists.
     The plan, however, is still pending and the prospects for
launching the business have lost a lot of fizz.
     ''Concern over profitability prevented the local community from
coming to a consensus.  It is difficult for the city to pour tax
revenues into a business for which profits are uncertain,'' said an
official at Sanda city hall.
     ''The rejection by Kubokawa's local assembly also affected our
decision to suspend the plan,'' he added.
     The official said the central government should take some
measures, such as a liquor tax cut, to help local public entities
trying to launch breweries to stimulate local economies.
     Hagi's group is currently providing consulting services to five
local governments still hoping to tap into the beer business.
     Hagi said, however, that it would be the middle of next year at
the earliest before any local government-affiliated microbrewery
tries its hand in the market.

Budget holds ODA spending to record low 3.5% growth+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government Monday approved a 1,145.2 billion yen budget for
foreign aid in fiscal 1996, with its growth restricted to a record
low of 3.5%.
     The rate of growth is the lowest since the government started
allocating budgets for foreign aid or official development
assistance (ODA) in 1976.  The previous low was the 4.0% increase
allowed in the current fiscal year ending March 31.
     It is the third consecutive year since fiscal 1994 for the
growth of the ODA element in the national budget to hit an all-time
low.
     The low rate of increase in the overseas aid budget is largely
attributable to the nation's severe fiscal condition and the need for
the growth of the overall budget to be curbed, government officials
say.
     The cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama gave its stamp
of approval to the ODA outlay, contained in the overall general
account budget for the next fiscal year.  The overall budget will be
submitted to a regular parliamentary session expected to open Jan. 22.
     The proposed ODA spending makes it look likely that Japan will
not achieve its fifth medium-term target of disbursing 70-75 billion
dollars in aid to the developing world between 1993 and 1997.
     Japan remained the world's top foreign aid donor in terms of
total amount for the fourth consecutive year in 1994, disbursing
13.24 billion dollars.  The United States ranked second with 9.85
billion dollars, followed by France with 8.45 billion dollars.
     In its budgetary request for fiscal 1996, the Foreign Ministry,
along with other government ministries and agencies, sought a 7.3%
rise in ODA spending, arguing that a high growth rate is necessary
to accomplish the five-year target.
     The government paid out 1.1 billion dollars in foreign aid in
1993 and 1.3 billion dollars in 1994, a slower pace of disbursement
than hoped for, according to Foreign Ministry officials.
     In the breakdown of the next fiscal year's ODA spending, the
government set aside 277.3 billion yen for bilateral grant aid, up
1.8% over the current fiscal year.
     Of the sum, the budget for small-scale ''grassroots''
grant-in-aid amounted to 4.5 billion yen, up 50.0%, in view of the
need to meet a wide variety of local demands and to promote
cooperation with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
     The government also set aside 1.5 billion yen for fresh
emergency grant aid projects to help rehabilitate war-devastated
areas such as former Yugoslavia and some African countries.
     The ODA budget calls for a 5.7% rise to 348.5 billion yen in
bilateral technical cooperation funds.
     Such funds will be used for, among other things, inviting and
training students, engineers and researchers from developing
countries.
     As part of technical assistance, 1 billion yen is set aside for
subsidies to NGOs, up 31.6% from the initial budget for the current
fiscal year.
     The ODA budget recommends that low-interest yen loans, a key
component of Japan's ODA program, be increased 2.1% to 390.7 billion
yen.
     The proposal also included 76.3 million yen for new programs to
tackle global issues as part of the ''common agenda'' of Japan and
the U.S.
     The government also proposed 8.6 billion yen, up 5.0%, for the
''Peace, Friendship and Exchange Initiative'' to promote exchanges
between Japan and its Asian neighbors.
     The 10-year, 100 billion yen project was started in the current
fiscal year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World
War II and express the nation's remorse for its wrongdoing before and
during the war.
     The government allocated 2 million dollars worth of assistance
to women in developing countries, up 100%, and 390 million yen for
programs of the Foreign Ministry-affiliated Japan International
Cooperation Agency to tackle population problems and AIDS, up 66.6%.
     The budget proposal also calls for 4.1 million dollars for U.N.
efforts to expand women's roles in society, up 96.2%, 6.7 million
dollars for U.N. efforts to control drugs, up 11.7%, and 1.2 million
dollars to help the United Nations protect human rights, up 9.1%.

Cambodian resident in Japan gets award for education aid+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Cambodian resident in Japan has been given an award by King
Norodom Sihanouk for his contribution to reconstructing the
education system in Cambodia, wrecked during the 1975-1979 Khmer
Rouge communist regime of Pol Pot, his Japanese supporters said
Monday.
     Kong Vorn, 58, of Yokohama, received a first class medal for
national construction earlier this month.
     Kong Vorn had filed news reports for Kyodo News Service from
Phnom Penh until the last moment the Cambodian capital was taken over
by the Khmer Rouge on April 17, 1975.
     Although he was forced to work in rural area by the Khmer Rouge,
he managed to escape from so-called ''killing field'' to his home
town in Prey Veng Province on Cambodian-Vietnam border and hid there
until the Vietnamese invasion and installation of an anti-Pol Pot
rebel communist government in 1979.
     Kong Vorn, who survived Pol Pot's liquidation of ''educated
people,'' came to Japan in 1981 as an immigrant.  He settled in
Yokohama and has been working at a Japanese company since then.
     In 1990 when he temporarily returned to Cambodia, he was shocked
to observe the desperate state of education in his home country.
     He organized the ''Cambodian Education Assistance Fund'' in 1993
and launched a fund-raising campaign for the reconstruction of
education, his supporters said.
     The fund so far has financed the building of two junior high
schools and an elementary school in Prey Veng Province, and has also
donated more than 100,000 U.S. dollars for school projects.

UNHCR pondering special fund for Rwandan refugees+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is considering
setting up a special fund for Rwandan refugees whose houses became
in need of repairs while they were away, its chief said Monday.
     Sadako Ogata, the high commissioner of the U.N. body, revealed
the planned 30 million dollar fund at a meeting with Foreign Minister
Yohei Kono, a Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
     The fund, to be launched within the UNHCR, will appeal to the
international community for contributions and help for repairing
dilapidated houses of Rwandan refugees.
     Ogata, a Japanese national, is back in Japan for a winter
vacation.
     She also expressed appreciation for Kono's pledge earlier this
month of some 20 million dollars in humanitarian aid for refugees in
the war-torn former Yugoslavia, the official said.

Korea: Firms Select 9,044 Capital Goods Related Items for Localization

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Conglomerates Discuss Import Cutbacks With FKI

The 30 largest business groups (chaebol) and other large business
enterprises reportedly have decided to go ahead with a plan to
localize capital goods-related items.

The decision came at a meeting of the chairman and vice-chairmen of
the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), one of the largest
businessmen's association in Korea, on September 18.

Through repeated consultations and readjustments among business
circles and by the goods office of the federation, 78 subsidiary firms
of 24 business groups have selected a total of 9,044 capital
goods-related items for localization schedules.

Of the total items, components topped the list with 8,562, followed by
machinery and equipment with 373 and advanced raw materials with 109,
sources at the federation said.

If the localization schedules are carried out successfully, import
substitution would reach 8 trillion won by 2000, along with huge
tangible and intangible indirect effects, the sources predicted.

Under the implementation program worked out by the federation, the
localization projects are estimated to cost about 2.8 trillion won, of
which 1.5 trillion won will be covered with internal funds and the
rest with borrowings from banks and rights offerings, the sources
explained.

To help raise sufficient funds by private enterprises, the government
needs to allow private enterprises to induce foreign cash loans, the
sources said.

Moreover, the business community is calling on the government to
extend varied financial supporting measures and to ease its
restrictions in a bid to help facilitate localization projects of
private enterprises, the sources disclosed.

Despite worsening economic situations at home, largest business groups
and private enterprises are bent on localizing capital goods-related
items, the sources said.

For instance, the Samsung business group plans to pour 500 billion won
by 2000 into localization of eight items, including laser processing
devices and automatic equipment and systems.  If these items are
localized, the group would be able to conserve about 1.16 trillion won
between 1996 and 2000 by replacing imports, group sources said.

The Hyundai business group intends to develop 6,521 items, including
turbo chargers for diesel engines and knock-sensors for passenger
cars. For localization projects, the group will invest 660 billion won
for the next five years, and it wants to conserve about 3.9 billion
won by replacing imports.

The LG business group reportedly is trying to develop 73 items with
its investment reaching 23.4 billion won through 2000 to attain import
substitution totaling about 300 billion won.

The Daewoo business group hopes to undertake 10 research themes, with
its investments in the heavy industries sector reaching 60 billion
won, those in the automobile sector amounting to 103 billion won and
those in the communications sector with 34 billion won, all by 2000.

The Sunkyong group plans to develop 68 items, including 33 quality-
and function-improvement items, cooling towers, pressure gauges and
the like.

The Ssangyong group is expected to develop 65 items with a total
investment of 258.6 billion won in collaboration with its
subcontractor firms.

The Kia group will undertake research and development of 1,321
research themes by 2001, such as those concerning automatic
transmission gears, with a total investment of 623 billion won,
including 44.3 billion won in its own fund.   If these items are
developed, the group would be able to conserve about 700 billion won
by replacing imports.

POSCO (Pohang Iron & Steel Co.) reportedly is trying to develop 661
items, including those related to the manufacture of refractory
bricks, rolls and machinery components by 2000, with a total
investment of 52.3 billion won.

The Hanjin group is pushing ahead with a plan to develop 14 items,
including key items for shipbuilding and rolling stocks, with a total
investment of 8.4 billion won.

The Hanwha group is moving to develop six items, including hub units
and bearings, by 1998 with a total investment of 76 billion won, in
collaboration of its subcontractor firms.

Bank of Korea Reports Potential Growth Rate Drops to 6% Range

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Potential rate of growth has dipped to the six-percent level, sources
at the Bank of Korea said.

The central bank announced that potential rate of growth was 6.8
percent for three consecutive quarters from the fourth quarter of 1995
and the second quarter of 1996.

Potential rate of growth was 7.7-8.4 percent between 1980 and 1989,
7.2-7.8 percent between 1990 and 1993, and 7.1-7.2 percent between
1994 and the second quarter of 1995, all maintaining a level of more
than seven percent.

This was the first time that the potential rate of growth dropped to
the six-percent level, sources at the central bank said.

Consequently, it is inevitable for the government to readjust the
foundation for macroeconomic management such as growth, prices and
international balance-of-payments position, the sources said.

The declining trends of the potential rate of growth were ascribed
mainly to the diminishing contribution ratios of capital and labor to
the economic growth deriving from the slow growth rate of fixed
investment and slowdowns in the increase rate of the economically
active population, the sources analyzed.

The central bank's prediction for this year's growth rate is set at
7.2 percent, while the government forecast that the year's growth rate
will hover around 7.0 percent.

This indicates that the year's real growth would slightly surpass the
year's potential rate of growth, the sources explained.

The estimate results of the central bank showed that the potential
rate of growth between 1994 and the second quarter of 1996 was 6.9-7.1
percent.

In view of growing economic scales, the potential rate of growth will
slow gradually, the sources predicted.

As the general view that the business activities peaked in October of
1995, the central bank made its prediction on the potential rate of
growth beginning the fourth quarter of 1995, the sources said.

Amid such declining trends of the potential rate of growth, any
government's overheated business prop-up measures may bring about
adverse effects such as price hikes, the sources said.

Korea: MOTIE Asks for Lower Tariff Rates on Some Imports

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

The Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy has asked the Ministry of
Finance and Economy to apply lower import tariff rates for crude oil
and 10 other items in a bid to help exporters strengthen their
competitiveness.

The ministry calls for applying zero-percent tariff rates for three
items--central processing units for computer, raw wool and artificial
corundum--instead of the current 2-8 percent rates, sources at the
ministry said.

The ministry also recommended that the import quota tariff rate on
crude oil should be lowered from the current 5 percent to 3 percent,
for all crude oil imports during the second half of this year, the
sources said.

For the remaining six items, the ministry reportedly is asking that
the current tariff rates should be lowered to 2-4 percent levels, the
sources said.

Korea: MFE Works Out Guidelines for Commercial Loans

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

All small enterprises, including those engaged in business lines other
than manufacturing, will be allowed to induce commercial loans for the
import of plants and equipment, beginning in October this year.

At the same time, all private enterprises, small or large, may be
allowed to introduce foreign loans only for early repayment of foreign
loans they have already obtained, without limits, also beginning in
October this year.

Beginning in January next year, private enterprises participating in
the government-initiated projects such as huge infrastructure projects
to be financed with private capital will be permitted to induce cash
loans of up to $100 million per year for the projects only.

To this effect, a draft revision bill to the guideline for approvals
of commercial loan inducement, worked out by the Ministry of Finance
and Economy, will be put into force step by step, sources at the
ministry said.

Under the draft revision bill, foreign-invested firms which have
equity ownership of more than 50 percent will be allowed to induce
loans for the import of plants and equipment within the framework of
their invested amount here, effective from next year, the sources
said.

As for large enterprises, the introduction of commercial loans will be
allowed only for those big businesses engaged in the high-tech field
in principle, and amounts have yet to be fixed, which will be based on
the foreign exchange market situations during the first quarter of
1997, the sources said.

Until recently, only small enterprises engaged in the manufacturing
industry have been permitted to induce loans for the import of plants
and equipment.

From October this year, however, gas, communications and all other
business lines will be added to the permission list, and no annual
limits would be set if small firms comply with necessary terms and
conditions set by the government for the introduction of loans, the
sources said.

Private enterprises participating in huge infrastructure projects (the
first-grade facility projects such as roads, harbors, airports, etc.)
each involving more than 1 trillion won will be allowed to induce cash
loans each of up to 20 percent of the annual net project cost per
project or up to $100 million, for the projects only, the sources
added.

Korea: Financial Support for Industrial Estates to Greatly Expand

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

The government's financial support for industrial estates in
provincial areas will be drastically expanded next year, sources at
the Ministry of Construction and Transportation said.

Beginning in 1997, the government will finance construction of roads
and water-supply systems leading to industrial estates each covering
more than 300,000 pyong (one pyong equals 3.3 square meters) in
provincial districts, the sources said.

At the same time, the loomable amount for the formation of an
industrial estate each covering less than 300,000 pyong in provincial
areas will also be expanded next year far more than this year's level,
the sources explained.

In 1997, a total of 42.5 billion won in the state budget will be
allocated for construction of roads leading to nine industrial estates
in provincial areas, including Chonan, Pyongdong and Naju, the sources
said.

The lending amount for industrial estates each covering less than
300,000 pyong in provincial districts will increase by 20 billion won
to 70 billion won next year, and the loans will be repayable over 10
years in installments after a grace period of five years at an annual
interest rate of 5 percent, the sources said.

These draft budget plans, worked out by the ministry, will be
submitted to the forthcoming National Assembly session after further
consultations with the pertinent ministries, the sources added.

Korea: Five Largest Groups Sell Significantly More Than Others

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

The gap between the nation's top five largest business groups and the
remaining 25 other large business groups reportedly is widening
steadily in terms of turnover.

In the nation's 30 largest business groups, turnover of the top five
business groups showed a whopping increase of 1.6 times over those of
the remaining 25 other business groups in 1994.

This indicates that the top five groups' concentration of economic power
has become more involved, an analysis report of the Korea Development
Institute disclosed.

The share of the 30 largest business groups in the nation's overall
turnover of the manufacturing and mining sector was 39.6 percent in
1994, the report showed.

The share was 34.1 percent in 1977, surpassed the 40-percent level during the
1982-1985 period, dipped to the 35-percent level during the 1987-1989
period and began rising again sharply at the outset of the 1990s, it
said.

In particular, the share of the top five  business groups has become
higher, thus widening the gap between the top-ranking groups and
others.

The share of the top five groups in the nation's overall
manufacturing-mining turnovers in 1977 was 15.7 percent, slightly
lower than 18.4 percent of the 25 other large business groups.

In 1994, the manufacturing-mining share of the top five groups stood
at 24.6 percent, greatly surpassing 15.0 percent of the 25 other
business groups.

The ratio of the top five groups' turnover to overall turnover of the 25
other groups was 22.6 against 17.8 in 1983, and the ratio changed to
21.9 against 14.1 in 1988 and 23.4 against 15.4 in 1991.

This means that the nation's economic power has been heavily
concentrated on the top five business groups, sources at the institute
said.

As a result, the gap between the top five groups' turnover and overall
turnover of the 25 other business groups was 85 percent in 1977, 1.2
times in 1983, 1.5 times in 1991 and 1.6 times in 1994.

In the overall turnover of the 30 largest business groups, the share
of the top five business groups' turnover rose from 46 percent in
1977 to 55.5 percent in 1982 and 62.1 percent in 1994, thus
symbolizing the deepening monopolistic trends of the top five business
groups, the sources said.

Korea: Farm Products Imports Rise by 21% for Several Months

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Imports of farm products in the first seven months of this year
totaled $3.86 billion, up 20.8 percent from a year earlier, sources at
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said.

Imports of farm products from the United States have been increasing
sharply, largely because of the government's import opening policy of
farm products.

Of the seven-month import total, imports from the United States
amounted to $1.76 billion, up 24.7 percent from a year before, taking
the lion's share of 44.7 percent in the seven-month imports, the
sources said.

During the seven-month period, imports of corn from the United States
reached $99.7 million, up 35.5 percent from a year ago, those of
potatoes from the United States showed a rise of 59.6 percent over a
year before, those of grapes rose by 89.6 percent, those of cigarettes
by 44.9 percent, those of tomatoes by 77.4 percent and those of
chocolate by 44.8 percent, the sources said.

Imports of farm products from China during the seven-month period
stood at $309.7 million, up only 13.3 percent from a year earlier, the
sources said.

Korea: Gov't Gives Port Constr. Firms Priority on Auxiliary Projects

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Private enterprises taking part in private capital-financed new port
construction projects will have priority rights to undertake auxiliary
projects, including construction of a breakwater, dredging and others
to be funded by the government, on a negotiated contract basis.

To help facilitate new port construction projects, a set of various
supporting measures will be sought for local autonomous establishments
and organizations, sources at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and
Fisheries said.

Local residents who will lose fishing grounds due to construction of
new ports will be employed by newly created business lines there on a
priority basis, the sources said.

To this effect, a draft bill governing the promotion of new port
construction, worked out by the ministry, will be submitted to the
forthcoming National Assembly session in October after further
consultations with other government ministries, the sources said.

Under the draft bill, various approval and licensing procedures will
be drastically simplified, the sources said.

At the same time, a promotion council for new port construction,
headed by the deputy premier-finance and economy minister, will be
formed with the heads of provincial governments and local
establishments to deal with basic issues such as designation of
potential areas for new ports, key policy directives, fund supply
programs and the like, the sources said.

If so designated, construction of new ports will benefit from
supporting measures stipulated under the draft bill, and once the
draft bill passes through the National Assembly session, new steps
will be taken for designation of new ports, the sources added.

Korea: Life Insurers Asset Management Yields Drop to 10.7%

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

FINANCE

Life insurance companies' yield on asset management has been dropping
in recent months, affected by the continued bearishness of the local
stock market.

According to life insurance industry sources, for the four month
period from April to July, the nation's 33 life insurers' average
yield on asset management declined to 10.7 percent, a drop of 0.4
percentage point from the corresponding period of 11.1 percent.

In particular, six top life insurers -- Je Il, Samsung, Heungkuk,
Kyobo and Dongah -- saw their combined yield on asset management
scaled back to 10.7 percent during the period, down 0.5 percentage
point from a year earlier.

In contrast, newly established underwriters including Daishin
witnessed a rise in their combined yield on asset management by 0.3
percentage point to 10.7 percent during the April-July period,
outperforming existing larger ones in risky asset management.

Of the big three life insurers, Samsung Life Insurance ranked first on
the yield list for asset management with 11.1 percent involving 858
billion won.

Second was Kyobo Life Insurance with a yield of 11.0 percent, a drop
of 0.6 percentage point from 11.6 percent a year earlier ago. Kyobo
racked up 501.5 billion won in income from asset management.

Korea Life Insurance came in third with 10.5 percent involving 326.8
billion won.

Korea: Kookmin Bank Issues DRs Overseas

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

BANKING

Kookmin Bank became the first Korean financial institution to issue
depository receipts (DRs) abroad.

The bank said that it issued and listed $300 million worth of DRs in
London on September 25. Its DRs was sold to foreign investors from
Europe, the US and Asia.

Kookmin Bank will convert the $300 million into won currency in early
October, and will loan the proceeds to small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs).

Meanwhile, a source at the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) said
that six other banks -- Korea Long-Term Credit, Hana, Boram, Cho Hung,
Korea Commercial and Hanil -- are planning to float overseas DRs.

Bank of Korea Reports Bank Lending-Deposit Spreads Increase

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

BANKING

Local banks are expanding lending spreads by raising lending rates
much more than deposit rates, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said.

In a survey on the nation's 30 commercial banks' weighted average
interest rates conducted in July, the central bank said that their
average lending spreads edged up to 2.39 percent, an increase of 0.11
percentage points from the previous month's 2.28 percent.

The reason for this is that commercial banks' average lending rate
surged 0.15 percentage point to annual 11.45 percent in July from the
11.30 percent a month earlier. In contrast, average deposit rates rose
by merely 0.04 percentage point to 9.06 percent from 9.02 percent
during the cited period.

A closer look at the deposit rates by each instrument shows that only
those for time & installment deposits with maturity of three to four
years inched up to 10.57 percent in July from 10.42 percent in June.
Those for free savings deposits rather dropped to 5.67 percent from
5.90 percent, and those for time deposits with maturity of one to two
years skidded to 9.83 percent from 9.85 percent.

When it comes to lending rates, those for overdraft loans rose to
16.13 percent from 14.70 percent on an annual basis during the period.
And those for household loans also edged up to 12.31 percent from
12.17 percent. However those for corporate loans were lowered to 10.85
percent from 11.15 percent.

Samsung Electronics Floats $150 Million in CBs in London

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

FINANCE

Samsung Electronics Co. (SEC) successfully floated $150 million worth
of overseas convertible bonds (CBs) in London.

The nation's No.1 semiconductor manufacturer said that it had a
signing ceremony to issue $150 million worth of CBs in London on
September 20 with Samsung Securities Co. and SBC Warburg acting as
managing underwriters.

The CBs carry a coupon rate of 0.25 percent, and yield to put (YTP) of
5.8 percent.

Conversion premium was fixed at 25 percent. Given that most overseas
depository receipts (DRs) traded in the international markets have a
premium of 10 to 15 percent, SEC CBs' conversion premium is offered
under more favorable conditions.

Korea: Aug. Auto Sales Rise Only 1.8% Due to Sluggish Economy

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Domestic auto sales edged up a mere 1.8 percent to 121,278 units in
August over last August, due to the stagnant economy. Daewoo Motor
enjoyed the highest sales growth of 14.2 percent to 21,872 units,
while Kia Motors saw its sales fall 8.4 percent to 31,374 units.
Hyundai Motor sold the most with 58,151 units.

Hyundai's Avante was the best selling car. Accent leaped to the third
position from seventh in July. Sales of Kia's Pride reached
2,576 units, exceeding sales of Avella. Elan, Kia's sports coupe,
only recorded one sale.

Ssangyong's jeep-type utility, Korando, turned in a fine performance
with sales of 543 units, helping Ssangyong to recover the second slot
in the jeep-type utility market with total sales of 1,850.  Meanwhile,
Hyundai Precision Ind.   suffered a set-back from 4,100 units in July
to 2,578 units in August, hurt by a labor strike.

President Indicates Shift in Policy Toward North 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Employing the strongest rhetoric yet, President Kim Young-sam said 
yesterday South Korea will ``reconsider'' its policy toward North 
Korea in wake of the North's infiltration of armed commandos into 
the South.  

      Kim, meeting a group of Japanese political editors at Chong Wa Dae, 
did not go into details of what steps his government will be taking, 
but gave a clear indication of a shift to a hardline stance against 
the North.  

      ``What do you think would have happened if the same highly-trained 
and armed special commandos had infiltrated Japan or the United 
States,'' Kim was quoted as saying by presidential spokesman Yoon 
Yeo-joon.  

      ``I think that in that case, both Japan and the United States would 
have gone to war with the country which sent the guerrillas,'' he 
said.  

      Kim went on to say that if the United States had been put into the 
same situation, it might have already launched a military attack and 
wiped out the provoking nation.  

      Presidential officials said Kim's remarks should be interpreted as 
underscoring the gravity of the North Korean infiltration case.  

      President Kim has already termed the incursion not a simple matter 
of spying activities but a premeditated and deliberate act of 
military provocation against South Korea.  

      Senior administration officials have said that excluding military 
retaliation, South Korea will take all necessary measures to have 
the North pay due price for the intrusion of armed agents.  

      Kim met the Japanese editors, who are here on an exchange program, 
shortly after the South Korea's foreign minister, Gong Ro-myung, and 
its defense minister, Lee Yang-ho, discussed the issue with U.S. 
Amb. James Laney and Gen. John Tillelli Jr., commander of U.S. 
Forces in Korea.  

      The joint conference was part of South Korea's efforts to exert 
political and diplomatic pressure on North Korea.  

      President Kim told the Japanese editors that Seoul and Washington 
are in a full agreement to maintain close cooperation and deal with 
the incursion case in tandem.  

      South Korea has already taken the infiltration case to the United 
Nations, but neither South Korea nor the United States has taken any 
specific actions against the North.  

      Unconfirmed reports said that South Korea may ask the United States 
to resume the joint annual military exercise, Team Spirit, suspend 
economic aid to the North and slow down the pace of improvement in 
U.S.-North Korea relations.  

      South Korean civic groups are already suspending fund-raising 
campaigns for food aid to North Korea.  

      Minister Gong is scheduled to hold a series of discussions with the 
U.S. secretary of state, Warren Christopher, and Japan's foreign 
minister, Yukihiko Ikeda, in New York.  

      Senior diplomats from the three countries also are to hold a 
working-level discussion in the U.S. city, Korean officials said.  

      South Korea, Japan and the United States are leading the KEDO 
international consortium for building light-water nuclear reactors 
in North Korea in exchange for the North's freeze on its old nuclear 
program.  

      There has been no official word from any of the three capitals about 
whether the infiltration case would affect the work of the Korean 
Peninsula Energy Development Organization.  

      But senior South Korean and U.S. officials said they would push 
ahead with the four-way Korean peace talks with North Korea and 
China.  

      The peace talks, aimed at replacing the Korean armistice regime with 
a permanent peace mechanism, were proposed by President Kim and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton last April.

Resumption of Team Spirit Sought; Seoul to Ask Washington to Restart
Military Exercise 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Lee Sung-yul Staff reporter 

      South Korea will seek the resumption of Team Spirit, a massive 
ROK-U.S. joint military exercise, which has been suspended since 
1992.  

      Apparently angered by the incursion of a North Korean submarine and 
26 commandos, the Defense Ministry said yesterday that it would ask 
the Pentagon to restart the exercise, describing the infiltration on 
the East Coast as the most serious violation in decades following 
the Armistice Agreement that brought truce to the Korean War 
(1950-53).  

      The suggestion for resumption of Team Spirit will be officially 
delivered to the United States during the annual ROK-U.S. Security 
Consultative Meeting slated for Oct. 31-Nov. 1 in Washington D.C., a 
ministry official said.  

      The ministry's moves came while thousands of South Korean troops and 
reservists were searching for the five remaining infiltrators in the 
rugged mountains in the southern outskirts of Kangnung on the East 
Coast for the seventh consecutive day.  

      Team Spirit, which started in 1976, was suspended since 1992 except 
in 1993 to help ease tension in the Korean Peninsula. The ministry 
said that the suspension of the exercise was conditional on North 
Korea's promise to refrain from military provocations.  

      But the latest North Korean provocation is a direct challenge to the 
joint South Korea-U.S. efforts to ease tension on the Korean 
Peninsula, the ministry charged, calling the submarine incursion ``a 
grave act of military provocation.''  

      The ministry's statement came after early-morning high-level talks 
in Seoul between Foreign Minister Gong Ro-Myung, Defense Minister 
Lee Yang-Ho, U.S. Amb. James Laney and Gen. John H. Tilelli, the top 
U.S. general in South Korea.  

      Team Spirit was one of the world's largest-scale military maneuvers, 
involving some 218,000 troops at its peak in 1986, including 37,000 
U.S. Forces Korea and thousands of other troops flown from overseas 
bases.  

      North Korea, describing it as a rehearsal to invade the North, 
called for its suspension as a precondition for its agreement in 
1994 to stop its suspected nuclear weapons program.  

      The manhunt for the die-hard infiltrators continued, but there was 
no contact with the die-hard fleeing North Korean agents since 
Sunday morning till yesterday afternoon, the ministry said.  

      An estimated 26 armed North Korean agents have infiltrated the 
nation, abandoning their stranded submarine before dawn Sept. 19.  

      Three South Korean soldiers have been killed, while 20 North Korean 
intruders were either killed or found dead. One has been captured.  

      On Monday evening, the South Korean government flatly rejected a 
North Korean demand to return the submarine, which was found wrecked 
on a reef on a beach near Kangnung some 240 km east of Seoul.  

      ``The North Korean demand to return the submarine is not worth even 
a consideration, in that all the provocative intention surrounding 
the submarine has been brought to light,'' said Defense Ministry 
spokesman Yoon Chang-ro.  

      The North Korean submarine ``apparently had a well-planned, 
intentional mission which amounted to an armed provocation,'' said 
Yoon.  

      He also said that ``the North Koreans' intention is well 
demonstrated by the fact that all of the crew members were 
well-armed officers at the Reconnaissance Bureau under the North 
Korean Ministry of the People's Armed Forces, which specializes in 
infiltrating special agents and spies into the South.''  

      Yoon concluded that the Communist regime's demand to return the 
submarine, ``made six days after the infiltration, is just a sheer 
attempt to ease the worsening international atmosphere against its 
absurd infiltration.''  

      Another government spokesman said that the South could comply with a 
negotiation for the return of the submarine only after North Korea 
apologizes for the infiltration and punish those North Koreans 
responsible for the incursion.  

      Defense ministry officials said that the North Korean submarine 
never drifted nor had any engine trouble, but that it successfully 
infiltrated into the beach south of Kangnung.  

      The tide flew northward at that time, and it doesn't make sense that 
the submarine drifted southward. In addition, the submarine never 
sent an SOS message, the officials said.  

      The dead leader of the infiltrators, identified as Col. Kim 
Dong-won, had infiltrated into the South twice before, the officials 
said, quoting the captured North Korean, Lee Kwang-soo, 31.  

      They noted that North Koreans last week refused to accept a protest 
message of the United Nations Command at a meeting at the truce 
village of Panmunjom. At that time, the North Koreans alleged they 
never sent a submarine to the South, the ministry officials noted.  

      The submarine just ran aground while trying to return to the North 
after an unspecified mission, the officials said, adding that the 
stranded submarine actually had a clear-cut mission, which has yet 
to be known.  

      They also noted that some of the North Korean infiltrators were in 
South Korean Army uniforms and armed themselves with South Korean 
Army rifles. In addition, 11 of them were found dead, allowing 
themselves to be shot dead by their colleagues, apparently at orders 
from Pyongyang, they said.  

      ``North Koreans are trying to deceive the world, but all the 
evidence ran counter to their absurd allegation,'' a ministry 
official said. The official said that ``we are willing to return the 
bodies of the dead infiltrators.''  

      He further said that ``we are simply concerned how far the 
unpredictable nature of the North Korean regime would go.''  

      In a statement released Monday by the North Korean Central News 
Agency, Pyongyang called on the South to return the submarine and 
its crew.  

      The submarine was found wrecked on a reef just scores of meter from 
a beach before dawn Wednesday, from which an estimated 26 North 
Korean agents have landed.

Korean, U.S. Officials Decide to Remain Vigilant; In the Wake of Armed
North Korean Agents" Infiltration Last Week 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Kim Kyung-ho Staff reporter 

      Top South Korean and U.S. officials decided yesterday to maintain a 
higher degree of vigilance in wake of armed North Korean agents' 
infiltration into South Korea last week.  

      The decision was made at a meeting among Foreign Minister Gong 
Ro-myung, Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho, U.S. Amb. James Laney and 
Gen. John Tilelli, Jr., commander of the U.S. forces.  

      The top foreign policy and defense officials reaffirmed the South 
Korean and the United States' position to maintain strong joint 
defense capabilities to cope with any possible military adventure by 
North Korea.  

      At a breakfast meeting at Gong's residence, the four officials also 
agreed to issue a strong warning to North Korea against its 
infiltration of ``armed commandos'' into the South.  

      ``Participants agreed on the necessity of sending North Korea a 
strong warning that the military provocation not only betrays Korean 
people's sincere wish to establish peace and stability on the Korean 
Peninsula through inter-Korean talks, but also runs counter to the 
efforts of the international community that has donated humanitarian 
aid to North Korea,'' said a press release issued after the meeting. 
 

      The officials agreed the infiltration of armed North Korean 
commandos is not only a violation of the 1953 Armistice Agreement 
that ended the Korean War but also a serious threat to the security 
of the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding region.  

      They emphasized that the armistice agreement should be maintained 
until a new peace regime is established on the peninsula through 
direct negotiations between South and North Korea.  

      Furthermore, the officials agreed to take strong measures to 
dissuade North Korea from what they termed the anachronistic 
illusion of unifying the Korean Peninsula by military means.  

      They also agreed South Korea and the United States will maintain 
close coordination in bringing the whole truth about the 
infiltration to the light.  

      But the South Korean and U.S. officials did not discuss whether to 
resume the South Korean-U.S. joint military exercise, Team Spirit, 
suspended in 1994, said a South Korean Foreign Ministry official.  

      ``At this stage, adding new military capabilities is not being 
considered,'' he said.  

      Specific measures to be taken against North Korea, including details 
of the warning, will be discussed at a meeting between Gong and U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in New York Tuesday, the 
official said.  

      Gong left for New York after yesterday's meeting.  

      Following his talks with Christopher, he is scheduled to meet with 
his Japanese counterpart Yukihiko Ikeda to discuss the North Korean 
provocation.  

      The foreign ministers' meetings will be followed by tripartite 
consultations among senior officials from South Korea, the United 
States and Japan to be held in New York Thursday.  

      While seeking measures to make North Korea pay the price for the 
armed provocation, South Korean officials have suggested they will 
maintain the framework of the existing policy toward North Korea.  

      Gong recently said the infiltration of armed North Korean agents 
would halt economic cooperation with and humanitarian aid to North 
Korea for a considerable time.  

      Seoul officials have left open the possibility of South Korea 
reconsidering its commitment to a U.S.-initiated international 
project to build light-water reactors in the North in return for 
Pyongyang freezing its suspected nuclear weapons program.  

      They have also pledged to pursue punitive measures against North 
Korea within the U.N. Security Council when the details of the 
incident are uncovered.  

      But Gong said South Korea will continue to push for the four-way 
peace talks Seoul and Washington proposed to hold with Pyongyang and 
Beijing.  

      While rejecting North Korea's claim its submarine was on a routine 
mission when it ran aground off South Korea's eastern coast, 
Washington expressed its hope that the incident will not worsen 
tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  

      U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told a news conference in 
Stockholm Monday ``All of our evidence suggests that this North 
Korean submarine was not on a routine mission.''  

      But he said Washington wants South and North Korea to ``work to try 
to keep this from becoming an incident beyond the damage that has 
already been caused.''  

      He said it is still important to proceed with the proposed four-way 
peace talks.

Rep. Lee Myung-bak's Election Scandal a Political Liability for NKP 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Shin Yong-bae Staff reporter 

      With two of his staff members under arrest, Rep. Lee Myung-bak 
accused of election fraud, has become a political liability for the 
ruling New Korea Party.  

      The ruling party is considering expelling Rep. Lee from the party in 
an effort to contain fallout from the scandal involving Lee's 
campaign spending during the April general elections.  

      While the ruling party is trying to extricate itself from the 
uproar, the main opposition National Congress for New Politics is 
stepping up an offensive against its rival.  

      Ruling party leaders were embarrassed when the secret departure of 
one of Rep. Lee's former campaign workers, Kim Yu-chan, to a foreign 
country was found to have been arranged by Lee's aides.  

      Kim disappeared after alleging two weeks ago that Rep. Lee had spent 
more money than legally allowed in the April vote.  

      On Sunday, the prosecution arrested two of Lee's aides on charges of 
helping Kim escape to Hong Kong Sept. 15. They were under suspicion 
of giving him $18,000 in travel expenses.  

      In a statement issued Monday, the ruling party apologized to the 
public for the alleged involvement of Lee's aides in Kim's escape.  

      The ruling party also offered an apology to the National Congress 
for New Politics for its previous claim that the opposition party 
helped Kim leave the country.  

      It is unusual for the ruling party to offer an official apology to 
an opposition party.  

      Ruling party officials expressed anger that the party was humiliated 
because Rep. Lee had allegedly lied about the accusations. They were 
referring to a news conference last week, in which Rep. Lee denied 
Kim's allegations.  

      The officials said party leaders are nearing a consensus that Rep. 
Lee should leave the party, holding himself responsible for the 
scandal.  

      Party Secretary-General Kang Sam-jae hinted that the party will soon 
expel Rep. Lee if he should refuse to leave the party voluntarily.  

      ``It will not take much time for the party to decide what measures 
it will take against him because the outcome of the prosecution's 
investigations into the scandal will come out soon,'' 
Secretary-General Kang said.  

      The opposition National Congress for New Politics, which welcomed 
the ruling party's apology, demanded Rep. Lee resign immediately.  

      A spokesman for the opposition party said that Rep. Lee should 
resign as a member of the National Assembly for his alleged 
implication in Kim's escape though it has yet be confirmed.  

      A ruling party official, who contacted Lee, quoted him as saying 
that he did not order his aides to arrange Kim's escape.  

      The National Congress for New Politics also urged the prosecution to 
summon Rep. Lee immediately and take legal action.  

      The opposition party, which believes that the scandal is the tip of 
the iceberg of election fraud allegedly committed by the ruling 
party during the April vote, is preparing to intensify its attack on 
the ruling party.

Democratic Party Moves Closer to a Breakup 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The small opposition Democratic Party (DP) is moving closer to a 
breakup, with its leader, Lee Ki-taek, demanding that Rep. Jei 
Jung-gu from his rival faction resign as floor leader.  

      Lee's mainstream faction's attack on the minority group of reform 
advocates is fueling speculations that the party is headed for a 
breakup.  

      ``Rep. Jei should resign as floor leader because he abandoned his 
job as party official and joined a reformist group,'' Rep. Lee 
Choong-jae, a leader of the main faction, said on behalf of the 
main-stream faction in a party caucus held in the National Assembly 
yesterday.  

      Rep. Jei, a leading member of the party's reformist faction, has 
been under pressure to step down since his faction launched an 
organization, the Council for National Unification, Monday in a 
revolt against party president Lee's leadership.  

      The launch of the council was seen as the reform-minded group's move 
to seek a divorce from Lee Ki-taek's main faction.  

      Earlier this week, the DP leadership accused the reformist group of 
damaging party unity by launching a separate faction.  

      The strife between the DP's rival factions surfaced when Lee was 
elected to the top post in a national convention in June.  

      Members of the reformist faction, including Rep. Jei, have since 
refused to work under Lee's command.  

      Rep. Jei refused to accept the main faction's demands, saying, ``Our 
council is only part of regular party affairs. Party president Lee 
should take proper procedures before demanding my resignation.''  

      Among the members of Rep. Jei's group, led by former party Chairman 
Kim Won-ki, are Reps. Lee Soo-in, Lee Mi-kyung and Kim Hong-shin and 
former lawmakers who failed to retain congressional seats in April's 
elections.

Search Operations Likely to Be Protracted; Inspections on Streets Stepped
Up in Case Agents Break Blockade 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      With five North Korean intruders presumed to be still at large in 
mountains near Kangnung, the search operations showed signs 
yesterday of becoming protracted.  

      Military officials said they were preparing for the possibility of 
long-term operations, as the manhunt for the fleeing infiltrators 
was at an impasse.  

      Thousands of troops continued to comb through mountains and possible 
escape routes, but failed to track down the North Koreans.  

      Out of an estimated 26 North Koreans from a submarine which was 
found wrecked on the Kangnung shores Wednesday, 21 had been 
accounted for as of yesterday _ nine were killed in shootouts, 11 
found dead and one captured alive.  

      The search operations focused on Mt. Chilsong, where some of the 
remaining North Koreans were believed to be hiding.  

      Loudspeakers blared taped messages of the captured submarine 
crewman, Lee Kwang-soo, and leaflets calling for surrender were 
scattered from helicopters.  

      The Army also stepped up security along coastal roads to block the 
North Koreans from attempting to escape by sea.  

      It was unlikely that the intruders escaped through several layers of 
cordon in the areas, the officials said.  

      They, however, began to talk about the possibility of changing 
tactics if the intruders are not rounded up within a few days.  

      No traces of the North Koreans have been found since the captain of 
the submarine was killed in a shootout on Mt. Chilsong around 6:40 
a.m. Sunday.  

      Some analysts said some of the North Korean agents might have 
escaped the cordons and were heading toward North Korea via mountain 
routes. They also raised the possibility that the intruders might 
have sneaked into Kangnung after camouflaging themselves as South 
Korean civilians.  

      To cope with such possibilities, the officials said, the military 
has stepped up inspections along the streets of the city.  

      They also said they were considering mobilizing Cobra combat 
helicopters for pursuit operations in mountains.  

      While search operations were under way on Mt. Chilsong Monday 
evening, a light suspected to be reflected from a weapon was spotted 
moving along a ridge. Search teams, however, could not find traces 
of the intruders.

Controversy Expected Over Medical Compensation Bill 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Song Jung-tae Staff reporter 

      Years-long controversy will likely flare up again as the Ministry of 
Health and Welfare is seeking to legislate a law designed to mediate 
medical disputes between doctors and patients.  

      The ministry made public yesterday a draft bill on mediating medical 
disputes, which would make it mandatory for doctors, herb doctors 
and dentists to join the tentatively named ``Medical Compensation 
Mutual-Aid Association.''  

      Concerned parties who does not join the association will be fined up 
to 10 million won.  

      The ministry, after collecting from opinions from the parties 
concerned, plans to submit the bill to the National Assembly within 
this year for legislation, officials said.  

      They said the ministry, if things go well, plans to put the law into 
effect beginning 1998.  

      According to the draft bill, the association would compensate for 
patients or their families when disputes occur over accidents, which 
occur without any remarkable errors committed by doctors.  

      `` Anyone who wants to receive compensation would be required to go 
through mediation before bringing accident cases to court,'' said 
Rhie Dong-mo, director general of the ministry's Bureau of Medical 
Affairs.  

      For this, a mediation committee on medical dispute would be set up 
under the ministry, and city and provincial governments beginning 
1998, he said.  

      Those who can file a mediation with the mediation committee would be 
limited to patients, or their representatives. Those who are 
eligible to become representatives would include lawyers, medical 
personnel, legal representatives, spouses and direct family members 
such as brothers and sisters.  

      Anyone who assaults doctors or is involved in other violent actions 
during medical disputes would be severely punished.  

      There has been many reports that family members of patients have 
destroyed medical equipment or facilities, employed violence against 
doctors when patients die in the process of medical treatment.  

      The draft bill, however, faced opposition in part from the medical 
society.  

      The Korean Hospitals Association (KHA), a group of hospitals, said 
that it is irrational for the government to force the Medical 
Compensation Mutual-Aid Association alone to compensate the patients 
for accidents which occur without any remarkable errors committed by 
doctors. In other words, these cases involve accidents whose exact 
cause is not revealed.  

      Lee Jun-hyup, a spokesman for the KHA, said, ``In such cases, 
government should shared a burden together with the Medical 
Compensation Mutual-Aid Association.''  

      The Korea Medical Association, a group of doctors, took a similar 
stance.  

      Kim Jung-soo, a spokesman for the KMA, said, ``We cannot accept the 
bill. It is absurd for medical personnel to take the whole 
responsibility for accidents.''  

      He asked back, ``When patients die despite every effort by doctors, 
who should take responsibility for the cases? In the cases, the 
government should compensate.''  

      Doctors are regulated to provide medical treatment for all patients 
including those who in their terminal stage. However, such cases 
involves the likelihood for doctors to be engaged in dispute, Kim 
explained.  

      In 1994, a similar bill was submitted to the National Assembly by 
the ministry for legislation amid desperate opposition from the 
medical society, and was under deliberation at the National 
Assembly's Health and Welfare Committee last year.  

      But the bill was discarded in the wake of the end of the term of the 
14th National Assembly in earlier June.

KATA Chairman Honored With Silver Tower 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Chung Un-sik, chairman of the Korea Association of Travel Agents 
(KATA), yesterday received the Order of Industrial Service Merit, 
Silver Tower, becoming the first representative from the travel 
agent industry to be honored by the government for their 
contribution to spurring the nation's economy.  

      The tourism industry has been promoted by the South Korean 
government as an ``industry without chimneys,'' and Culture and 
Sports Minister Kim Young-soo conferred the order and other awards 
at the Seoul Sejong Cultural Center yesterday in commemoration of 
the 23rd World Tourism Day which fell on Sept. 27.  

      Chung, 61, who also heads the Edu Tours Co., is widely hailed in the 
industry as a pioneer in the development of new travel products and 
diversifying tourism markets including the former Communist bloc of 
Eastern Europe and Latin American countries.  

      The most representative of his innovative approach to new travel 
products is the ``Backpack Europe Trip with the Eurail Pass,'' which 
enjoyed phenomenal success with collegians after foreign travel was 
completely liberalized in 1989.  

      His lifetime devotion to the tourism industry started out in 1959 as 
a travel manager. He then was promoted to executive sales director 
of C.F. Sharp Co., a representative agency for Northwest Airlines 
sales office in Korea.  

      From these experiences, he set up his own company, the Seoul Travel 
Co., in 1971, the predecessor to Edu Tours.  

      He is widely involved in international tourism associations. As a 
member of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), he brought the 
43rd PATA Annual Conference to Seoul in 1994 as the city celebrated 
600th anniversary as the nation's capital.  

      In 1993, he was elected the first international representative from 
the Asian region of the American Society of Travel Agencies.  

      For his work in furthering international tourism, he received the 
``Golden Helm'' Award at the 1992 International Travel and Tourism 
Berlin held in Germany.  

      Chung was awarded along with Chung Hee-ja, president of Hilton Hotel 
Seoul who received the Gold Tower, and Her Tae-hak, head of Yongin 
Everland, who received the Bronze Tower.

Editorial; Sober, Austere Chusok Holidays 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      An intrinsic desire of human beings to lead a better life often 
serves as the strongest motive to propel society to further develop 
itself. History testifies, however, that a society's ability to 
enjoy enduring development depends largely on how it values the 
better life. Invariably, overindulgence in luxuries has ended in 
catastrophes.  

      In Korea, moderation and decency have long been regarded as 
overriding virtues and a guiding philosophical value inherent among 
the Korean people for centuries. Certainly, Korea has achieved 
remarkable progress, especially economically, in the past decade or 
two. And we Koreans can surely deserve and afford to lead a life 
matching our economic affluence.  

      Yet, it is a pity to see some people indulging in indiscreet 
consumption and extravagance. Korea's per capita GNP is still in the 
neighborhood of $10,000. But the lifestyle pursued by some people 
makes us wonder if our per capita income has already reached the 
$30,000 mark. A Seoul department store reports that it daily sells 
about 500 ready-made suits that each costs more than 600,000 won, or 
roughly $700, offering us an example of the trend of the times.  

      Imports of such nonessential consumer goods as chocolate and golf 
clubs are reported to be increasing sharply. For instance, imports 
of carpets increased 32 percent to more than $15 million last year, 
while that of refrigerators rose 58.4 percent to $32 million during 
the same period. The nation, of course, needs to import more 
products to defuse foreign trade pressure and to live up to the 
spirit of reciprocity in world trade. However, excessive importation 
of luxury consumer goods poses problems outside the sphere of 
economics.  

      Moreover, our country is divided, the northern half of which is 
dominated by constantly belligerent Communists whose ultimate goal 
remains the communization of the whole Korean Peninsula. At this 
very moment, armed North Korean infiltrators are foraying our 
countryside in a vicious scheme to frustrate our stability and 
integrity. It is in such an environment that we must pursue and 
maintain our national harmony. Overindulgence in luxury by some 
segments of society undermines that harmony and solidarity. Some may 
argue that it is up to the individual to lead the lifestyle of his 
choosing. Yet it must be fully realized that they cannot be immune 
to the obligations and morality of society.  

      During the Chusok holidays that begin tomorrow, people are inclined 
to be a bit too lavish with their clothing, gifts and shopping 
sprees. That people make sure they enjoy every bit of the festive 
season is good and laudable. However, they should plan for the 
holidays within their means and in ways possible. A more simple, 
austere and streamlined lifestyle, corresponding to the realities he 
or she faces, should be in place. Everything that is traditional 
cannot necessarily be considered good. As regards to gift-giving, 
choosing prohibitively expensive luxury items comparable to bribery 
may reveal bad taste and could endanger the good will of the 
receiver.  

      Local mass media could be chided for their sensational treatment of 
such joyous holiday activities as superfluous shopping and 
merrymaking. They allegedly are serving the interests of their 
audiences and that may be true to some extent. However, they are 
guilty of engaging in what amounts to advertisement and agitation 
for a variety of Chusok sprees.  

      In order to help ease horrendous traffic gridlocks, visitors to 
homes and ancestral graveyards in the countryside could either 
stagger their traveling times or advance the dates for visits under 
the guidance of a credible public organization.  

      Extravagance by some indiscreet people leads to the detriment of 
others. The wasteful quest for luxury never results in good. 
Moderation and decency is what must supplant such a quest. The 
overall tenor of Chusok events is centered not so much on the 
material side as it is on the showing of gratitude for the bountiful 
blessings of the season.

Over 7,000 Cars Sold in January-August; Chrysler Takes Lead in Top 5
Foreign-Made Car Sales 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Lee Kap-soo Staff reporter 

      Despite the worsening economic situation in the country, foreign 
automakers here are enjoying a lucrative business performance 
nowadays.  

      According to statistics released by the Korea Automobile Importers' 
Association (KAIA), the domestic sales of foreign-made cars totaled 
7,073 units in the first eight months of this year, up 52.9 percent 
from the 4,627 units recorded in the same 1995 span.  

      The number of foreign-made cars sold in Korea rose sharply from 
1,827 units in 1992 to 1,975 units in 1993, 3,903 units in 1994 and 
further to 6,399 units in 1995.  

      The top five best-selling foreign cars on the domestic market so far 
this year were Chrysler of the United States, Volvo and SAAB of 
Sweden and BMW and Mercedes-Benz of Germany.  

      Chrysler sold the most on the domestic market during the 
January-August period of 1996 with 1,398 units, followed by BMW with 
1,064 units and Mercedes-Benz with 961 units.  

      Volvo ranked fourth with 821 units, followed by SAAB with 586 units, 
Audi with 485 units, Ford with 432 units and General Motors with 412 
units.  

      By country, U.S.-made cars topped the list of domestic sales with 
3,238 units during the first eight months of 1996, accounting for 45 
percent of all the foreign-made cars sold in the country.  

      Cars from Germany came next with 2,428 units (34 percent of the 
total), followed by those from Sweden with 1,210 units (17 percent) 
and those from France with 177 units (2 percent).  

      By size, foreign-made cars with an engine capacity ranging from 
2,001cc to 3,000cc sold the most on the domestic market with 3,508 
units during the January-August period of 1996, representing 49.6 
percent of the total sales of foreign cars here.  

      Mid-size foreign cars with an engine capacity of less than 2,000cc 
ranked second with the domestic sales figure of 2,072 units (29.3 
percent of the total), followed by big-size sedans with an engine 
capacity of 3,001cc-4,000cc with 1,125 units (15.9 percent) and 
super-size luxurious sedan with an engine capacity of over 4,000cc 
with 368 units (5.2 percent).  

      Auto experts here attributed the surge in foreign car sales on the 
domestic market mainly to the lowering prices of foreign cars 
stemming from a sharp reduction in the acquisition and special 
excise taxes on medium- and large-size cars and intensified sales 
activities of foreign automakers here.  

      In July alone, 1,320 foreign-made cars were sold in Korea, a 
whopping rise of 78.8 percent from a year earlier, indicating that 
the domestic demands for foreign cars are showing an explosive 
growth, even though the Seoul government strongly calls for the curb 
of excessive consumption out of fear about the nation's snowballing 
trade deficits.  

      If this trend continues, the domestic sales figure of foreign-made 
cars is expected to reach some 14,000 units this year and 30,000 
units next year, far exceeding the 7,804 recorded in 1995, they 
said.  

      The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association (KAMA) also forecasts 
that the nation's import of foreign-made cars would exceed 100,000 
units in 2000, accounting for some 3-5 percent of the domestic 
automobile market.  

      The comparable portion of foreign automobiles was 0.44 percent in 
1995, 0.55 percent in May this year and 0.7 percent in August.  

      Most market watchers even predict that foreign automakers will 
rapidly encroach upon the domestic passenger car market over the 
coming 10 years at the least.  

      One of the key factors behind these rosy prospects is the changing 
attitude of Korean consumers toward foreign-made cars.  

      According to a recent survey of car owners conducted by Hyundai 
Motor Co., for instance, 39.9 percent of the respondents replied 
that they would choose a foreign-made car rather than a Korean-made 
one if the prices of the both are pretty much the same.  

      Aggressive sales promotion activities and the introduction of new 
and diversified models by foreign automakers here have also greatly 
contributed to the brisk sales of foreign-made cars in Korea, market 
experts say.  

      Among those are the introduction of relatively low-price 
foreign-made cars ranging from 10 million won (some $12,300) to 20 
million won per unit, the free supply of some expendable auto parts 
to consumers and guaranteed vehicle maintenance lasting for three 
years after the purchase.  

      However, there are still several negative factors.  

      ``We can cite the social climate here as the Achilles' heel for 
foreign automakers. Accordingly, the domestic sales of foreign-made 
cars may turn from a sharp rise to a steep drop if the nation's 
current account deficit continues snowballing rapidly and the social 
environment turns against excessive consumption in the future,'' 
said Kim Young-tae, a senior official of the KAMA.  

      ``At the same time, the competitiveness of foreign automakers still 
lags behind that of domestic car producers in terms of after-sales 
service mainly because of the insufficient number of service centers 
and vehicle maintenance technicians-plus the slow supply of some 
auto parts,'' he said.  

      If foreign automakers remove such negative factors, the domestic 
market share of foreign-made cars is likely to expand at a rapid 
pace in the years ahead, he added.  

      Reflective of the brisk sales of foreign-made cars here, in the 
meantime, two out of the 11 importers and sales agents for foreign 
cars in the country saw the annual sales figure exceed 1,000 units 
for the first time.  

      The annual sales figure of 1,000 cars is regarded by most auto 
experts as the break-even-point of foreign automakers.  

      Woo Sung Industrial Co., an importer and domestic sales agent for 
Chrysler, sold 1,398 units during the first eight months of the 
year, a significant rise of 79.2 percent from the same period of 
1995.  

      Kolon International Corp., a sales agent for BMW, also sold 1,064 
units in the eight-month period, a 121.1 percent surge from a year 
ago.  

      The domestic sales figure during the same period stood at 961 for 
Han Sung Motor Co., a sales agent for Mercedes-Benz; 821 for Hanjin 
Engineering & Construction Co., a Volvo agent; 693 for Hyosung 
Corp., a Volkswagen and Audi agent; and 602 for Inchcape Korea, a 
sales agent for General Motors, Jaguar, Land Rover, Rolls-Royce and 
Avalon of Toyota.  

      Ford Korea, a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. in Seoul which initiated 
the domestic car sales business in early June, sold 432 units during 
the June-August period of 1996.

Market & Economic Viewpoint (By Seong C. Gweon); Are All Banks the Same? 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Seong C. Gweon 

      This is what actually happened in an executive meeting of a major 
bank, according to a recent (Sept. 21) report in the Korea Economic 
Daily. The bank had to reach a final decision to submit a bid for a 
deposit as much as 118.5 billion won to the Ministry of Information 
and Communication. ``An annual rate of 13.5 percent is a must,'' 
said a director of business at large while another director in 
charge of investment argued for 13 percent at the highest. The 
latter said, ``The going market rate is a little over 12 percent and 
thus it is almost impossible to earn more than 13 percent even if we 
get the money.'' Guess what? The majority opted for 13.5 percent, 
the higher rate, as usual.  

      Many Korean banks _ firms in other sectors as well _  still think 
size or market share is more important than profitability. 
Operations of banks have been heavily controlled by the government, 
which would like to pump money into strategic sectors. Therefore, 
the management of a bank is more sensitive to what the government 
wants to do rather than how much its shareholders want them to earn. 
 

      This can explain the differences in profitability between Korean 
banks and foreign banks. For example, the average return on assets 
for 25 Korean banks in 1995 was 0.32 percent whereas that for the 
branches in Seoul of foreign banks was 1.17 percent. This difference 
is too big to be explained by the fact that domestic banks operate 
in a more restrictive environment. Here are a couple of more 
comparisons: The seven largest U.S. banks as a whole earned 1.62 
percent on their assets and the top seven British banks earned 1.29 
percent. Net income per employee for Korean banks was only one fifth 
of that for U.S. banks and a third of that for Japanese banks.  

      Is the bank mentioned at the beginning going to lose money to pay 
more than they will be able to earn? Better not. After all, they 
will not lose because it won't be a difficult task to charge more 
than 13 percent on their lendings. How? It's almost certain that 
there will be a sufficient number of companies, more often smaller 
ones, which are in desperate need of money. This is said to be one 
of many reasons why Korean firms are suffering from a low margin. In 
other words, firms, i.e., their clients, fall victim to less 
competitive, and thus less productive banks.   

Banks on buy list  

      Still, banks are making money! Ironically, as the economy becomes 
weaker, they seem to be better positioned than any other industries 
in Korea. A broker in the international marketing department of a 
major securities company said the other day that foreign 
institutions showed more interest in Korean banks, but the question 
is: Are all banks the same?  

      The 12 banks headquartered in Seoul and the 13 provincial banks were 
analysed. Prices as of Sept. 18 are on the y-axis in the chart shown 
and earnings per share (EPS) on the x-axis. The regression line fits 
the 25 points, which stand for the banks (their names appear only if 
they are specifically mentioned) and expresses the ``positive'' 
relationship between price and EPS. The line cuts the y-axis at 
6,813 which means that a bank with a ``zero'' EPS may still sell for 
6,813 won. A bank located above the line is considered to be 
relatively overvalued and vice versa. For example, Cheju and Shinhan 
look way off this line, meaning they are ``more expensive'' in a 
relative sense than the other banks.  

      There are three more diagonal lines, denoting the 
price-earnings(p/e) multiples equal to 5, 10 and 20 times. For 
example, the price being equal to 10,500 won and the EPS equal to 
2,198 won, the multiple for Kyongnam is 4.7 times, which makes the 
corresponding point just off the p/e5 line. Similarly, the p/e for 
Foreign Exchange is 10.2 times with the price being equal to 9,150 
won and the EPS equal to 893 won. Those 25 banks have been grouped 
arbitrarily. The banks in the first group realized a loss in the 
first half of this year. Those in the second group, 13 in total, 
have a p/e multiple of 10 times or above. Considering that the 
market multiple is about 18 times and that bank stocks in general 
are supposed to be less volatile than the market average, they seem 
to be somewhat overvalued except those near or below the p/e10 line 
such as Cho-hung, Foreign Exchange and Commercial. The last group 
consists of 6 banks whose p/e's are a little larger or smaller than 
5 times. If the p/e multiple sums up everything relevant in valuing 
a stock, these stocks should be fundamentally undervalued.  

      What if the two valuations were combined? Stocks below both the 
p/e10 line and the regression line may be said to be ``truly'' 
undervalued. Those belonging to this category are Commercial, Pusan, 
Daegu and Kyongnam.  

      Although this kind of analysis has its own merit, one caveat should 
be properly given. The earnings per share used in the analysis were 
computed by doubling the first-half figures, assuming the full-year 
results would be as good, or bad for some banks, as the first-half 
ones. Instead, the most recent full-year figures (the second half of 
1995 plus the first half of 1996) may be used.  ____

Contemporary Korean Art on Show in Tokyo; Works of 14 Artists Reflecting
"90s Trend Exhibited as Part of Exchange Program 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Cho Yoon-jung Staff reporter 

      The last major exhibition of Korean art to be held at the National 
Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, Japan, was in 1968. Almost 30 years 
later, a show titled ``An Aspect of Korean Art in the 1990s'' opens 
there today through Nov. 17 featuring the work of 14 artists in 
their 30s and 40s.  

      The exhibition is part of an exchange relationship with Korea's 
National Museum of Contemporary Art and has been in the works since 
1992. In preparation, three curators from Japan have been coming to 
Korea regularly over the years to meet with artists and see the 
major exhibitions going on around the country.  

      Next year, an exhibition of Japanese art will be held in Korea.  

      While small shows of Korean art have been held in Japan on a private 
level, none has been able to give a comprehensive view of the state 
of art here. For Korea, Japan has always been a country which has 
been ``so close and yet so far away'' but, in the idealistic view 
perhaps, art has the power to break down barriers and prejudices and 
spark understanding, and this is the context in which the exhibition 
is considered to be important.  

      The 1968 exhibition featured Korea's monochrome art, one of the 
country's most unique art movements when seen in an international 
light. In the time between, art has changed and expanded its 
territory greatly. Into the '90s, art here is as varied and complex 
in expression as it is in other parts of the world reflecting 
greater exposure to international movements and greater dialogue and 
exchange with other artists around the world.  

      The 14 artists chosen cover the fields of painting, sculpture, 
photography and installation. Together their work points to a 
certain emerging direction for Korean art, a direction which has yet 
to be defined in any concrete way even in Korea.  

      The art form to come out of the great expansion in artistic 
expression is the installation though as recently as five years ago 
installations were quite a novelty on the scene.  

      Five artists in the exhibition work on installations _  Kim Soo-ja, 
Park In-churl, U Son-ok, You Maeung-gyun and Yun Suk-nam. Of these 
Kim and Yun tackle the subject of women. Kim makes her statement 
with bundles wrapped in brightly colored cloths, called ``pojagi,'' 
which were indispensable in Korean households. The motif of cloth 
and sewing is one which links generations of women in silent 
sisterhood.  

      Yun is a popular artist who took up her art after first fulfilling 
the expected roles of wife, mother and daughter-in-law. A proponent 
of feminist art here, she presents wooden figures of ``mother,'' 
often using wooden washboards, to symbolize the pains and sorrows of 
women in this society.  

      Both Yun and Kim are also taking part in an exhibition in New York 
titled ``Contemporary Art in Asia: Traditions/ Tensions,'' presented 
by the Asia Society.  

      With the great expansion in artistic mediums, Oum Jeong-soon and Kim 
Ho-deuk are two artists who are still into drawing. Oum is into 
finely detailed, skeletal and almost scientific pictures of plants 
while Kim takes a Zen approach to nature.  

      The environment is an important issue for Bae Bien-u and Kim 
Myung-sook, the trees lovers. Bae is a photographer who concentrates 
on the pine tree, a symbolic tree for the Korean people. Kim draws 
forests, detailed, fine and dense packed with lines going over and 
over each other in pencil, conte and charcoal, leaving no blank 
space on the paper.  

      The rest of the artists _ Je Yeo-ran, Lee Young-bae, Kim Hong-joo 
and Kim Jong-hak _ are painters with a strong experimental streak.  

      Je's work is especially interesting as it shows how the monochrome 
tradition has developed into the '90s. Kim Jong-hak's work shows how 
painting overlaps into the world of installation by incorporating 
nuts and bolts, movie posters, apples and pears. Kim Hong-joo 
presents realist portraits created by inspecting himself in a 
mirror.  

      Realism is an art area where exchange between Korea and Japan is 
also taking place on a private level. While the exhibition of Korean 
art is under way in Tokyo, 12 Japanese artists are taking part in 
``Beautiful Fiction _ Exhibition of Contemporary Realism'' at POSCO 
Gallery in Samsung-dong through Oct. 24.

Family Values Highlighted by Chusok Celebrations 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Kim Min-hee Staff reporter 

      Koreans will celebrate Chusok, the traditional Korean Full Moon Day, 
Friday. The nation's biggest holiday after New Year's Day, the day 
is devoted to ancestral worship and family reunions.  

      Coming on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, Chusok is also 
called Chungchujol, meaning ``mid-autumn day'' or Hangawi, the 
origin of which is unclear.  

      This year, the official Chusok holiday begins tomorrow to last 
through Saturday. But as Sunday follows immediately, most people 
will take four days off in a row.  

      Similar to America's Thanksgiving Day in spirit, the holiday, whose 
unique custom dates back to the reign of King Yuri (24-57 AD) of the 
Silla Kingdom, is originally a time of offering thanks for a 
bountiful harvest combined with the ritual of ancestral worship.  

      Although the tradition is still kept intact, for modern-day Koreans, 
the day's primary function has shifted to the reunion of families as 
a result of the disintegration of the country's extended family 
system.  

      As in the past years, the expressways and other major roads 
throughout the nation are expected to be jampacked with cars 
carrying millions of hometown visitors during the holiday period. 
Last year, more than 27 million people were reported to have 
crisscrossed the nation. This year, the number is expected to be 
less.  

      The festive mood surrounding Chusok is accompanied by a solemn 
spirit. On Chusok, people get up early, change into their Sunday 
best and conduct memorial services, called ``charye,'' at home and 
visit the graves of their ancestors.  

      For the services for the ancestors, people set up tables laden with 
offerings of freshly harvested crops such as rice, an assortment of 
dishes, fruit, and wine made from fresh rice. The day's most popular 
delicacy is ``songpyon,'' half-moon shaped rice cakes. It is made of 
well-kneaded steamed rice powder, stuffed with chestnuts, beans, 
dried Chinese dates or powdered sesame.  

      For those who plan to remain in Seoul during the holiday period, a 
number of cultural events have been organized by the Ministry of 
Culture and Sports.  

      The five ancient palaces in Seoul, Toksu Palace, Kyongbok Palace, 
Changgyong Palace, Chongmyo and Changdok Palace, and the National 
Folklore Museum will remain open to the public.  

      Under the administration of the Cultural Property Preservation 
Bureau, Toksu, Kyongbok and Changgyong palaces and the museum will 
make available their outside grounds for visitors to enjoy some of 
Korea's outdoor folk games, such as ``nolttuigi'' (sea-saw jumping) 
and ``chegichagi'' (shuttlecock kicking).  

      Various concerts of Korean music are also scheduled.  

      In a concert titled ``Song of Hometown'' on Sept. 26, 7:30 p.m., at 
the National Theater, Hanwoori Opera Company will perform lyric and 
popular songs of Korea, targeting specifically those who have left 
their homes in North Korea. Also to be held at the National Theater 
are a pansori performance by Choi Yong-gil and a performance of 
popular and screen music by Seoul Romance Orchestra, at 3 and 7 p.m. 
Saturday, respectively.  

      Sponsored by the Foundation for the Preservation of Cultural 
Properties, there will also be a performance of traditional Korean 
songs and dances Sept. 27-29 at Seoul Norimadang, an outdoor stage 
in Chamsil in southeastern Seoul.

Patent Law Worker Wins Top Prize in National Practical English Contest 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The first prize of the 1996 National Practical English Contest, 
which was held Sept. 21 at KM-TV Hall in Nonhyon-dong, southern 
Seoul, was awarded to Jang Young-yun, who works for Koreana patent 
law firm in Seoul.  

      The second prizes went to Kim Joo-hoon and Jeong Eun-young and the 
third to Kim Young-sook, Kim Young-hwa and Park Jung-chul.  

      Winners of the special prizes for the foreigners who participated in 
the seminar as non-contestants were Aya Katsurayama from Japan and 
Li Jiangping from China.  

      Kim Joo-hoon, one of the two second prize winners, is a junior at 
Yonsei University in Seoul majoring in English language and 
literature. The other winner Jeong Eun-young is a freshman of 
English education at Kyungnam University.  

      The National Practical English Contest is totally different from 
conventional speech contests. At this year's event, each contestant 
was asked to randomly choose a topic regarding the 2002 World Cup or 
an everyday scenario written on a scrap of paper, and then each had 
a spontaneous three-minute conversation with a native speaker based 
on the topic.  

      Fifteen finalists who passed interviews and semifinals held across 
the country competed.  

      The contest was supported by The Korea Herald along with MBC-TV and 
BCM Publishers, Inc. Its sponsors included Daishin Group and WICOM 
Co., Ltd.  

      The first prize winner has been given an opportunity to participate 
in a four-week English language program at the University of 
California, San Diego. The second prize winners will have the chance 
to attend a three-week intensive English- language program at New 
York University, American Language Institute, and at Pacific Gateway 
International College in Vancouver, Canada.

Budget Bill Totals 71.6 Trillion Won; Government Projects 13.7 Percent
Spending Hike Over 1996 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Kwak Young-sup Staff reporter 

      The government yesterday unveiled its 1997 budget plan, which calls 
for total spending of 71.6 trillion won ($89.5 billion), a 13.7 
percent rise from this year's 63 trillion won.  

      The budget proposal is composed of a general-account portion of 
67.78 trillion won, up 12.8 percent from 1996, and a 
3.82-trillion-won special account for fiscal investment and 
financing, a 33.9 percent increase from this year, the Ministry of 
Finance and Economy (MOFE) said yesterday.  

      Approved at a cabinet meeting yesterday, the budget bill will be 
submitted to the National Assembly Oct. 2 for approval.  

      Korean taxpayers face a heavier tax burden next year than this year 
in proportion to the budget increase.  

      The total tax revenues will rise to 21.6 percent of gross national 
product (GNP) next year from this year's 20.9 percent. A Korean 
taxpayer will shoulder an average of 2.06 million won in national 
taxes.  

      The total tax receipts will be composed of 64.23 trillion won in 
national taxes and 3.54 trillion won in nontax revenues.  

      Ministry officials said the 1997 budget bill focuses on expanding 
the nation's infrastructure to help reduce growing logistical costs 
and minimizing a rise in the public sector's fixed expenditures.  

      ``The 1997 budget proposal is characterized by a drastic rise in 
spending on infrastructure projects,'' said Kim Jung-gook, MOFE's 
assistant minister for budget. ``Great emphasis has also been placed 
on improving the productivity of the government sector by cutting 
fixed costs as much as possible.''  

      According to the budget bill, fixed expenditures such as defense 
spending, wages for government workers and grants will rise 11.1 
percent to 37.16 trillion won from this year, while spending on 
government-initiated projects will increase 16.7 percent to 34.44 
trillion won.  

      Defense spending will surge 12 percent to 14.27 trillion won next 
year from this year's 12.73 trillion won, the highest year-on-year 
growth rate since the current ``civilian'' government took office in 
1993.  

      ``We had to take into account the present security situation on the 
Korean Peninsula in raising the defense spending,'' said Kim, the 
chief architect of the 1997 budget proposal.  

      About 47 percent of the defense budget will be used to purchase 
advanced weapons.  

      Spending for the expansion of infrastructure such as ports, highways 
and railroads will jump 24.4 percent to 10.13 trillion won next year 
from this year.  

      The sharp rise in spending on infrastructure projects is designed to 
ease the nation's growing physical distribution costs, which is 
cutting into the overall national competitiveness, Kim said.  

      The government will take the lead in eliminating the nation's 
high-wage structure by restricting growth in the number of 
government workers and their wages.  

      A wage freeze will be imposed on 6,000 senior government officials 
next year, while lower-level employees will be given a 5 percent 
rise in their basic pay only.  

      Spending on education will surge 17.6 percent to 18.63 trillion won 
and 6.67 trillion won will be earmarked for improving the structure 
of the agro-fisheries sector.  

      The 1997 budget will also include a 27.3 percent increase in 
spending for technology and computerization, or 3.22 trillion won; a 
36.3 percent rise in spending on environmental protection, or 2.11 
trillion won; and a 43.4 percent jump in spending for culture and 
sports, or 540.8 billion won.

Current Account Deficit Surges to $15.2 Billion; Chalks up Record High of
$3.4 Billion in August 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The nation's current account deficit surged to a record monthly high 
of $3,487 million in August, bringing the cumulative shortfall in 
the first eight months of the year to $15,243 million, according to 
the Bank of Korea (BOK) yesterday.  

      The aggregate January-August figure already exceeded the 
government-revised latest shortfall prediction of $15 billion for 
the entire year.  

      The central bank predicted Korea's current account deficit for the 
year would reach about $18 billion, accounting for about 3.6 percent 
of the nation's gross national product (GNP).  

      The BOK attributed the galloping current account shortfall mainly to 
a slowdown in exports and a rise in imports and invisible trade 
deficits.  

      ``The January-August current account deficit represents about 3 
percent of the nation's GNP and the expected deficit for September 
would amount to $1.5 billion,'' said Paeng Dong-joon, director of 
the BOK's Statistics Department.  

      The BOK said that trade deficit amounted to $2,848 million in 
August, compared with a trade shortfall of $387 million in August 
last year and $1,662 million in July this year.  

      Exports decreased 8.7 percent from a year ago to $9,553 million on a 
free-on-board basis in August.  

      Cumulative trade deficits during the January-August period amounted 
to $9,715 million, compared with a shortfall of $4,814 million 
during the same 1995 period.  

      ``The slowdown in exports was mainly affected by a continued low 
export price of semiconductor prices,'' Paeng said.  

      He said that the unit export price of Korean-produced 16 mega DRAM 
chips averaged $11.5 in August, a sharp decline from $40 to $45 last 
March. ``But there would be no further drop in the export prices of 
16 mega DRAM chips.''  

      August saw its invisible trade shortfall amount to $592 million, up 
from a deficit of $557 million in July.  

      The central bank cited as major reasons for the hike in invisible 
trade shortfall a surge in overseas travel and shipping expenses.  

      Korea saw a net capital inflow of $1,103 million in August, from a 
net outflow of $140 million in July this year.  

      The nation's foreign exchange holdings decreased from $35 billion at 
the end of July this year to $33.56 billion as of the end of August 
on an outstanding basis.

LG Securities Holds Signing Rite for Korea Bond Fund 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      An international fund investing in Korean bonds has been launched 
for the first time, offering foreign investors an opportunity to 
acquire stakes exclusively in the local bond market.  

      LG Securities Co. held a signing ceremony for its Korea Bond Fund 
(KBF) at the Rainbow Hotel in London Monday. LG is acting as the 
lead manager for the $105 million fund with the participation of 
Nomura International PLC.  

      This is the first time that a country fund designed exclusively for 
foreigners seeking to invest in local bonds has been set up. The 
Korea Fund, the first overseas fund for investment in the Korean 
stock market, was set up 12 years ago.  

      Scudder, Stevens and Clark, Inc., an American investment firm which 
acted as a manager for the Korea Fund, is also acting as a fund 
manager for KBF.  

      Originally planned as a $100 million fund, the KBF had to be 
increased by an additional $5 million due to popular demand by 
foreign investors. The fund is due to be listed on the London Stock 
Exchange in October.  

      The KBF portfolio will be composed of financial and development 
bonds (50 percent or more) and nonguaranteed bonds (20 percent or 
more), both issued by small- and medium-business; nonguaranteed 
bonds with a five-year maturity (10 percent or less) and 
nonguaranteed convertible bonds (10 percent or less), both issued by 
large businesses; and short-term fund management including cash (10 
percent or less).

Globalization Drive Forces Companies to Hire Foreign Staffers 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Korea's giant industrial conglomerates, while cutting back on 
domestic employment to cope with slow business, are sharply 
increasing the hiring of foreign workers as part of their 
globalization strategies, business sources said.  

      The employment of overseas staffers, previously focused on a few 
industrial countries such as the United States, Japan and Canada, 
are now spreading to newly industrializing nations, including China, 
they said.  

      Major conglomerates _  Samsung, Hyundai, LG and Daewoo _  are hiring 
twice as many foreigners as last year to meet the international 
manpower demand in such areas as automobiles, telecommunications and 
computer software. Among the local staff are Korean students 
studying abroad, ethnic Koreans abroad as well as other foreigners.  

      Hyundai Group, for instance, is set to employ 1,000 foreign workers, 
up 200 from last year and has already hired 100 among the majors of 
electronics, bioengineering and high molecule at a recent employment 
fair in the United States. It plans to hold similar fairs in Japan, 
China and Europe to employ 900 others.  

      Samsung Motors Inc., scheduled to roll out assembled passenger cars 
from 1998, picked up seven veteran technicians who retired from 
Japan's Nissan Motor as managers responsible for model development, 
R&D, design and car test. It lately has hired Dr. Song Ji-oh, a 
Korean with career at the General Motors Corp. as the head of the 
in-house research institute.  

      The company plans to hire 110 foreign staff by running ads at 
foreign news media, holding manpower recruitment sessions in major 
industrial countries and accepting recommendations from foreign 
business associations, the sources said.  

      Daewoo Group, under its managerial watchword of global management, 
has recently opened a``global manager's course'' and hired 200 
international staff members who will operate its 16 overseas 
offshoots in Britain, France, Germany and other countries.  

      LG Group also hired 100 foreigners among majors of 
telecommunications and semiconductor in the United States in July to 
meet the manpower demand in these new businesses.  

      The brisk employment of foreign staff, while providing Korean 
employees with fresh incentives for self-development, has its own 
problems, such as the relatively long period of one-to-two years 
required for the foreigners to adapt themselves to the Korean 
corporate culture, the business sources said.

Business Survey Index Hits 92 in Fourth Quarter '96 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The ongoing business slump is expected to continue to grip the 
nation's manufacturing industry in the fourth quarter of the year, 
the Bank of Korea (BOK) said yesterday.  

      In its survey of 2,480 manufacturing and nonmanufacturing companies 
with an annual turnover of 500 million won in the country on their 
business prospects, the central bank has found that the business 
survey index (BSI) for the fourth quarter stands at 92 on average.  

      A BSI reading of 100 means that respondents who see improvements in 
business conditions equal those who expect declines.  

      The fourth-quarter BSI of 1,429 manufacturing companies stands at 94 
and of 1,051 nonmanufacturing companies it is 88.  

      In the meantime, the BSI for the third quarter was 81 for 
manufacturing companies and 76 for nonmanufacturing companies.  

      The manufacturing companies' BSI of 81 for the July-September period 
was the lowest since the index marked 72 in the first quarter of 
1993.  

      Major reasons behind the gloomy prospects for the October-December 
period are the weak value of the Japanese yen, the slow growth in 
domestic consumption, and the decline in export prices of major 
export items, including semiconductors, steel, and petrochemicals, 
BOK officials said.  

      Reflective of the bleak prospects, domestic manufacturing companies 
are moving to curtail their facility investment volume in the months 
ahead with the facility investment BSI standing at 83 for the third 
quarter and 86 for the fourth quarter.  

      The turnover BSI in the fourth quarter was 103 for manufacturing 
companies, up from 90 in the third quarter, and the comparable BSI 
stood at 92 for nonmanufacturing companies, up from 86, indicating 
that their sales are likely to recover from their slump.

Seoul-Inchon Canal Work to Start Next Year 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Work to build an intracity canal passing through the western tip of 
Seoul to the western port city of Inchon will be launched in the 
second half of next year, the Ministry of Construction and 
Transportation said yesterday.  

      The two-phase project for the 18-km waterway primarily intended to 
alleviate heavy inland cargo traffic will be completed in 2010, 
according to the ministry's basic plan.  

      Bidding applications will be accepted until next January and the 
successful bidder will be announced next March.  

      Corporations wishing to participate in the project are required to 
form a consortium with the Korea Water Resources Corporation.  

      The canal will be built for feeder container ships with a maximum 
capacity of 2,500 tons. The waterway will measure six meters in 
depth and 100 meters in width.  

      The project is valued at about 1,000 billion won ($1.25 billion). Of 
the amount, the land acquisition cost which is estimated at 260 
billion won ($325 million), will be funded from the state coffer and 
the remaining cost will be provided by private builders.  

      The successful bidder will have the right to operate the canal and 
charge tolls for 40 years.  

      The canal essentially aims at reducing the ground transportation 
linking Seoul to port facilities of Inchon.  

      Sand excavated from the seabed of the West Sea, containers, steel 
and automobiles will constitute the bulk of the traffic on the 
canal.  

      Upon completion, the canal is expected to help to relieve the 
serious traffic congestion of the Seoul-Pusan highway.  

      ``Currently, the transportation of containers to Seoul from Pusan is 
heavily dependent on the Seoul-Pusan Expressway,'' said a ministry 
official. ``When the canal is completed, containers will be carried 
on sea to Inchon and then through the canal, to Seoul.''

Cultural Dimensions (Column By Robert J. Fouser); Experiment in Korea-Japan
Relations 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Robert J. Fouser 

      Many Japanese writers on Asian affairs refer to Korea as the 
``near-but-far country.'' By this, they mean that Korea is 
culturally and geographically near to, but emotionally far from, 
Japan. Despite the Japanese media's emphasis on distance, changes in 
Japan in the 1990s offer the hope of bringing Korea and Japan 
closer.  

      These changes are occurring the following three areas: travel, 
Korean language education, and research on Korea.  

      An increasing number of Koreans now visit Japan for tourism and 
business. About one third of all foreigners entering Japan are 
Korean. The rapid increase in numbers of Korean tourists means 
increased interaction with Koreans in Japanese tourist and business 
centers. The sight of well-dressed Korean tourists enjoying 
themselves in Japan has dispelled the image of Korea as a poor 
country. Growing trade and business contacts bring more Korean 
business people to Japan.  

      In reverse, a large number of Japanese continue to visit Korea; 
about forty percent of all foreigners visiting Korea are Japanese. 
Intimidated by the high cost of travel in Japan, many Japanese, 
particularly those in western Japan, find it cheaper to visit Korea 
than to go to Tokyo. An increasing number of high school students 
visit Korea for school trips to learn about Korean history.  

      Language learning often follows increased travel and cultural 
exchange. Until the Seoul Olympics in 1988, most Korean language 
education took place in schools for Korean residents in Japan. Since 
the Olympics, Korean language education has spread rapidly beyond 
the Korean community.  

      Although few universities offer a major in Korean language and 
literature, many famous universities now teach a variety of Korean 
language courses. A recent survey by Keidanren, the largest business 
association in Japan, showed that people in their twenties and 
thirties ranked Korean as the third most important foreign language 
for Japanese people to learn. English ranked first, followed by 
Chinese. People in their forties and fifties placed sixth out of the 
eight choices given.  

      Korean language education has also entered the commercial language 
teaching market. A growing number of language institutes offer 
Korean conversation courses. The educational service of NHK TV 
offers a regular course in Korean. A Korean language proficiency 
test is offered twice a year, attracting an rapidly growing number 
of testees.  

      A recent poll by the Japanese Agency for Culture showed that 76 
percent of those polled believe that Japanese people should make a 
greater effort to learn Asian languages (no languages were specified 
in the poll). All of these developments point to continued growth of 
Korean language education in Japan.  

      Related to the boom in Korean language education, is the continued 
growth of research on things Korean in Japan. Armed with ample 
research materials and excellent language skills, Japanese scholars 
of Korean studies produce more research on Korea than in any other 
country outside Korea. Many Koreanologists in Japan have received 
graduated education in Korea and have close contacts with Korean 
researchers.  

      In recent years, Korean studies in Japan has done much to shake off 
the residue of its colonial past. In history, for example, many 
younger scholars have condemned the distortions of Korean history in 
Japanese history textbooks. Internationalization of universities in 
Japan has helped to give institutional support for Korean studies 
and academic exchanges with Korea.  

      None of these developments guarantees that Korean-Japanese relations 
will become chummy over night. Different interpretations of history 
continue to make emotional reconciliation difficult. Korean 
residents in Japan continue to face discrimination in critical 
areas, such as housing and employment. Politicians in both countries 
use mutual feelings of antipathy to whip up nationalist feeling for 
their own political purposes.  

      At the level of human exchange, however, the growing presence of 
Koreans and the Korean language in Japan brings about a sea change 
in Japanese attitudes toward Korea: Korea is now worth taking 
seriously. As a competitor or partner, Japan can no longer afford to 
pretend that Korea is far away.  

      The change in Japanese attitudes is not an accident of history. 
Throughout Japanese history, sudden threats from the outside have 
forced Japan to recognizes changes in the world order. The military 
alliance between the Silla and Tang China against Paekche stimulated 
the growth of strong centralized rule in Japan in the seventh 
century. Commodore Perry's black ships in 1853 led to the Meiji 
Restoration in 1868, which opened Japan to the West.  

      On a smaller scale, the decision to co-host the World Cup in 2002 is 
a similar shock to the collective Japanese psyche. The World Cup is 
also a useful metaphor for recent changes in Japanese attitudes 
toward Korea because the bitter competition to host the event ended 
with both countries being forced to cooperate as partners. With the 
aura of World Cup legitimacy, changes in Japanese attitudes toward 
Korea will accelerate as 2002 approaches.  

      Competition and partnership between Korea and Japan is, like the 
co-hosting of the World Cup, an experiment in relations between the 
two countries: never before have these two countries worked together 
as equal partners. From early sixth century, when the Korean scholar 
Wani gave the Japanese emperor Buddhist sutras and Confucian 
classics, to the controversies over textbooks and the comfort women, 
dominance, whether cultural, political, or military, was the 
prevailing paradigm in Korean-Japanese relations.  

      Soon, the average Japanese person will probably point to Russia when 
asked to find the ``near-but-far country'' on a map. And who knows, 
maybe other geographical controversies will become a thing of the 
past.

MOTIE Plan to Issue Green Cards to Hi-Tech Experts Hits Snag 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The attempt of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy to issue 
special identification cards for high-tech foreign manpower has hit 
a snag, officials said yesterday.  

      It has been pushing for the introduction of the so-called ``green 
card'' system for foreigners with Ph. D degrees or who are 
technological experts with M.A. or M.S. degrees as part of its plan 
to lure more foreign industrial and scientific experts.  

      Under the system, the government will treat the foreign experts like 
overseas Chinese in Korea, by issuing them permanent resident 
permits and allowing them to purchase land up to 660 sq. meters. 
They will also enjoy medical insurance benefits and be able to make 
savings deposits at domestic banks.  

      The ministry had tried to include the related clause in the revised 
External Trade Act but reportedly abandoned the attempt, faced with 
opposition from other ministries, the officials said.  

      Instead of introducing a special ID card system, it decided to 
dispense with the inconveniences foreigners suffer by revising the 
relevant decrees and regulations, they said.  

      The abortive bid is expected to make it more difficult for  the 
nation's major conglomerates to recruit foreign talent, while their 
demand for overseas experts is ever increasing, the officials said.

Business News Briefs; KT Develops CD-ROM Telephone Directory 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The Korea Phone Directory Co. (KPDC), a unit of Korea Telecom, has 
introduced a CD-ROM (compact disc-read only memory) phone directory. 
 

      The CD-ROM phone directory, the first of its kind here, contains all 
of the 4.3 million phone subscribers in Seoul on two diskettes.  

      Equipped with a multimedia service function, the electronic 
directory is capable of classifying all of the paper directory's 
listings into 3,300 kinds of different business or brand groups.  

      KPDC has manufactured 30,000 units of the CD-ROM directories and 
plans to distribute them free of charge.

Dead Leader Infiltrated South Three Times 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      It was the third time for the dead leader of the estimated 26-member 
North Korean infiltrators to have intruded the South since last 
year, a captured North Korean agent has been quoted as saying.  

      Lee Kwang-soo, who was captured unhurt Wednesday evening near 
Kangnung on the East Coast, has told investigators that Col. Kim 
Dong-won had infiltrated into the South aboard a submarine on three 
occasions since last year, a reliable intelligence source said 
yesterday.  

      Col. Kim was the head of a North Korean spy department in charge of 
transporting secret agents, said the source, quoting Lee. He was one 
of the 11 North Korean infiltrators who were found dead on a 
mountain near Kangnung after they deserted their wrecked submarine.  

      It demonstrated that North Koreans have several times sent 
submarines to the South on various missions, said the source who 
demanded anonymity. Lee was brought to Seoul Saturday evening for 
further interrogation.

Business News Briefs; Korean-Made Car Sales in Sweden Rise in '95 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      A total of 2,365 Korean-made cars were sold in Sweden last year, up 
96.4 percent from 1,204 cars in 1994, according to the Korea 
Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) yesterday.  

      The Korean cars accounted for 1.3 percent of 169,756 cars sold in 
the Swedish auto market last year.  

      KOTRA's Stockholm Trade Center, quoting statistics released by the 
Association of Swedish Automobile Manufacturers and Wholesalers, 
reported that the 2,365 cars break down to 2,289 from Hyundai and 76 
cars from Ssangyong Motor Cos.  

      During the January-August period of this year, 2,196 Korean 
automobiles were sold, up 65 percent from the same period of last 
year.  

      The report said sales of Korean cars have continued to grow sharply 
especially after Hyundai's subcompacts ``Accent'' and ``Elantra'' 
have received good response from young Swedish customers.  

      The strong Swedish krona has weakened the competitiveness of Swedish 
cars such as ``Volvo'' and ``Saab,'' while increasing the sales of 
foreign cars, it said.

goods, including shoes, bags, clothes and accessories.  

      The Jewoo spokesman said the joint venture is a natural result of 
the growing demand in the Asia-Pacific region, and that the venture 
will help solidify the commitment Adidas has in this region.

Card May Carry 7 Phone, Contact Numbers; Hyosung Group to Launch One-Number
Service in December 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Yoo Cheong-mo Staff reporter 

      How many telephone numbers are printed on your customer's business 
card?  

      The card may carry up to seven different phone and contact numbers _ 
office phone, car or cellular phone, home phone, pager, fax and 
Internet address.  

      Such a labyrinthine card may cause a lot of confusion, in case you 
would want to contact someone immediately.  

      With the imminent launch of the so-called ``one-number service,'' 
however, your troublesome guesswork of whether to call someone's 
office phone, pager, computer, fax or car phone will soon become a 
thing of the past.  

      The Hyosung Group, ranked 28th in the corporate hierarchy, is now 
pushing to launch the nation's first commercial one-number service 
in Seoul in December. To that end, Hyosung has already created ties 
with AccessLine Technology Inc. (ATI) of the United States, and NTT 
and Marubeni, both of Japan, to establish a 3-billion-won 
joint-venture company, named ``Hyosung One Number Co.'' Hyosung, 
ATI, NTT and Marubeni raised the initial capital at a ratio of 61 
percent, 19 percent, 10 percent and 10 percent.  

      O Hyo-won, who took office as representative director of Hyosung One 
Number Co. early this month, said, ``The individual one number will 
soon emerge as a new symbol of VIP status here.''  

      ``An important business call, if missed because of your absence at a 
certain place, would create billions of won in losses to your 
business. The one number service will prevent such a mishap one 
hundred percent,'' O said.  

      One-number service is a wholly new concept of intelligent 
communications, which is intended to make it easier for people on 
the move to stay in constant touch with their important business and 
personal contacts. One-number subscribers are given a single 
personal number which will integrate all different numbers of their 
communication devices, including office phones, home phones, 
cellular phones, pagers, faxes or car phones. Then, they can always 
be tracked and contacted through one of the six communicators, 
wherever they are staying within the country.  

      Personal numbers are different from regular phone numbers in that 
they're tied to a person, not a place.  

      ``In the near future, nearly a quarter of cellular users will 
subscribe to the one number service,'' O quoted a U.S. market 
research firm as forecasting. ``High-ranking government officials, 
business executives, lawyers, self-employed men, public accountants, 
entertainers and others who are constantly on the move but need to 
be contacted, are among the potential customers of the service,'' he 
said.  

      Despite such enormous convenience and market opportunities of the 
one-number service, the majority of local telecom experts are 
painting a gloomy picture of its future.  

      The number of pagers now in use in Korea has recently exceeded the 
11 million mark. With the paging service already covering the entire 
country, the one-number service will not appear attractive to many 
people.  

      In addition, a new cellular-phone model with built-in paging 
functions will soon come on the market, further narrowing the room 
for Hyosung's successful entry into the one-number market.  

      ``Hyosung has cleared the regulatory hurdle of the Ministry of 
Information and Communication (MIC), which regards the one-number 
service as a value-added service. But it may be too early for the 
one-number service to settle in the Korean market, due to a host of 
unpredictable factors,'' said an industry analyst.  

      ``Considering the unique characteristics of the one-number service, 
active cooperation from existing telecom service carriers, such as 
Korea Telecom (KT), Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT) and paging service 
operators, will be indispensable for the success of the service,'' 
he said. He predicted that it would be very difficult to expect that 
Hyosung can gain proper support and network accesses from KT, KMT 
and paging companies, which are themselves preparing to enter the 
same market.  

      The service's excessively high charges will also pose a big obstacle 
to the immediate popularization of the service, he noted. Hyosung 
forecasts that its one-number subscribers may have to pay more than 
20,000 won in monthly service charges, in addition to an initial 
membership fee of 30,000 won. At present, monthly service rates for 
paging and voice mail services do not exceed 8,000 won and 3,000 
won, respectively.  

      Hyosung's O countered the mounting pessimistic views by 
saying,``We're well aware that potential profitability of the 
one-number service is not as high as it could be. But Hyosung sees 
the one-number industry as a kind of niche market, which may be able 
to secure substantial subscription bases particularly from corporate 
customers.''  

      Commercial one-number services, launched by carriers in the United 
States, Japan and Europe last year and this year, are also suffering 
from a shortage of subscribers.  

      AT & T, which kicked off a $45-a-month one-number service early last 
year, has managed to secure just 280,000 customers so far. The 
number of subscribers to NTT's one-number service, launched in May, 
now totals just 5,000. NTT's subscription target for this year does 
not exceed 10,000. Partly because of the highly uncertain prospects 
for the one-number service, KT, KMT, paging carriers and other 
domestic companies are reportedly taking a very careful approach to 
the market. Hyosung One Number Co. aims to secure about 20,000 
subscribers by the end of next year

Volkswagen to halt Beetle production in Brazil+

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, May 31 Kyodo

     Brazilians will have to say goodbye for the second time to the
hottest-selling car in the nation's history -- the ''Beetle'' model
manufactured by the Brazilian subsidiary of Germany's Volkswagen AG.
     Volkswagen do Brazil announced a plan Friday to cease production
of the popular old-fashioned model June 30, due to the model's low
profit margin.
     Volkswagen has been turning out a sluggish 1,300 Beetles a
month against 2,500 the company had targeted when it resumed assembly
of the model in 1993 after production was halted in 1986.
     Since the first Brazilian-made Beetle left the assembly line in
1959, the model has been the country's best seller, known today as
the ''Fusca.''
     The terminated production of the Beetle will leave millions of
''orphaned fans'' grouped in several fan clubs around the country,
industry analysts said.
     Output of the Beetle has been already ceased in Germany.  As of
July 1, Mexico will be the only country left which still assembles
the model.

Reform of pension fund system outlined, says paper+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     A government study group has drafted an outline for the reform
of the nation's welfare pension fund system, calling for the use of
money pooled under a government-managed pension plan to rescue
financially troubled corporate pension funds, a business daily said
Saturday.
     Corporate employees are entitled to receive pensions from the
government's pension plan for welfare purposes.  Apart from this
system, many business corporations have established their own pension
funds for their employees.
     Each corporate pension fund also manages part of the premiums
collected under the national pension plan, making the latter
susceptible to the former's financial plight.
     The drafted reform, prepared by the study group of the Health
and Welfare Ministry, proposes the government-managed pension plan
provide financial assistance to corporate pension funds when their
investment yields slip below certain levels, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
said.
     The step is in response to the deteriorating financial standing
of corporate pension funds following the bursting of the ''bubble''
economy, the daily said.
     The reform plan also calls for the mandatory participation of
corporate pension funds in a deposit insurance system to protect
against bankruptcy, the newspaper said.
     Under the system, corporate pension funds put up a certain
amount of money to ensure pension payments even in the event of
bankruptcy.  At present, participation in the system is voluntary,
making it difficult to raise deposit rates, the paper said.

Health ministry distributes 'mad cow' booklet+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The Health and Welfare Ministry has distributed an information
booklet to municipal and prefectural offices and other agencies
concerning the ''mad cow'' disease, officials said said Saturday.
     Topics such as the safety of imported beef from Britain, where a
recent outbreak of mad cow disease occurred, and how people may be
affected by the disease are discussed in a question and answer format.
     For example the booklet asks, ''Is imported beef from Britain
dangerous?'' coupled with the reply, ''Because we cannot verify the
safety of British beef, Japan is not allowing British beef into its
market.''
     The booklet is called ''Questions and answers about bovine
spongiform encephalopathy.''
     Scientists believe there is a link between the disease and its
human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a debilitating and
deadly ailment that damages the brain.
     A ministry spokesman said, ''The people in charge of this are
preparing the booklet because there is much confusion about the
issue.''  He added the booklet will provide answers to frequently
asked questions through case studies.
     Ministry officials are hoping to quickly distribute the booklet
to those in the meat importing business and to overseas travelers and
have so far distributed the booklet to about 120 places nationwide,
including airport quarantine offices.
     Information from World Health Organization (WHO) reports and
British authorities has been incorporated into the booklet, ministry
officials said.
     A ministry official said, ''In the end there are many questions
left unresolved.  Our report is based on the knowledge that has been
accumulated so far.''

Communication to start between PHS, cellular phones+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Japanese telecommunications carriers are set to link personal
handy-phone system (PHS) users with those of ordinary cellular
phones, to allow communication between the devices just like ordinary
telephones, a business daily reported Saturday.
     The carriers reached the linkup agreement Friday, the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun said.
     The carriers originally planned to start such an arrangement at
the end of 1997, but decided to advance the plan in response to
strong demand from subscribers, the paper said.
     The new arrangement will eliminate the communication headaches
of 11 million cellular phone users and two million PHS users who are
currently unable to link up with each other.
     Users will have to dig even deeper into their pockets, however,
as the carriers are likely to charge around 400 yen for every three
minutes regardless of the distance between conversation partners,
according to the paper.
     PHS users will be able to initiate calls to cellular phones from
July, but the cellular phone system will not be technically ready to
dial up the PHS before September, the paper said.

Gasoline decontrol forcing oil companies to cut workers+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Japan's recent deregulation of gasoline imports has eroded the
earnings of two large oil refiners, forcing one to cut staff and
another to give up on hiring new graduates next spring, a business
daily said Saturday.
     Nippon Oil Co. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nippon Petroleum
Refining Co., will shave their workforce by combined 600, or 14%, to
3,700 in a four-year program ending in fiscal 1999, the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun said.
     Japan Energy Corp. will stop recruiting fresh graduates for
fiscal 1997 for the first time since its 1992 creation through the
merger of Nippon Mining Co. and Kyodo Oil Co., the newspaper said.
     The move is part of Japan Energy's streamlining program to
eliminate 800 jobs from the current 4,100 by the end of fiscal 1997,
the paper said.
     Domestic oil wholesalers and refiners have faced intense
competition from cheaper imports following the April 1 repeal of a
law that confines gasoline imports virtually to refiners.
     Gasoline prices dropped sharply in Japan even before the law's
scrapping, cutting into the refiners' earnings.
     In fiscal 1995 ended in March, Nippon Oil, for example, posted
an operating loss for the first time in nine years.
     Cosmo Oil Co. and Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. earlier unveiled
similar streamlining plans.

Mistress hidden in Picasso masterpiece, scholar+

NARA, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     Hidden beneath a masterpiece of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso is
an image of a woman snuggling up with the man who appears in the oil
painting, an art scholar said Saturday.
     According to Sadatoshi Miura, director of scientific preservation
for the Tokyo national cultural assets study center, the 1923 painting
on display at Tokyo's Bridgestone Museum is considered to be a
self-portrait of Picasso (1881-1973).
     Miura used infrared video technology and computer analysis to
find the hidden picture of the woman underneath the painting titled
''Saltimbanque seated with arms crossed.''
     Miura will present his findings about the canvas Sunday at a
symposium of art preservation scholars, which started Saturday in the
city of Nara in western Japan.
     He took 20 images from the infrared camera and analyzed them
with computers to reach his conclusion.
     William Rubin, a Picasso scholar and former curator at the New
York Museum of Modern Art, said he believes the original painting of
the woman, which has remained hidden for more than 70 years, was of a
mistress of Picasso.
     Rubin said that during a three-week period in August 1923,
Picasso drew about 200 images of the mistress and she was a model for
about 40 of his oil paintings.  He added that in one of these
paintings, the face of the mistress supplanted that of Picasso's wife.
     Officials at the Bridgestone museum had no comment about the
findings but said the painting is currently on display, and to the
untrained eye it is impossible to tell if there is another work
hidden beneath the painting.

Red Army member holding forged Japanese passport+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     A Japanese woman believed to be a member of the Japanese Red
Army wanted by police for more than 20 years was holding a forged
Japanese passport when she was taken into police custody last
Saturday in Peru, sources close to Japanese security authorities said
Saturday.
     The National Police Agency has sent officials to Peru to confirm
the identity of the woman, who is believed to be Kazue Yoshimura, 49,
the sources said.
     Police are expected to prepare an arrest warrant on a charge of
using a forged official document, they added.
     She was detained by Peruvian authorities investigating terrorist
groups in the capital of Lima, the sources said.
     Yoshimura, a member of the Japanese Red Army accused of dozens
of international terrorist crimes, was put on an international wanted
list in 1975 for her alleged involvement in the 1974 seizure of the
French Embassy in the Netherlands.

Flood of new rice retailers riding deregulation wave+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     About 80,000 newly authorized rice retailers stormed into the
nation's deregulated rice distribution system Saturday, doubling the
number of rice retailers in Japan to 170,000, industry sources said.
     The newcomers were encouraged by the new food control law that
took effect the same day, which allows rice retail business by such
sectors as supermarket chains, fast food restaurants, convenience
stores and gas stations.
     One of the entrants to the market, Lawson Inc., a large
convenience store chain operator, started selling packaged rice
through its network of 5,700 retail outlets nationwide, the sources
said.
     Clerks at Lawson's Toranomon branch in downtown Tokyo were seen
hustling about the store setting up a display of the new goods
Saturday morning.
     While large-scale retailers are waging high-profile marketing
campaigns for their new rice sales business, smaller retailers are
limiting their efforts to telephone orders, the sources said.
     A shop in Tokyo's Ota Ward which previously sold primarily tofu
said it will focus on local newspaper ad inserts.
     A clerk at the shop said, ''Although we would like to sell
high-quality rice at lower prices, we feel restricted by our
relations with conventional rice retailers in the neighborhood,''
with whom the shop is entering competition for the first time.

Hashimoto calls on Israel to continue peace process+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Saturday he hopes the
election of Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli prime ministerial
election will not cause the Middle East peace process to regress.
     When asked by reporters to comment on Netanyahu's victory over
incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Hashimoto said ''The result
(of the election) is a judgment by the people of Israel, but I hope
that it will not reverse the Middle East peace process.''
     ''Because the percentages of votes were so close, I will watch
the formation of the new government very carefully,'' the premier
said in front of his official residence in Tokyo.
     Netanyahu, leader of the Likud Party, edged out Peres, a Nobel
Peace Prize laureate, 50.4% to 49.6% in Wednesday's
national election in Israel, the result of which was announced Friday.

21% of companies increase or resume dividend payments+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Reflecting signs of an economic recovery, an increasing number
of polled Japanese companies increased or resumed their dividend
payments for fiscal 1995 that ended March 31, a Kyodo News tally
showed Saturday.
     According to the tally, a combined 21.5% of 1,447 companies
which are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and closed their
books at the end of March increased or resumed their dividend
payments.  The figure represented a rise of 6.2 percentage points
from the previous year.
     Companies that increased payments accounted for 249 or 17.8%
while those that resumed payments came to 52 or 3.7%.
     In contrast, the ratio of companies which decreased or skipped
such payments fell by 0.8 percentage point from the previous year to
a combined 12.3%.
     Of those companies, 143 or 10.2% paid a smaller dividend while
30 or 2.1% passed a dividend.
     Other companies kept dividend payments unchanged from the
previous year or continued to skip the payments.
     By industry, pharmaceutical and chemical companies generally
paid larger dividends or resumed payments due to higher profits
stemming from rationalizing efforts.
     Pulp and paper makers also gave better dividend payments as
increased demand boosted prices, as did precision instrument makers,
owing to brisk sales of semiconductor-related products.
     On the other hand, many banks decreased or skipped payments due
to huge pretax losses to write off bad loans to failed ''jusen''
housing loan companies and other nonbank moneylenders.
     Construction companies also showed lower business results,
reflecting sluggish demand from the private sector.

88% of firms not paying during holidays for nursing+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     About 90% of polled companies that allow workers to take a leave
to take care of family members who need nursing care do not pay
employees during the period, a survey by a nonprofit institute showed
Saturday.
     The survey covered 2,190 listed companies and 366 unlisted
companies, with a combined 329 responding, the Institute of Labor
Administration said.
     According to the findings, companies that have introduced the
nursing-care leave system accounted for 52.6% of the total.
     By size, 79% of companies with 3,000 employees or more already
have such a system, followed by 56.5% for firms between 1,000 and
2,999 employees and a 33.1% of those with less than 1,000 workers.
     Of those that already have the system, only 2.3% of companies
pay a regular salary to the worker during the period while 8% do not
pay a salary but provide a special allowance.  Those that do not pay
anything amounted to 88.5%.
     All companies are obliged by law to introduce the system from
April 1999 but the law does not cover payments to workers.

China agrees to CTBT banning of all types of nuke tests+

GENEVA, June 1 Kyodo

     China has dropped its opposition to a proposal for a planned
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) that would ban all types
of nuclear explosions, Western negotiation sources said Saturday.
     The Chinese government has virtually given up its own proposal
that the CTBT allow ''peaceful nuclear explosions,'' the sources said.
     However, Beijing still wants the treaty to stipulate that the
issue of peaceful explosions will be discussed in a conference to
review the treaty 10 years after it goes into effect, they said.
     Participants in the nuclear test ban talks at the Geneva-based
Conference on Disarmament plan to draw up the treaty by the end of
this month and send it to the U.N. General Assembly for it to be
signed in September.
     Sha Zukang, China's ambassador to the Disarmament Conference,
said in May that China is ready to make compromises on its demand
that peaceful nuclear explosions should be exempt from the CTBT in
order to settle the issue as scheduled.
     Some nonnuclear states, including Japan and Canada, are
reportedly strongly opposed to referring to the term of peaceful
explosions in any form in the text of the treaty.
     Nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia are
discussing an alternative proposal of releasing a statement that the
issue will be discussed in a review conference, so that China will
not lose face, the sources said.

Regulations on foreign entertainers to be tightened+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The Justice Ministry will tighten regulations on foreign
entertainers and athletes performing in Japan to prevent them from
overstepping the bounds of their visas, ministry officials said
Saturday.
     The officials said a revision of the ordinance governing foreign
entertainers and professional athletes will be posted in their
official gazette Monday, effective Sept. 3 this year.
     Under the new regulations, foreign entertainers and professional
athletes will not be permitted to perform in Japan unless they are
licensed by their home governments or public organizations and have
majored in their areas of specialty at educational institutions in
their home countries for more than two years, the officials said.
     The existing ordinance requires them only to have more than two
years of experience in their home countries.
     As for organizations sponsoring their visits to Japan, the new
law stipulates that they must have no record of violating three
relevant laws governing immigration, prostitution and refugees, the
officials said.
     At present, organizations are allowed to sponsor foreign
entertainers and pro athletes if the organizations, their executives
and regular employees have not broken the law over the past three
years.
     The officials said regulations on cultural interchanges
subsidized by central and local governments and public organizations
will be eased.
     The officials said the ministry decided to tighten the
regulations in light of a growing number of foreign entertainers in
Japan working in fields not permitted by their visas, such as working
at clubs as hostesses.
     Of about 60,000 foreign entertainers who entered Japan in 1995,
12,200, mostly Philippine nationals, overstayed their visas, they
said.

Ministry to review dioxine control guideline+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The Health and Welfare Ministry has decided to review the
existing guideline for combating highly toxic dioxine for the first
time in five years, ministry officials said Saturday.
     The officials said the ministry was alarmed by reports that high
levels of the chemical have been detected in the air and soil near
garbage incinerators in recent years.
     The organic chlorine-based chemical, which is said to cause
cancer and birth defects, is contained in insecticides, bleaching
agents and ash recovered from garbage incinerators.  It is also used
in a defoliant.
     The officials said the chemical has even been detected in
drinking water and in breast milk.
     The officials said pollution was notable in areas where
small-capacity incinerators are currently in operation.
     The existing guideline set in December 1990 aims to limit the
tolerable level of dioxine discharged from garbage incinerators at
about 0.5 nanogram.  A nanogram is a billionth of a gram.
     The guideline, however, has come under criticism from
environmental groups because it applies only to about a dozen
large-scale incinerators in Japan which operate around the clock.
     Experiments at pollution research institutes in Kyoto and Hyogo
prefectures in western Japan said a greater amount of dioxine is
created in small-scale incinerators where temperatures in the furnace
are stable and combustion tends to be imperfect.
     The new guideline will be worked out by an expert panel formed
by the ministry in mid-May.
     The ministry officials said the tolerable level will be lowered
to less than 0.1 nanogram for large-scale incinerators, the same
level set in Germany and the Netherlands.
     Discussions by the panel will focus on the ceiling for obsolete
and small-scale incinerators, the officials said.

Hashimoto, Kim vow cooperation in co-hosting World Cup+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and South Korean
President Kim Young Sam on Saturday pledged full support from their
governments for the 2002 soccer World Cup finals which will be hosted
jointly by the two nations.
     Japanese officials said Hashimoto and Kim reached agreement on
mutual cooperation during talks over the telephone Saturday afternoon.
     The two leaders agreed that co-hosting will provide an
opportunity for the two countries to shape a ''future-oriented
relationship'' between them, a Japanese official said.
     Hashimoto and Kim made the pledge a day after soccer's world
governing body FIFA awarded the 2002 World Cup, the first to be held
in Asia, jointly to the two Asian neighbors.
     Hashimoto told Kim that Japan is determined to cooperate with
South Korea and make the 2002 tournament, to be contested by 32
nations, ''an example to the world.''
     Kim replied he was all for it, Japanese officials said.
     Japanese officials said Kim initiated the telephone call, an
indication that the Korean leader is eager to use the occasion to
erase the bitter rivalry which had engulfed the two countries during
the bidding process.
     Earlier in the day, Hashimoto told reporters that his government
will give its full backing to the co-hosting plan.
     ''There are areas where naturally the government has a role to
play, like (the issue of) passports,'' Hashimoto said.
     The 2002 World Cup will mark the first time that the tournament
will be co-hosted by two nations.
     Japan had vigorously opposed co-hosting the World Cup with South
Korea prior to FIFA's decision Friday but Hashimoto suggested
Saturday political considerations had prevented the government from
speaking out for joint hosting.
     ''It is wrong for politics to stay in front of sports,'' he said.
     The FIFA decision to split the 64-match tournament between Japan
and South Korea has brought anxiety and unease among the 15 Japanese
cities competing to get part of the World Cup action.
     Celebrations that had been scheduled in most of the candidate
cities if Japan had won the sole right to host the World Cup were
canceled.
     ''I feel like I suddenly lost enthusiasm.  Children who were
looking forward to attending the celebration were disappointed,''
said an official in Sapporo, northern Japan, which called off a
celebration scheduled at Atsubetsu Park stadium.
     Ceremonies scheduled in Hiroshima, Kobe and Aomori, northeastern
Japan, were also canceled.
     However, in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture in central Japan, municipal
officials decided to go ahead with their ceremony in a show of
sportsmanship.
     Hisashi Fukuoka, one of the ceremony's organizers, said, ''It's
good that Japan and South Korea will co-host the World Cup.''
     In Oita, southwestern Japan, prefectural officials also decided
to go ahead with their festivities.  One official said, ''South
Korean players are doing well for our local team and Oita is the only
candidate city in Kyushu, so we want to take a positive view of the
co-hosting plan.''

Casual wear popular as present for Father's Day+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Casual wear like polo shirts and jackets are replacing neckties
as popular presents for Father's Day on June 16, reflecting the
recent boom in outdoor activities and ''casual Fridays,'' department
store and super market officials said Saturday.
     Seibu Department Stores Ltd.'s Ikebukuro store in Tokyo is
selling about 200 styles of polo shirts with those priced at between
7,800 yen and 9,800 yen selling well, officials said.
     At Mitsukoshi Ltd.'s Nihombashi store in Tokyo, polo shirts and
sweaters are also good sellers, officials said.
     The store is providing customers who buy a sweater with a free
service in which the salesclerk takes a picture of the customer, with
the sweater together with the picture and a message sent to the
father, they said.
     The store has also introduced information on items suitable as
presents on the Internet personal computer network, they added.
     Supermarket chain operator Seiyu Ltd. has also established a
special corner to sell such items in its larger stores.
     Polo shirts priced between 3,000 yen and 5,000 yen are popular,
Seiyu officials said.
     The company will present by lot personal handy-phone system
(PHS) sets to customers who buy men's items worth more than 20,000
yen at its stores, they said.
     ''Flashy designed neckties and belts were main sellers in the
days of the 'bubble' economy.  But recently, customers are turning
their appetite to polo shirts and other casual items, seeking better
goods at cheaper prices,'' said the Seiyu officials.

Miyamoto flatly denies alleged takeover bid against Ascii+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Square Co. owner Masafumi Miyamoto on Saturday categorically
denied allegations that he had instigated a hostile takeover bid
against Ascii Corp.
     The denial follows remarks made at a news conference Thursday by
Ascii President Kazuhiko Nishi that four board members of the major
personal computer and video game software maker have tendered their
resignations because of their involvement in an abortive attempt to
take over the company.
     Ascii and Square, both based in Tokyo, are locked in fierce
rivalry in the computer game software market.
     The takeover attempt was alleged to have been masterminded by
Miyamoto, according to press reports published earlier this week.
     At the news conference Thursday, Nishi declined to confirm the
allegation, saying he was indirectly told that the mastermind is set
to file a libel suit if his name is made public.
     Miyamoto said Saturday, ''I was being made out to be a bad guy in
the latest takeover bid drama that had been written and played by
Nishi alone.''
     ''The resignations of the four board members can be viewed as a
move to restore democracy in Ascii which is run autocratically by
Nishi,'' said Miyamoto.
     The latest stir was touched off when the former executives
refused to affix their seals on a ''ringisho'' proposal on a 1.34
billion yen loan to an Ascii subsidiary made by Nishi on the grounds
it is dubious to extend such a loan to the unit, according to
Miyamoto.
     Asked for cooperation by them, Miyamoto, at one stage, had made
up his mind to help them leave the company and set up a new software
publishing house, he said.   But he did not do so, concerned that
such cooperation would spur the flight of Ascii employees to the new
firm, thus throwing Ascii into confusion, Miyamoto said.
     He instead proposed to the Industrial Bank of Japan, Ascii's
main bank, that Nishi step aside to the post of chairman and that
Ascii limit Nishi-proposed business diversification and promote
restructuring, Miyamoto said.
     Miyamoto also suggested that he is ready to buy, if necessary,
new shares if Ascii issues them for allotment to a third party in
order to avoid its net liabilities, he said.
     These proposals were taken by Nishi as an attempt to take over
his company with its executives, Miyamoto said.
     Miyamoto said he explained the restructuring plan to Nishi in
their meeting at a Tokyo hotel in late May but that Nishi rejected
it, saying there is no reason for anyone outside of the company to
meddle in its affairs.

Yeltsin to attend politico-economic talks at G-7 summit+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Russian President Boris Yeltsin will attend for the first time a
newly created politico-economic forum at the Lyons summit of the
Group of Seven (G-7) nations in France later this month, Foreign
Ministry sources said Saturday.
     The sources said the forum will be an arena for comprehensive
discussions on problems such as employment, poverty and free trade
which require both political and economic approaches.
     Yeltsin's presence also is designed to support his bid for
reelection as Russian president because he faces a strong challenge
from Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, they said.
     The leaders of the seven countries have agreed to rally behind
Yeltsin's reelection bid, and the June 27-29 summit is highly likely
to be held before an expected final showdown vote between Yeltsin and
Zyuganov in the presidential election, the sources said.
     The first round of Russian balloting is scheduled for June 16.
     The seven G-7 countries are Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States.
     The sources said leaders of the seven nations will discuss a
Russian request for the membership in the Paris Club, a group of
major creditor nations, with a positive approach.
     They said the agenda for the politico-economic discussions will
include topics of a political nature which were incorporated in an
economic declaration issued at the previous summit held in Halifax,
Canada, last year, and those which require politico-economic
approaches.
     A formal agenda is being prepared at presummit meetings attended
by representatives of the seven nations and Russian Economic Minister
Yevgeny Yasin, the sources said.
     Specific subjects being considered for the agenda include
environmental problems and barriers to development, such as natural
disasters, safety of atomic power generation, intellectual property
and approaches to cope with expanding information society, they said.
     The sources said discussions in the new forum will help Russia
and former socialist nations promote transition to a market economy
and free trade.
     Russia will be kept from joining discussions on foreign exchange
and monetary policy coordination as in the past, and Yeltsin's
presence will not lead to expansion of the G-7 into the Group of 8,
they added.

Hatoyama questions moving U.S. bases in Okinawa+

NAHA, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     A ruling coalition leader Saturday questioned the advisability
of a plan to move the U.S. Futemma air base on Okinawa Prefecture to
the site of an ammunition depot nearby.
     Yukio Hatoyama, a senior representative of New Party Sakigake,
the smallest partner of the three-party coalition, told a group of
voters in Naha that the planned relocation will damage the natural
environment of the area where the ammunition depot is located.
     Hatoyama was in Naha, the capital of Okinawa, Japan's
southernmost island prefecture, to support the party's candidate who
is running in an election for the prefectural assembly.
     In April, the United States agreed to return the Futemma
airfield site and relocate its functions to the site of the depot or
another location.
     He said the question involving U.S. military bases in the
prefecture should be considered by taking environmental problems into
the account, citing reports that high levels of harmful substances
such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl were detected in a
sewage disposal storage at the former site of a U.S. communication
facility.
     He called on voters to continue checking environmental pollution
near U.S. military bases.

Landowners to seek compensation after U.S. base return+

NAHA, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     Local landowners of the U.S. Futemma Air Station in Okinawa
Prefecture said Saturday they will demand that the central government
make ''proper use'' of the base and pay compensation to them after it
is returned by the U.S. military under a bilateral accord.
     A group of landowners in Ginowan in the island prefecture, who
are leasing land to the U.S. military, decided at a rally to lobby
the central and local governments in seeking the measures.
     The rally was held because some landowners of the Futemma base
have expressed opposition to the return of the base as they presently
depend upon government fees for leasing their land to the U.S.
military.
     About 2,100 members, or three-fourths of the group's total, own
land at the Futemma Air Station.
     The United States agreed in April to return the Futemma base in
Ginowan to local landowners within five to seven years as part of
plans to scale down U.S. military facilities on Japan's southernmost
island.
     Seizen Hanashiro, chairman of the group, told some 500
participants that he would do his utmost to realize government
compensation to landowners and the promotion of ''proper use'' of the
base.

Ex-Premier Hata threatens to leave opposition party+

KUSHIRO, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     Former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata hinted Saturday that he might
leave opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) unless intraparty
reforms make headway.
     ''It is possible that I will take new political action unless
the party makes resolute efforts to rebuild it to meet the people's
expectations,'' Hata said in a speech and a news conference at a
Kushiro hotel in northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido.
     He made the remark when asked about the possibility that he
might leave the party and join Hajime Funada, former acting chairman
of Shinshinto's general affairs council, in organizing a new group.
     Funada, former Economic Planning Agency chief, has repeatedly
expressed his intention to form a new party with Yukio Hatoyama,
secretary general of New Party Sakigake, the smallest party of the
tripartite ruling coalition.
     Hata, however, said he will stay in the party for the time being
to contribute to the promotion of the party's reforms.

Stocks expected to continue to be mixed next week++

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Stocks are expected to continue to be mixed in Tokyo next week,
as shares are expected to be sandwiched between selling on rallies
and bargain hunting by public funds and investment trusts.
     It will be hard for the barometer Nikkei Stock Average to stay
above the 22,000 line because an increasing number of market players
are ready to take profits above that mark, traders said.
     Given the expansion of the outstanding balance of
arbitrage-linked buying, anxiety about possible selling to unwind
arbitrage positions is also depressing investor confidence, they said.
     At the same time, shares will be supported at the bottom because
public funds, such as ''kampo'' postal life insurance money, and
investment trusts might buy shares on dips, they said.
     Ahead of the release of the Bank of Japan's ''Tankan'' quarterly
business sentiment survey late next week, a cautious mood might
prevail, with the Nikkei average hovering around 22,000.
     Domestic financial institutions and other market players are
expected to move to sell shares on rallies if the benchmark Nikkei
average breaks through the 22,000 line, they said.
     They also said market players are worried about possible
arbitrage unwinding ahead of the June 14 special quotations (SQ) day
for futures and options trading on June contracts.
     ''Fears of heavy arbitrage-related selling ahead of the SQ day
will continue to linger in the market,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general
manager for equities operations at Nikko Securities Co.
     Therefore, substantial gains cannot be expected, he said, but
shares will be solid at the bottom due to expected buying by
investment trusts, public funds and pension funds.
     About 15 investment trusts were set up this past week, into
which up to 366 billion yen worth of stocks will be included, so
buying by those investment trusts is expected, he said.
     Given the expected tug-of-war between anxieties ahead of the SQ
day and bargain hunting by such players as investment trusts, the
Nikkei average will hover around 22,000, Ueki said.
     However, Kazuyuki Suzuki, manager for equities trading at Daiwa
Securities Co., is more positive.  ''The correction phase is over and
the Nikkei average could challenge 22,500,'' he said.
     As traders have been rolling over the June contract of
Nikkei-225 futures to the September contract, it will be unnecessary
to worry about arbitrage-linked selling ahead of the SQ day, he said.
     In the absence of other leadership, incentive-backed speculative
stocks have led activity for the past several weeks, which has
contributed to the dull movement of the overall market.
     But, Suzuki said, ''After speculative favorites tumbled Friday,
major high-technology and telecommunications issues, including DDI,
are likely to become stellar performers.''
     This is attributable to reduced fears of lower prices of
semiconductor chips, following the announcement by Samsung
Electronics of South Korea that it will cut its chip output by 15%.
     Market players said they will pay attention to the Bank of
Japan's ''Tankan'' quarterly survey of business sentiment, due for
release Friday, as a clue to the direction of interest rates.
     The Nikkei average closed this past week at 21,956.19, up 157.76
points, or 0.72%, from the close of the previous week, when the index
suffered a 0.54% loss.
     On the Tokyo market's first section, trading became less active
with the average daily volume at 387.84 million shares, down 2.73
million shares from the preceding week's average.
     Trading house Kanematsu Corp. was the most actively traded stock,
with a volume of 73.09 million shares.  Its price closed this past
week at 700 yen, up 40 yen from a week earlier.
     Kobe Steel, a major steelmaker based in the western Japan port
city of Kobe, ranked second with a volume standing at 32.05 million
shares.  Its price declined 8 yen to 298 yen.
     The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, the nation's leading commercial
bank reborn from a merger in April, ranked third with a volume of
27.05 million shares.  Its price went up 90 yen to 2,560 yen.
     Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank ranked fourth with a volume of 26.94
million shares.  Its price was flat at 1,950 yen.  Nippon Steel
ranked fifth with 20.72 million shares.  Its price fell 2 yen to 367
yen.
     In terms of trading volume, the five stocks were followed by
condominium builder Daikyo, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries, Nagasakiya and Fuji Heavy Industries.

Dollar expected to remain firm against yen in Tokyo++

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The U.S. dollar is likely to hold firm against the yen in Tokyo
next week under the ongoing influence of Friday's comment by Japan's
top cabinet spokesman in favor of continuing low domestic interest
rates.
     Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said at a press
conference that, given the current economic situation, Japan's low
interest rate policy should be continued.
     The dollar is expected to move in the 107.00-109.50 yen range
next week, dealers said.
     ''Kajiyama's remark strengthens views that the Bank of Japan
(BOJ) will keep the official discount rate at the record low 0.5% for
the time being,'' said Nobuo Kihara, customer dealer at the foreign
exchange division of Banque Paribas in Tokyo.
     With the differential between U.S. and Japanese interest rates
remaining relatively large, the dollar's attractiveness can be
maintained, Kihara said.
     Prospects of higher Japanese interest rates were also dampened
by a series of slack domestic economic data, dealers said.
     In particular, the diffusion index of leading economic
indicators for March, released Tuesday by the Economic Planning
Agency, slipped below the 50% ''boom or bust'' line in the reporting
month for the first time in six months.
     The weak economic figures reflect the fragility of the fledgling
economic recovery in Japan, the dealers said.
     The market focus has now shifted to next Friday's release of the
central bank's ''Tankan'' quarterly survey of business confidence for
further clues on the development of Japan's economy, they said.
     The recent strengthening of the Australian dollar against the
yen is also supportive of the U.S. currency's downside against the
yen, said Kihara at Banque Paribas.
     Japanese individuals apparently continue to invest through the
nation's securities brokerages in high-yielding Australian
currency-denominated financial assets, Kihara said.
     The brokerages are believed to be underwriting large amounts of
Australian bonds to be issued ahead of Japan's summer bonus season,
in order to sell the bonds to such individuals.
     The continued rise of the U.S currency against the yen, however,
will be countered by mounting concerns over U.S. securities markets,
said Yoshiki Hamada, senior manager at the treasury trading
department of Asahi Bank.
     Both the key Dow Jones industrial average and U.S. government
bond prices are likely to continue to face downward pressure, due to
the favorable economic growth in that nation, Hamada said.
     This is because fears persist that inflationary pressure could
emerge in the U.S. economy in the near future, Hamada said.  In
theory, inflation should undermine the dollar's value.
     Market players are waiting for the announcement of U.S. nonfarm
payrolls for May, scheduled for next Friday, for further hints of
future trends in the nation's interest rates, dealers said.
     If the economic data turn out stronger than expected, it could
provide a significant boost to U.S. interest rates, they said.
     In Tokyo this past week, the U.S. currency hovered in a narrow
range between 107.60 yen and 108.93 yen.

Short-term money rates expected to weaken next week++

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Short-term money market rates are expected to weaken in Tokyo
next week under the continuing influence of Friday's comment by
Japan's top cabinet spokesman favoring low interest rates.
     Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said at a press
conference that, given the current economic situation, Japan's low
interest rate policy should be continued.
     Kajiyama's remark reenforced the view that the Bank of Japan
(BOJ) will maintain the official discount rate at the current record
low 0.5% for a while to boost the economy, money brokers said.
     In interbank trading, the key unsecured overnight call money
rate is forecast to trade between 0.45% and 0.50%, compared with late
Friday's 0.49%, they said.
     On the open market, the rate on key three-month certificates of
deposit (CDs) issued by commercial banks will hover in the 0.53-0.58%
range, compared with late Friday's 0.56%, they said.
     Market players will be focusing on the release of the central
bank's ''Tankan'' quarterly survey of business confidence, due out
next Friday, for further hints of future developments in interest
rates, they noted.
     If the economic data turn out to be weaker than expected, this
should put significant downward pressure on interest rates, they said.

Sensitive trading seen on Tokyo bond market next week++

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Sensitive trading is expected in Japanese government bonds in
Tokyo next week ahead of Friday's release of the Bank of Japan's
''Tankan'' quarterly survey of business sentiment.
     Bond prices could fluctuate wildly, traders said, due to
speculation about the key survey, conducted in May, which is seen as
a clue to the future direction of domestic interest rates.
     There is less risk of bond prices falling, as fears of higher
interest rates have weakened, but substantial gains cannot be
expected ahead of the release of the Tankan report, they said.
     However, there are signs that investors, who retreated to the
sidelines in recent sessions, may try to bring bond prices higher,
the traders said.
     The yield on the No. 182 cash bond fell 0.06 percentage point
during this past week to 3.160%, while the key September contract
increased 0.40 point to 118.90.
     As the prediction for the industrial output index for June came
in weaker than expected, bond prices remained steady in this past
week.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama's remark supporting
the current low interest rate policy also helped support bond prices.

Clinton renews MFN status for China+

WASHINGTON, May 31 Kyodo

     President Bill Clinton formally extended China's
most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status Friday for another year,
calling it ''the best way'' to advance U.S. economic and security
interests in Asia under his ''engagement'' policy toward Beijing.
     The announcement was anticipated as the president declared his
intention earlier this month to renew the status for allowing China
the lowest tariffs the United States imposes on its trading partners.
     ''The president has taken this step because he believes that
continued engagement with China is the best way to help it become a
constructive force for stability and prosperity in Asia and to
advance important American interests,'' the White House said in a
statement.
     Clinton's decision was immediately relayed in a letter to
Congress, thus setting the stage for debate with legislators opposing
the unconditional renewal of China's MFN status amid lingering
concerns over Beijing's human rights, weapons proliferation, trade,
Taiwan and other issues.
     Under the MFN procedures, Congress has until July 3 to introduce
a resolution to reject the president's decision or until Aug. 31 to
approve it.  Clinton has the authority to veto the resolution.
     The MFN extension came as another step in the complicated zigzag
approach taken recently by the Clinton administration toward China.
     Washington and Beijing on May 15 announced tit-for-tat lists of
sanctions they would impose upon each other if the dispute over the
February 1995 bilateral agreement on intellectual property rights
remains unresolved June 17.  The two nations are to resume talks
next week.
     Shortly before announcing the sanctions list, the U.S. decided
not to impose sanctions over China's alleged sale of nuclear weapons
technology to Pakistan after Beijing gave assurance it would prevent
such exports in the future.
     Addressing these issues, the White House statement said revoking
the MFN status ''would effectively sever our economic relationship
with China, undermining our capacity to influence China in a broad
range of areas, including human rights, nonproliferation, trade,
Taiwan relations and others.''
     But it said, ''Engagement with China does not mean acquiescence
to Chinese policies or practices we oppose.''
     ''Far from giving China a special deal, renewal of MFN confers
on it a trading status equal to that enjoyed by most other nations.
Simply put, it gives China normal trade status.  It is not being
granted as a favor to China,'' the statement said.
     ''The president has demonstrated that he is prepared to use
sanctions and other means at his disposal to promote America's goals
regarding China, whether it is protecting U.S. intellectual property,
deterring dangerous (weapons) proliferation or promoting human
rights,'' the statement said.  ''These are the right tools to use in
advancing U.S. interests.''
     In 1994, Clinton adopted a policy of unlinking Beijing's human
rights situation from the MFN issue.
     The statement also said MFN revocation ''would not advance
the interests of Taiwan or Hong Kong'' because the two economies ''are
enormously dependent on continued trade between the U.S. and China.''

Asian editorial excerpts+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Excerpts of selected editorials carried by Asia-Pacific
newspapers in the latest week:
     Defecting N. Korean Pilot's Testimony (The Korea Times, Seoul):
     We often hear that communist North Korea is busy preparing for
war against the South.  But our particular attention was drawn to
press remarks by the defecting North Korean air force Capt. Lee Chol
Su that Pyongyang is poised to attack the South and to defeat it in
one week.
     It appears that a positive, serious assessment is needed of the
war plan claimed by the North Korean defector, as the pilot is likely
to have had access to up-to-date information on changes in North
Korean plans to invade the South, and an attack is more likely to be
a surprise one than not.
     At the same time, Lee's remarks appear to chime in with other
evidence, indicating a need to go onto a national alert against the
communists in the North, who have never abandoned their belligerent
plan to take over the South militarily.
     We are obliged to note that the shocking war scenario envisages
Seoul being seized in 24 hours, Taejon in the next couple of days and
Pusan and all the rest of the country in seven days.  In preparation
for the three-stage war plan, 270 fighters have been or are being
deployed in forward positions for a surprise attack, according to Lee.
     This war plan information and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's
continued warmongering behoove us to take all necessary
countermeasures and to tighten the discipline of governmental and
nongovernmental organizations and strengthen overall state of
vigilance against the North.
(May 30)
     Dangerous for nations to ignore yen debts (Nation, Bangkok):
     Japan takes great pride in being the world's largest donor
nation, and boasts as well that its development aid policies have
contributed in a big way to the rapid economic growth of Southeast
Asia.
     But while Japan is due some applause for maintaining its
comparatively high level of official development assistance (ODA), a
less considered phenomenon is the debt accrued by recipient countries
-- especially when seen against a strong yen.
     Of total Japanese bilateral credit, around 60% is loaned to East
and Southeast Asian countries.  The increasing indebtedness to Japan
is reflected in the rise in their yen-donominated long-term debt.
     The Japanese yen started to appreciate in value against the U.S.
dollar in the second half of the 1980s.  This trend became more
dramatic in the 1990s.
     Whether on the force of the market or through directed policy,
an appreciation of the Japanese yen was forthcoming.
     Ironically, many countries heavily indebted to Japan turn a
blind eye to the yen appreciation's real effect on their
indebtedness.  This is primarily because of the importance of Japan
in crucial areas of their economies.
     But borrower nations have to be aware that an appreciated yen
would impact negatively on their balance of payments situation.
Also, the additional cost of projects financed by Japanese loans that
result from the yen appreciation put to question the economic
viability of individual projects since the appreciation can result in
serious long-term losses.
     However, to simply ignore the impact of the yen appreciation on
national budgets as well as the economic viability of projects
financed by Japanese loans, would be foolhardy for its bears serious
implications on priority, equity and development questions among
debtor countries.
     A more detailed review of the impact of yen appreciation on
specific countries is thus in order.  When this is done, the next
step will be to find mechanism through which Japan can share part of
the costs of the yen appreciation to the debtor country.
     Such a gesture may seem magnanimous, but it is in the interest
of Japan and other creditor nations that debt service repayments do
not become so much of a burden that they threatens the economic and
social stability of recipient nations.
(May 26)
     Donors only in name? (Business Times, Kuala Lumpur):
     Some Western countries in the International Labor Organization
(ILO) are good at making verbal pledges but not necessarily as good
when it comes to honoring them.  The United Nations, the
International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank are just
some of the agencies that are facing financial crisis because certain
countries will not pay their dues.
     Developed countries' commitment at the Rio (de Janeiro) Earth
Summit have also yet to be met and the importance that they once
attached on development aid and generalized system of preferences is
declining rapidly.
     Yet, these are the same countries that try to dominate the
process in the ILO and in its governing body.  When Malaysia voiced
its views that the ILO should be ''more representative'' of
developing countries' views, it was seen as a nuisance.
     Malaysia has been a member of the ILO since 1957 and has
ratified a fair number of its conventions and recommendations, which
sometimes suggest that the world body lacks empathy for the realities
in developing and least-developed countries but, generally, the ILO
has been involved in measures that are aimed to help improve workers'
lot and improved their rights.
     In this regard, we would not want the ILO to go under just
because some developed countries are not paying their dues.  Perhaps,
the relatively poor countries like Malaysia will have to contribute
more.  But if that is the case, we should have our fair share of say
in the ILO and in the recommendations and conventions that the body
adopts.  At the same time, the ILO will have to learn to be
economical and trim its expenses.
(May 30)

U.S. pondering more food aid to N. Korea+

WASHINGTON, May 31 Kyodo

     The United States is about to decide on whether to provide
additional food aid to North Korea, which is suffering a serious food
shortage since the heavy flooding of last summer, an administration
official said Friday.
     ''There is a positive inclination'' toward further humanitarian
aid, the official said, noting that Washington sees the North Koreans
as near the brink of starvation.
     ''The issue is under active consideration,'' the official told
Kyodo News.
     In February, Washington decided to extend 2 million dollars
worth of humanitarian assistance to North Korea through a U.N.
program for flood-related relief, brushing aside the cautious
approach taken by Japan and South Korea over further aid.
     The February decision came on top of a 225,000 dollar
contribution made last year.
     During a trilateral subcabinet-level meeting May 14, the U.S.
agreed with Japan and South Korea not to extend further food aid to
North Korea for the time being.
     But U.S. sources said South Korea, which has been less positive
about providing food aid before North Korea agrees to the proposed
four-way peace talks on the Korean Peninsula, has begun to soften its
position on further aid.
     U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young
Sam in April proposed talks among the U.S., China, and North and
South Korea to negotiate toward a peace accord for the divided
peninsula.
     Against this backdrop, the international community, including
the U.S. and South Korea, may decide in favor of additional food aid
to Pyongyang, taking advantage of a soon-to-be announced emergency
appeal for such aid by the U.N. Department of Humanitarian
Assistance, the sources said.
     In Rome, the home of the U.N. World Food Program,
representatives of the governments involved discussed Thursday how
much additional aid could be provided.

Kim Jong Il likely to emerge from isolation soon+

WASHINGTON, May 31 Kyodo

     North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is expected to emerge from
isolation and his control should become ''more public'' later this
year, U.S. congressman Bill Richardson said Friday.
     ''Kim Jong Il is in control, and I think this will be made more
public later in the year,'' Richardson told a press conference held
to discuss his recent three-day visit to North Korea.
     ''I'm not firmly convinced, but I saw a lot of signs, media and
otherwise and in discussions with officials, that he will be emerging
from his isolation,'' said Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico.
     ''I think this is positive because that's a civilian leadership,
and it is encouraging for the West because I think there is a
pragmatic streak in those that operate ministries like foreign
relations,'' he said.
     Kim has been considered the de facto leader of North Korea since
the death in July 1994 of his father Kim Il Sung, who headed the
northern half of the Korean Peninsula since its founding in 1948.
     But he has yet to formally assume the nation's top two posts --
state president and general secretary of the Workers Party of Korea.
     This, along with rarity of his public appearances, has sparked
various speculation about the condition of his health and the
possibility of an internal power struggle.
     But Richardson said, ''On the positive side that I saw, the
civilian leadership of North Korea seems to be stronger...I believe
now that through the Foreign Ministry, specifically Vice Minister
Kang Sok Ju who I dealt with, there is strong impressive leadership
that is more moderate and pragmatic.''
     As for conflict with South Korea, Richardson said North Korean
officials ''were more conciliatory toward South Korea than in the
past.  They were more positive.  They have wide differences, but some
of the hostility that I saw before was absent.
     Richardson said the United States, South Korea, Japan and other
nations should help North Korea with its current food shortage to
open the way for Pyongyang to move ahead with dialogue, especially on
the proposed four-way talks for a permanent peace agreement to
replace the current truce accord on the divided peninsula.
     U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young
Sam proposed the quadrilateral talks among North and South Korea,
China, and the U.S.
     ''I think this is a good juncture to move with some type of
positive engagement with North Korea, and I think the food and
humanitarian assistance is the key,'' Richardson said.
     The additional food aid ''should be done immediately,'' he said.
''I think the situation is very grave.  I didn't see famine, but
close to it.''
     ''We should provide food assistance on a humanitarian basis,
and I believe that will trigger some positive responses on their
part'' on the proposed four-way talks, Richardson said, noting that
he has made ''this recommendation'' to the White House and Congress.
     North Korea has yet to offer its response to the proposed talks,
but it ''did not eliminate the possibility of participating,''
Richardson said.  ''That is still an option.''
     He added that Pyongyang wants more details such as the venue,
the agenda, and the level of the proposed talks.

Toyota Tianjin venture holds opening reception+

TIANJIN, China, June 1 Kyodo

     A newly established joint engine venture between Toyota Motor
Corp. and its Chinese partner held an opening reception in Tianjin on
Saturday in a move expected to accelerate the Japanese automaker's
full-scale Chinese operations.
     Toyota President Hiroshi Okuda and some 10 executives of
Japanese auto parts makers in the Toyota group attended the ceremony
for the equally owned Tianjin Toyota Motor Engine Co., which was set
up in the Chinese city in mid-May with a capital of 248 million
dollars.
     It marks the first time for Toyota, Japan's biggest automaker, to
establish production of such a key auto component in China.
     The new company will manufacture 1.3-liter engines from early
1998 at an annual pace of 150,000 units, Toyota officials said.
     Most of the engines will be installed in the Charade passenger
cars which the Chinese partner, Tianjin Automobile Industrial (Group)
Co., manufactures with the backing of Daihatsu Motor Co., a Japanese
automaker in the Toyota group, the officials said.
     Some of the engines will be exported, the officials said.
     They said the new company is considering producing 1.6-liter and
1.8-liter engines for use in the Corona passenger car.
     Tianjin Automobile is one of China's eight major auto groups.
     Toyota also established a joint company with Tianjin Automobile
in December last year to manufacture drive trains.
     Toyota is the latest major Japanese automaker that has acquired
Chinese government approval to produce vehicle engines in a joint
venture with a Chinese concern.
     Already, Honda Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. have
received the go-ahead.
     But industry analysts say Japanese automakers, notably big ones,
will face an uphill battle against their U.S. and European
competitors in the vast Chinese market with a population of 1.2
billion as they are far behind in entering the China market.
     Volkswagen AG of Germany, which entered the Chinese market as
early as the 1980s, now holds a dominant position, with its joint car
production ventures with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. and
another venture with a carmaker based in Jilin Province, northeastern
China, performing steadily.
     Chrysler Corp. of the U.S. and the French maker of Citroen and
Peugeot cars have consolidated their footholds in China, while
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., both U.S. firms, have
reached the point where they will be able to find joint-venture
partners in Shanghai and Nanjing, respectively, in the near future.
     Among Japanese carmakers, Suzuki Motor Corp. is turning out
minicars in the city of Changan, Shaanxi Province, central China, in
a joint venture with a Chinese concern.
     Daihatsu Motor Co. of the Toyota group and Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd. are extending technological cooperation for vehicle production.
     But Japanese auto giants have yet to acquire a stake in car
production ventures in China.
     This stems largely from the judgment they made in the 1980s that
it was still premature to enter the Chinese car market, analysts say.
     In an automotive industry policy unveiled in 1994, the Chinese
government called for combining a number of automobile enterprises
into eight major groups in an effort to develop the sector into the
nation's key industry.
     Assuming that motor vehicle demand in China will grow by 8 to 9%
a year until 2010, the government established rules for the
introduction of foreign capital for car production.
     Flocking foreign carmakers, however, have made the Chinese car
market a ''seller's market'' where the Chinese are able to strike
favorable deals for themselves with foreign makers, analysts say.
     In the latest deal with Tianjin Automobile, Toyota appears to
have had little choice but to accept unfavorable terms in order not
to lose the deal, industry sources said.

MITI to promote environmental equipment market in Asia+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and 12
companies have jointly launched a full-scale study of how best to
nurture markets for environment-related equipment in developing
countries in Asia, according to ministry officials.
     The move represents an upgrading of the Green Aid Plan initiated
in 1992 with the aim of transferring environment-friendly
technologies to such countries.
     MITI plans to draw up a plan by this fall and will earmark funds
from the nation's official development assistance (ODA) for specific
projects, the officials said.
     Asian developing economies are increasingly concerned that
environmental degradation will put a dent in their economic growth,
analysts say.  But they are giving priority to improving social
infrastructure through the construction of such facilities as
electric power plants, highways and railroads.
     These countries thus lag far behind industrialized nations in
environmental protection measures, they said.
     MITI intends to help expand the overseas operations of
environment-related businesses while striving to check the
cross-border spread of pollution such as acid rain, the officials
said.
     The 12 companies involved in the study include Nippon Steel
Corp., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Ebara Corp. and Chiyoda Corp.
     A joint study panel of MITI and these companies will consider
ways to promote the application of low-cost technologies which
protect the environment and foster environment-friendly industries
through joint ventures with Japanese businesses, the officials said.
     Under the Green Aid Plan, which covered six Asian countries, MITI
and participating companies installed desulfurization equipment in
two electric power plants in China.
     In addition, they developed an exhaust heat recovery system for
use at a cement plant in the Philippines.

China-Taiwan trade up 2.9% in 1st qtr+

HONG KONG, June 1 Kyodo

     Merchandise trade between China and Taiwan for the first quarter
of this year rose 2.9% from a year earlier to 4.84 billion U.S.
dollars, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported Saturday.
     The figure was released Friday by Taiwan's Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the news agency said.
     The ministry attributed the low growth in the value of the
two-way trade in part to a rate cut in China's tax refund on its
exports as well as to recent tensions between Beijing and Taipei, it
said.
     Taiwan's trade with China accounted for 9.3% of the total value
of its foreign trade, it said.
     Trade between China and Taiwan was especially sluggish in March
when China conducted a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait,
dropping 5.8% from the same month last year to 1.63 billion dollars,
it said.
     Taiwan's exports to China came to 4.13 billion dollars in the
January-March period, up 3.7% from a year earlier, while its imports
from China fell 1.7% to 708 million dollars, leaving Taiwan with a
trade surplus of more than 3.4 billion dollars, the ministry was
quoted as saying.

Mongolian fire fighters have tough road: journalist+

SAPPORO, June 1 Kyodo

     A Japanese journalist who recently returned from fire-plagued
Mongolia has said fire fighters are still having a difficult time as
water is running out and high winds are spreading the blaze.
     Tadanori Matsuda, chief of the Sapporo-based Japan bureau of the
weekly Mongolian newspaper Mongol Times, said he witnessed the
massive fire that has raged through the forests, fields and mountains
of Mongolia for almost six weeks.
     Matsuda went to the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator in early May
and visited a mountain where the fire was burning.  About 10 nomads
working with shovels and tree limbs were trying to snuff out the fire.
     Matsuda said a total of 322 places have caught fire and as of
May 23, 29 grasslands and 84 mountains were still ablaze.
     Although firefighters had once put out the blaze, strong winds
have rekindled it, he said.
     The military has been called out around the capital to help
quell the inferno, but efforts to put out the blaze in rural areas
have not made progress, he said.
     In the eastern Mongolian frontier near the Chinese border in
Dornod Province, fire has rolled across 70 to 80% of the
area's grasslands, he said.
     Nomads and other people who live on the frontier lack
necessities for daily life, according to Matsuda.
     Matsuda is conducting a fund raising campaign for relief efforts
and is halfway to his goal of collecting 1.5 million yen from donors
in Japan.

S. Korea posts 1.44 bil. dlr trade deficit in May+

SEOUL, June 1 Kyodo

     South Korea posted an external trade deficit of 1.44 billion
U.S. dollars in May, bringing its cumulative trade deficit for the
first five months of the year to 7.46 billion dollars, the
International Trade and Industry Ministry said in a preliminary
report Saturday.
     Exports for the month under review increased 6.8% from a year
earlier to 11.37 billion dollars while imports advanced a larger 8.3%
to 12.8 billion dollars, the ministry said.
     The May figure came close to the government's revised trade
deficit projection for all of this year of 8 billion dollars.
     The South Korean government projected the 1996 trade deficit to
be 7 billion dollars at the beginning of the year but recently
revised it upward in the face of a rapid deterioration in the
nation's trade balance which started in April.

Japan promises to consult S. Korea over North issue+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told South Korean President Kim
Young Sam on Saturday that Tokyo will consult with Seoul before
making any decision on whether to provide additional food aid to
North Korea, Japanese officials said.
     Hashimoto made the remark in a telephone conversation in
connection with an expected call from the United Nations for the
international community to offer humanitarian aid to the North to
help alleviate the food shortage there, the officials said.
     Kim replied that he hopes Japan will talk with South Korea when
making a decision on the issue, they said.
     The two leaders also pledged to cooperate with one another in
co-hosting the 2002 World Cup soccer finals.
     As for proposed four-way peace talks on the Korean Peninsula,
Hashimoto said Japan hopes Pyongyang will agree to participate in the
talks soon.
     Kim and U.S. President Bill Clinton during their meeting in April
proposed that the Korean peace talks be held among North and South
Korea, China and the United States.

H.K. dailies rap high-ranking official's remarks on press+

HONG KONG, June 1 Kyodo

     Hong Kong newspapers Saturday criticized the top Chinese
official in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs for remarks he made
hinting at possible limitations on freedom of the press after the
British colony's reversion to China.
     Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
China's State Council, said in an interview with Cable News Network
(CNN) on Friday that no statements voicing support for ''two Chinas''
would be allowed after Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997.
     Lu told CNN that the news media in Hong Kong will have freedom
to criticize the Chinese government but that if it leads to movements
to overthrow the government, it would be a different matter.
     The Ming Pao Daily News in an editorial asked for explanation of
what he meant by the remarks, saying if he will not reveal his real
intention, it will create apprehension among Hong Kong citizens
toward the reversion.
     The Hong Kong Economic Journal expressed anger, sarcastically
saying the paper might be forced to carry only Xinhua News Agency's
reports that have criticized Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui.
     The Apple Daily carried a headline in Chinese that asked, ''Is
this what China means by freedom of the press?''
     Pro-Beijing papers such as the Wen Wei Po, however, only
reported Lu's remarks.
     Lu will start a weeklong official visit to Japan starting Sunday
to discuss with Japanese political and business leaders about Hong
Kong affairs.

500 Vietnamese apply to return home from Philippines+

PUERTO PRINCESA, Philippines, June 1 Kyodo

     More than 500 Vietnamese asylum seekers have applied for
voluntary repatriation and are expected to take Air Vietnam flights
to their homeland starting June 11, administrators of a refugee camp
southwest of Manila said Saturday.
     The group constitutes the biggest number of asylum seekers who
have volunteered for repatriation before the closure, at the end of
the month, of the Philippine First Asylum Camp some 570 kilometers
southwest of Manila, said Maj. Gen. Guillermo Ruiz, the camp
administrator.
     Ruiz said another flight is scheduled for June 15 and more are
expected in the weeks afterward to accommodate all those who have
volunteered to go back and whose return to Vietnam has been cleared
by the government there.
     The camp currently houses some 2,000 asylum seekers whose
applications for resettlement to third countries have been denied.
Earlier efforts to persuade them to go home have resulted only in
trickles of volunteers.
     Asked about the fate of those who refuse to go back or have not
been granted clearances, Ruiz said, ''It will be up to the church to
take care of them.''
     The Catholic Church has proposed a plan that includes the
gradual turnover of the camp to nongovernment organizations, the
legalization of the Vietnamese' interim stay, and assistance in
getting travel documents for remaining asylum seekers.
     The plan was drawn up following church criticism of the violent
dispersal of demonstrators who tried to prevent the forced
repatriation of 84 asylum seekers Feb. 14.
     Estimates of Vietnamese who would be unable to go home for
various reasons were unavailable, but Ruiz said the Catholic Church
has signaled its intention to take care of those people.
     Despite appeals from government officials and the church for the
asylum seekers to return voluntarily to Vietnam, few of the asylum
seekers have returned to Vietnam, officials said.
     In an earlier interview, camp leader Che Nhat Giao said many
Vietnamese families, especially those with children, have decided to
go home because of slim prospects for finding jobs in the Philippines
when the camp closes June 30.

21-member coalition government in India sworn in+

NEW DELHI, June 1 Kyodo

     A 21-member coalition government was sworn in Saturday following
the collapse of India's first Hindu nationalist government earlier
this week.
     While the Hindu nationalist government was formed May 16 in
accordance with the results of the recent general elections, it fell
May 28 following its failure to secure enough support to win a
parliamentary majority.
     The new five-party coalition government headed by H.D. Deve
Gowda was administered the oath of office by President Shankar Dayal
Sharma in a simple ceremony at the presidential palace.
     Apart from Prime Minister Gowda, 12 cabinet ministers and eight
ministers of state took oaths of office in the new coalition
government.
     Prominent among the cabinet ministers whose portfolios have yet
to be announced are P. Chidambaram, the popular commerce minister in
the previous congress and one of the architects of its economic
liberalization program, Inder Kumar Gujral, a former foreign
minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, a powerful regional leader and
champion of the lower castes and minorities, and Ram Vilas Paswan and
S.R. Bommai, heavyweights in the Janata Dal (People's Party).
     The five-party coalition government comprises the dominant
Janata Dal, the Samajwadi Party (Socialist Party), Telegu Desam,
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Tamil Maanila Congress.
     Aside from those groups, the coalition is supported by eight
other parties, including the left front comprised of four communist
parties, Madhya Pradesh Vikas Congress, Karnataka Congress, Asom
Gana Parishad and All India Indira Congress.
     Asom Gana Parishad, an important constituent of the coalition
government, is still unrepresented because the party has yet to
decide on participation in the new setup.  The Communist Party of
India is also expected to make a decision by Sunday on whether to
take part.
     Gowda, who is the second prime minister from southern India, has
seven ministers of cabinet rank from the three southern states of
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

Backers of 'comfort woman' to seek apology from premier+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Some 100 supporters of a South Korean woman, forced to provide
sex service for Japanese soldiers before and during World War II,
adopted Saturday a note of protest to be sent to Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto seeking a letter of apology.
     Hashimoto has decided to send letters of apology to the
so-called ''comfort women'' along with compensation payments from a
private fund, government sources said last month.
     The 74-year-old South Korean woman told the gathering that she
was abducted by Japanese Imperial Army at the age of 16 and sent to
brothels at the front line in such Chinese provinces as Hebei.
     She said the Japanese government should shoulder part of the
one-time payments to be given from the fund to surviving women in
South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan.
     The Asian Women's Fund was inaugurated at the government's
initiative last July as an event marking the 50th anniversary of the
end of the war.
     As the first batch of payments from the fund, its operators
plan to start making one-time payments of 3 million yen in July or
later to each of some 300 ''comfort women.''
     The government has maintained a policy that it will not extend
compensation from state coffers to former sex slaves despite a U.N.
report calling on it to compensate them and punish those responsible
for their recruitment.
     Historians estimate that 80,000 to 200,000 women, mostly from
the Korean Peninsula which was then under Japanese colonial rule,
were forced into sexual slavery in front-line brothels for the
Japanese Imperial Army.

Suu Kyi thanks Japan for pressuring junta+

YANGON, June 1 Kyodo

     Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi expressed
gratitude Saturday to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for
Japan's help in putting pressure on the ruling military junta to
release arrested members of her party.
     Suu Kyi said in an interview with Kyodo News that such pressure
helped to keep the junta from fully preventing a three-day convention
held by Myanmar's National League for Democracy (NLD) in Yangon from
Sunday to Tuesday.
     The junta arrested some 250 NLD members in an apprent bid to
prevent them from attending the meeting, the first large-scale
opposition meeting since Suu Kyi was released from six years of house
arrest last July.
     Soon after the junta's arrests, the Japanese and other
governments criticized the military regime, calling for the release
of those arrested.
     Of those detained, 111 have been released so far, according to
NLD sources.
     Suu Kyi also said Japanese pressure can help lead the junta to
release all the arrested people.
     She said the junta's reported action to have forced two of the
arrested members to sign a paper to leave the NLD is illegal and
should be nullified.
     The NLD won 392 seats of the 485 at stake in the May 27, 1990,
general election, but the junta ignored the results.

Brazil sports media blasts co-hosting of 2002 World Cup+

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, May 31 Kyodo

     The Brazilian sports media, which had largely anticipated that
Japan would be picked to host the 2002 World Cup finals, has heavily
criticized the decision by the world soccer governing body to jointly
award the competition to Japan and South Korea.
     Sports editors were unanimous in saying FIFA's decision will
bring on unforeseeable problems for the competition organizers and
has set a troublesome precedent.
     ''What will happen if three countries apply to host the 2006
cup?  If two countries have been selected now, why not three?'' said
Sergio Garcia, editor of the sports magazine Placar.
     Garcia said the co-hosting scheme is an indication that
Brazilian FIFA chief Joao Havelange's influence is waning.
     On the diplomatic front, Garcia speculated on whether the cup
will be officially dubbed the Japan-South Korea, South Korea-Japan or
even the Asia cup 2002.
     In a reported attempt to gain Havelange's support, South Korean
auto manufacturer Hyundai had inked a sponsorship contract with
Fluminense Football Club, of which Havelange is honorary president.
     Last month, however, Hyundai announced its decision not to renew
the contract, which expired Friday, one day before FIFA's official
meeting to choose the host country, and the move was seen to indicate
a successful bid by Japan for the cup.
     ''This decision will trigger unprecedented political problems
which will drag on through the coming months,'' Carlos Macedo, editor
of sports daily Jornal do Sports, told Kyodo News.
     The Jornal do Sports published Friday a full-page story
analyzing why Japan should definitely be appointed to host the cup.
     As with everything related to soccer, in the so-called ''Land of
Football'' the Brazilian media followed the battle of the Japan
versus South Korea hosting bid with great interest.
     Brazil is the only country to have won a World Cup four times
and ironically lost to Uruguay 2-1 in 1950, the only year the country
ever hosted the finals.

Japan, S. Korea back World Cup co-hosting+

ZURICH, Switzerland, June 1 Kyodo

     Japan and South Korea have unconditionally accepted FIFA's
decision to award the 2002 World Cup finals to the two nations amid
hopes that the tournament will break new ground in World Cup history,
Japanese soccer officials say.
     ''We believe a new age has arrived, one in which we will be able
to stage the World Cup finals with South Korea,'' said Shunichiro
Okano, vice president of the Football Association of Japan (JFA), on
the FIFA executive committee's vote Friday.
     JFA President Ken Naganuma said neither Japan nor South Korea
made any conditions when the 21-member FIFA committee took the
unprecedented move in an unanimous vote.
     FIFA's current rules forbid the World Cup from being staged in
more than one nation, apparently out of concern of having to face
momentous problems on how to divvy the matches, revenues and other
organizational work.
     Okano, speaking to reporters after the FIFA vote, said Japan
hopes to avoid a sharp cut in the number of Japanese venues for the
World Cup but conceded that any action will depend on a FIFA task
force report due by December.
     ''We will certainly state our position (to FIFA),'' Okano said.
     The 2002 World Cup finals will be contested by 32 nations, with
a total of 64 matches scheduled to be played throughout the
tournament.
     Okano also gave an outline of the events leading to Japan's
turnaround in its decision to change its all-or-nothing stance for
the bid.
     He said the Japanese delegation received on the eve of the FIFA
executive board meeting a letter from FIFA Secretary General Sepp
Blatter noting that South Korea had offered to consider joint hosting
if the move is endorsed by FIFA.
     Blatter asked what Japan's position would be.
     The Japanese delegation, joined by former Japanese Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, leader of a Japanese Diet lobbying group
for the World Cup, met for close to two and half hours and decided to
go along.
     The Japanese response was then put in writing and Okano was
dispatched to deliver the letter to the FIFA headquarters Friday
morning.
     ''I personally thought we could have won at the ballot.  But we
thought it would be bad policy to ignore (Blatter's) letter since we
didn't know how the FIFA executive board would react,'' Okano said of
Japan's reversal of its position.
     Saburo Kawabuchi, deputy chairman of the Japanese bid committee
and chairman of the Japanese professional soccer J.League, said he
would have liked to see FIFA award the 2002 World Cup finals to one
country alone.
     ''It would much easier to understand if there are only winners
and losers, as in the J.League.  But then, draw matches are allowed
in the advanced soccer countries, and we can't help that,'' he said.

Terasawa takes 2nd-round lead in Mitsubishi Denki Ladies+

KOBE, June 1 Kyodo

     Norimi Terasawa shot a 3-under-par 70 Saturday, equaling the
day's best score to take a three-stroke lead after the second round
of the 50 million yen Mitsubishi Denki Ladies tournament.
     Terasawa carded a lone bogey on the par-5 first hole before
rolling in four birdies for a two-day total 139 on the 6,263-yard,
par-73 course at Kitarokko Country Club in suburban Kobe.
     ''I think victory will come to me tomorrow if I play the same as
I have yesterday and today,'' Terasawa said.  ''A 2-under-par round
will be enough for me to win.''
     The 36-year-old veteran, who narrowly obtained this year's seed
by finishing in 50th place in last year's money rankings, has won two
Japan LPGA events but has been winless since capturing the 1991 Fuji
Sankei Ladies title.
     Cheng Mei-chi of Taiwan, who matched the second-round best with
her own 70, and Yuka Shiroto are tied in second place at 142.
     Mayumi Murai and Akiko Fukushima are another shot back.
     Overnight leader Wu Ming-yeh of Taiwan carded a 78 for a total
146, seven strokes off the pace.
     A field of 53 players survived the cut at 151 in the 54-hole
event.  The winner Sunday will take home 9 million yen.

Okano takes JCB Classic lead, but looking out for Ozaki+

SHIBATA, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     Unheralded Masayuki Okano heads into Sunday's final round at the
JCB Classic Sendai tournament with a one-stroke lead, but his hopes
for a first tour title are overshadowed by hard-charging Masahi
''Jumbo'' Ozaki.
     Okano, a 34-year-old pro in only his fifth year on the Japan PGA
tour, shot a 68 with five birdies and two bogeys Saturday for a
three-day total of 204 on the par-71 Omotezao Kokusai Golf Club
course in Miyagi Prefecture.
     ''I can't believe I will be part of the final group in the final
round.  I'm afraid my legs will be shaking tomorrow,'' said Okano,
whose official earnings totaled only 400,000 yen through last year.
     Ozaki, who has already won three tour events this year including
last week's Mitsubishi Galant in a playoff, and Hideyuki Sato each
shot a 67 to equal the day's best score and stand one shot behind
Okano.
     Defending champion and overnight leader Ryoken Kawagishi is two
strokes further back in fourth at 207, followed by Hidemichi Tanaka
and Nobuo Serizawa who share fifth place at 208.
     The winner will pocket 18 million yen Sunday in the 72-hole, 100
million yen tournament.

Japan's World Cup 'virtual stadium' left in the air+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Japanese bidders for the 2002 World Cup left the highly touted
''virtual stadium'' virtually up in the air Saturday, a day after
FIFA decided to split the World Cup finals between Japan and South
Korea.
     A senior official of the Japanese bid committee said the fate of
the proposed virtual stadium will hinge on the report from a newly
created FIFA working group in charge of looking into the implications
of the co-hosting decision.
     ''We won't know anything until we find out what the FIFA working
group is up to,'' said Morimasa Kondo, deputy director of the
Japanese 2002 World Cup bidding committee.
     Japan offered the so-called virtual stadium -- essentially a
huge screen to carry high-definition three-dimensional television
images of matches in other venues -- as a major feature of its bid
for the 2002 World Cup finals.
     Japanese bid committee officials argued that the virtual stadium
would enable more fee-paying fans to go out and watch World Cup
matches and promised to channel World Cup proceeds into a trust fund
for the benefit of international soccer.
     The co-hosting decision by FIFA's 21-member executive committee
Friday means Japan will get only a portion of the 64 matches
scheduled to be played during the tournament.
     Kondo said he has no idea how many Japanese cities will lose
their bids to become host venues because of the co-hosting decision.
     ''It is entirely a blank piece of paper,'' he said but noted
that Japanese World Cup organizers intend to utilize as many of the
bidding cities as possible.
     A total of 15 Japanese cities have offered to be venues for
World Cup matches, and 16 South Korean cities are also looking for a
piece of the World Cup action.

Japan, S. Korea to meet in World Cup final?

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     If Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and President Kim Young Sam
had their wish, Japan and South Korea would meet in the final of the
2002 soccer World Cup finals.
     Pipe dream?
     Not really, said Kim in a telephone chat with the Japanese prime
minister Saturday.
     ''The power of Japanese and Korean soccer has gone up
considerably and it is not impossible (for the two countries to meet
in the final),'' Kim was quoted as telling Hashimoto.
     Japanese officials said Kim placed the phone call to Hashimoto
Saturday afternoon, a day after FIFA awarded the 2002 World Cup
jointly to the two countries.
     After the two leaders pledged full cooperation from their
governments to make the unprecedented co-hosting a success, Hashimoto
raised the possibility for a World Cup final between the two
countries, Japanese officials said.
     ''If our teams can meet in the final, it would be nice,''
Hashimoto was quoted as telling Kim.
     Japan, which has never qualified for the World Cup finals, will
receive an automatic berth this time as a host.  South Korea has
qualified four times but has never gone beyond the first round.

Cuba loses to Mitsubishi in baseball friendly closer+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Mitsubishi Motor's Kawasaki baseball team upended Barcelona
Olympic champion Cuba 7-6 in the final game of the Baseball Week in
Japan series Saturday.
     The Cuban amateur squad finished the exhibition with five wins,
three losses and one tie in playing Japan's national team plus a host
of Japanese corporate and minor league pro ballclubs.
     Cuba rallied for three runs on RBI hits by Luis Ulacia and Migel
Caldes to knot the score 5-5 in the fifth, but reliever Omar Ajete
gave up a two-run homer in the bottom of the same inning.
     The Cubans scored another run in the sixth to make it 7-6 but
came up short of extra firepower in losing the game at Tokyo's Ota
stadium.
     Cuba and Japan will compete in the eight-nation Olympic
tournament in this summer's Atlanta Centennial Games.

Chung calls for new int'l club competition in Far East+

ZURICH, Switzerland, June 1 Kyodo

     South Korean soccer chief Chung Mong Joon on Saturday proposed a
new international soccer competition among the club champions of
China, Japan, North Korea and South Korea.
     Chung, also a vice president of the world soccer governing body
FIFA, said the proposed Far Eastern version of the European Champions
Cup will help boost the sport's popularity in the region.
     Chung also called for a resumption later this year of regular
international friendlies between Japan and South Korea, which have
been suspended since the last match took place in Nagasaki in July
1991.
     He unveiled an idea of such bilateral friendlies being held in
Seoul in October and in Japan in December this year.
     Chung's proposals came after the FIFA executive committee
decided to allow Japan and South Korea to co-host the 2002 World Cup
finals.

Osaka to bid for 1999 rhythmic gymnastics worlds+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Osaka will bid to host the 1999 rhythmic gymnastics world
championships, Japanese gymnastics officials said Saturday.
     The Japan Gymnastics Association decided on a domestic candidate
venue at an executive committee meeting held the same day.
     The site of the 1999 championships, which will also serve as the
qualifier for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, will be decided at the
general assembly of world gymnastics body FIG this July in Atlanta.
     Osaka, Japan's second largest city, has announced it will make a
bid to host the 2008 Olympics.

S. Korea to propose extension of no-visa visit to Japan+

SEOUL, June 1 Kyodo

     South Korea will propose to Japan that the two countries extend
the period of stay without visa in anticipation of travel growth
ahead of and during World Cup soccer competition in 2002, Yonhap News
Agency reported Saturday.
     Soccer's biggest event will be co-hosted by South Korea and
Japan, according to a decision made by the world soccer governing
body FIFA on Friday.
     The proposal calls for both countries to extend the period of
stay without visa to three months by 2002, the news agency said.
     Under the existing procedures, Japanese tourists are allowed to
stay in South Korea for a maximum of 15 days without visas.  But
South Korean tourists must obtain visas under Japan's present
immigration law unless they are on transit to a third country.  On
transit, they may stay in Japan up to three days.

News focus on problems of World-Cup co-hosting+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     By awarding the 2002 World Cup finals jointly to Japan and South
Korea, FIFA has stepped into unknown territory, raising more problems
than it has set out to resolve.
     FIFA chief Joao Havelange said FIFA will create a working group
to look into the matter and the following are some of the issues that
must be addressed in its report due back to FIFA by December.
     Logistics.
     Organizers in Japan and South Korea, two countries with
different communications and transport systems, immigration controls
and security apparatuses, must work things out to ensure the free
movement of millions of fans and to cope with an invasion of national
supporters for the 32 nations to contest the tournament.
     Take visa requirements, for instance.
     South Koreans coming to Japan must obtain a visa under Japan's
current immigration law unless they are on transit to a third
country.  For transit proposes, Korean visitors may stay in Japan for
up to three days.
     On the other hand, Japanese traveling to South Korea are exempt
from a visa if their stay in the country as a tourist is less than 15
days.
     World Cup operation.
     Operation of the World Cup tournament itself, some World Cup
experts say, is the easy part.
     One solution to co-hosting, these experts suggest, is to split
the World Cup down the middle, letting 16 nations compete in Japan
and the remaining 16 in South Korea.
     The idea does not sound totally absurd.
     Actually, only 16 nations had been allowed to compete the World
Cup finals until the tournament held in Argentina in 1978.
     Between the 1982 World Cup held in Spain and the last World Cup
held in the United States in 1994, there were 24 nations.
     And starting from the 1998 World Cup in France, the tournament
will feature 32 national teams.
     If the 2002 World Cup is split down the middle, the 16 teams can
be divided into four teams of round-robin play and the two top teams
in each group would advance to the final in each country.
     The South Korea champion would meet the Japan champion to decide
the final World Cup champion.
     This split-down-the-center formula would eliminate the necessity
for the national team supporters -- and their teams -- to crisscross
between the two countries during the tournament.
     One hiccup, of course, is whether Japan or South Korea will get
to be the defending World Cup champion in 2002, which will be decided
in the 1998 World Cup.
     Also, where will Brazil, the only four-time World Cup champion,
play?  Japan?  South Korea?
     The final.
     Under current FIFA rules, the World Cup final is decided by a
single match.
     There are already suggestions that FIFA should adopt the
two-match ''home-and-away'' formula used in Europe's UEFA Cup,
organizing the first leg of the two-match final, say, in Japan and
the second leg in South Korea.
     The home-and-away formula, proponents suggest, would
substantially boost revenues for the World Cup organizers not only
from entrance tickets but also from TV broadcasting rights.
     Opening ceremony.
     Diplomatic protocols could create a headache in organizing the
opening ceremony, which is traditionally attended by the host
nation's head of state.
     If South Korea gets the opening ceremony, will Emperor Akihito,
who serves as Japan's head of state, travel there and become the
first Japanese monarch to visit the former Japanese colony and risk a
backlash from the Koreans, many of whom still harbor bitter memories
of Japan's 35-year colonial rule?
     The list of issues does not end there.  Dividing sponsorship
money, TV broadcasting rights, fees and other sources of marketing
revenues will require leadership from FIFA.
     For their part, the political leaders in Japan and South Korea
vowed Saturday that they will cooperate for the success of the 2002
World Cup and turn the tournament into an ''example to the world.''

Winless Kyoto grabs draw in J.League Cup opener+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Kyoto Purple Sanga, following a record 15 consecutive losses in
the first half of J.League play, opened the J.League Cup with a 1-1
draw against Bellmare Hiratsuka on Saturday.
     Ruy Ramos, playing as a forward, injected dynamism into Kyoto's
attack in the first half and the strategy paid off with a 33rd minute
strike by new Brazilian midfielder Raudnei.
     Koji Seki, however, picked up a poor Kyoto clearance and scored
the equalizer in the 64th minute.
     ''The team has changed incredibly,'' said Ramos, a former Verdy
Kawasaki midfielder.  ''But change alone is not enough.  If there are
no results...'' He left the sentence unfinished.
     The two clubs will travel to Hiratsuka stadium Wednesday for
their second-leg match.  The side with more goals on aggregate will
earn three points.
     The 16 clubs are divided into two groups and will conduct seven
preliminary rounds on a home-and-away basis through Aug. 21.
     The top two sides in both groups will play in the Sept. 4
semifinals, followed by the final Sept. 25.
     Kashiwa outclassed host Urawa Red Diamonds 3-1 while Gamba Osaka
staged a 3-2 away win over reigning J.League champion Yokohama
Marinos.  Emperor's Cup holder Nagoya Grampus Eight salvaged a 1-1
draw against visiting Yokohama Flugels.
     Shimizu S-Pulse claimed a 1-0 victory over Kashima Antlers, as
did Sanfrecce Hiroshima over Jubilo Iwata, Avispa Fukuoka over JEF
United Ichihara, and Kawasaki over Cerezo Osaka.
     League play, which ended after the 15th round of matches May 18,
resumes Aug. 28.

Korean FIFA exec believes W-Cup co-host is trouble-free+

ZURICH, Switzerland, June 1 Kyodo

     South Korean soccer chief Chung Mong Joon, the reputed
mastermind behind FIFA's decision to split the 2002 World Cup finals
between Japan and South Korea, said Saturday the two countries should
be able to co-stage the tournament without much fuss.
     ''There is no major problem toward co-hosting.  (Even if there
is), it can be settled through sportsmanship,'' Chung said in an
interview with Kyodo News.
     Chung, who serves as one of the eight vice presidents in the
21-member FIFA executive committee, also said he believes that joint
hosting will help boost mutual understanding between Japanese and
South Koreans.
     Chung said he is sorry to see that the 2002 Cup was not awarded
to a single nation, but added, ''I believe joint hosting has merits
that you don't see in unilateral hosting.''
     ''Not only Korean-Japanese relations, I hope the 2002 World Cup,
the first in Asia, will turn into a festival to foster peace and
prosperity in Northeast Asia,'' he said.
     Chung said, however, he does not expect the World Cup alone will
do away with all historical animosities between the two countries.
     ''Sports alone cannot resolve all these problems.  Historical
fact is historical fact,'' he said.
     Chung said he believes South Koreans and Japanese should be able
to get to know more about each other through the 2002 World Cup and
open up a new page in bilateral ties in the 21st century.

Japan, Netherlands, Ukraine get v'ball Olympic berths+

OSAKA, June 1 Kyodo

     Japan, the Netherlands and Ukraine earned women's volleyball
berths in this summer's Atlanta Olympics on Saturday by securing the
top three spots in the final qualifying tournament.
     Japan overwhelmed Croatia 15-10, 15-4, 15-1, the Netherlands
beat Bulgaria 15-7, 15-9, 15-6 and Ukraine defeated Italy 15-8, 15-8,
15-6 in the eight-nation round robin at Osaka Municipal Central
Gymnasium.
     Japan, the Netherlands and Ukraine have identical 5-1 records.
     Croatia stands at 4-2 while Italy and Bulgaria are 2-4.
     Japanese women qualified for the Olympics for the ninth straight
times since volleyball became the Olympic event in 1964, winning the
gold medals in 1964 and 1976.
     ''By qualifying for the Olympics, we've moved one step toward
reaching my dream.  The next step is to get a medal in Atlanta,''
said ace spiker Tomoko Yoshihara.
     Romania downed Taiwan 16-17, 15-8, 15-9, 15-12 to pick up its
first victory in the tournament and Taiwan is winless.
     Japanese men, the Olympic gold medalists in 1972, failed to
qualify for the Atlanta Games.

Yomiuri rallies past Chunichi, drops Dragons from first+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Daisuke Motoki hit a bases-loaded triple with two out in the
eighth inning Saturday to spark the Yomiuri Giants to a 6-3 win at
the Tokyo Dome and drop the Chunichi Dragons from first place in the
Central League.
     With the Giants trailing 3-2 in the eighth, Motoki looped a
slider from reliever Sun Dong Yol over the head of rightfielder
Shigeki Oto, clearing the bases, and then came home on a single by
Kosuke Yoshihara.
     Sun from South Korea, 1-1, absorbed the loss for the Dragons,
which fell one game behind the victorious Hiroshima Carp, while Mario
Brito struck out the side in the Chunichi ninth for his sixth save.
     Chunichi roughed up Giants starter Balvino Galvez for three runs
on three hits in the first inning, but managed only one more hit the
remaining eight.
     At Chiba Marine Stadium, the Yakult Swallows eased past the
Hanshin Tigers 9-0 on a pair of two-run homers by Hensley Meulens and
Tom O'Malley and Tatsuki Yamamoto's four-hit pitching.
     In an afternoon contest, pinch hitter Itsuki Asai arched a solo
homer inside the leftfield foul pole in the top of the 10th inning to
lift the Carp over the host Yokohama BayStars 3-2.
     Asai's four-bagger saddled Yokohama starter Takashi Saito, 4-3,
with the loss despite a 12-strikeout performance while giving
Hiroshima sole possession of first place in league.
     In the Pacific League, Hiroshi Shibakusa, 4-1, scattered five
hits over eight innings, and the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters
downed the last place Daiei Hawks 5-1 at the Fukuoka Dome.
     The Kintetsu Buffaloes overcame five-run deficits twice to claim
an 12-9 victory over the homestanding Seibu Lions in a game  that
included 21 walks and two batters hit by pitches on both sides.
     Norihiro Nakamura wielded the big bat for the Buffaloes, going
4-for-5 with a walk and his 11th homer of the season.
     In Kobe, the Chiba Lotte Marines pounced on Orix starter Hiroshi
Kobayashi, 3-5, for seven hits and four runs early and held on for a
6-3 win over the BlueWave at Green Stadium Kobe.

 BRAZIL: RATES OF EXCHANGE AND RECOVERY

 Rudiger Dornbusch's claim that the Brazilian real is heavily overvalued has 
once again raised the question of whether Brazil and indeed the whole of the 
region is running a sustainable mix of economic policies. Dornbusch, a 
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claims that Brazil 
is in the same position Mexico was in 1994 and that the real is between 30% 
and 40% overvalued.

 We do not believe him, as we explain overleaf in our commentary on Brazil. 
We argue that unlike Mexico, the real's exchange rate against the dollar is 
not a proxy for an overvalued or undervalued exchange rate. 

 Brazil does much less trade (about 20% of its total) with the US than most 
Latin American countries. Mexico by contrast does more:  almost 70% of its 
trade is with the US. We argue that this difference means that whether 
Brazil's currency is overvalued should be assessed on a trade weighted 
basis.

 We would argue that Brazil's ability to maintain export growth suggests 
that its currency is not too overvalued. The Brazilian government's 
ruthlessness in slapping on tariffs when domestic industries are threatened 
makes it difficult to gauge whether the currency is overvalued, judging by 
whether imports are rising or falling. 

 What does seem clear to us is that Brazil is more likely to follow 
Argentina than Mexico in its method for adjusting domestic prices. Mexico 
devalued, and thus made domestic prices internationally competitive. 
Argentina is sticking to the more difficult, but probably ultimately more 
rewarding, policy of using a fixed exchange rate to force the domestic 
economy to become competitive. 

 Like Mexico, the result of this has been a painful recession, huge numbers 
of unemployed and more recently a pretty feeble economic recovery. The 
economic recovery, like Mexico's, is being led by investment and exports, 
rather than by growth in domestic spending.  

 Argentina's problem is its tax structure. This is tilted heavily towards 
consumption taxes which are not very productive in periods of recession. The 
government has to push on with its tax reform plans, and actually get some 
of them through congress if it is to avoid disaster. 

 What Argentina's policymakers are doing is using the recession to force 
domestic prices to adjust to international prices in real terms. Under the 
convertibility scheme goods and services in Argentina appeared to be 
expensive and imports started to flood the market. Although imports fell as 
Argentina's economy slowed down and then went into recession last year, 
exports actually continued to rise. Although Argentina's export performance 
is distorted by its heavy exports of wheat and other grains, it does seem 
that manufactured goods have managed to find export markets, particularly in 
Brazil. This suggest that the economy is adjusting successfully.

 Of course the same could be said of Mexico. If anything, its increase in 
manufactured exports has been more impressive: 30% last year and on top of 
that 25% this year. The problem though is that the performance of Mexican 
manufactures is distorted firstly by the effects of the maquiladoras, which 
are simply cheap labour operations, and secondly by the dominance of the US 
market in its foreign trade.

 This means that it is far from clear that the whole of the economy is 
benefitting from the devaluation. Even the government is now concerned by 
the fact that exports are so concentrated. It should be even more concerned 
by the sharp increase in luxury car imports which we report on in our 
analysis of Mexico. This suggests that the centrifugal forces in the economy 
are getting stronger.

 BRAZIL: REALISTIC FORECASTS: AS TRADE ACCOUNT TURNS AROUND

 Pedro Malan, the finance minister, gave a realistic assessment of where the 
Brazilian economy stood to two senate commissions, finance and tax, last 
month. He has downgraded the official forecast of growth for this year from 
5% to between 3% and 3.5%. He said that over the first two quarters of the 
year the economy had actually contracted, though there was now evidence that 
this recessionary phase had ended and the economy would grow strongly in the 
second half of the year. 

 The Instituto de Pesquisa y Economia Aplicada (Ipea), which is attached to 
the planning ministry, said the GDP growth rate for the 12 months to June 
1996 was 1.2%. It pointed out that this was an improvement on the minus 2.1% 
figure to the end of March.

 Other Ipea indicators are also beginning to flash green for growth. Its 
survey of industrial production found that there was a 3.9% increase in 
April compared to March. This franked the findings by the Federacao das 
Industrias de Sao Paulo (Fiesp) which reckoned that industrial output had 
surged by 4.7% between March and April. 

 Fiscal deficit. Malan was equally optimistic about the prospects for the 
fiscal deficit. He told the senate committees that the operating deficit 
would come down from 5% of GDP (last year) to 2.5% this year, and the 
nominal deficit would be about 5% of GDP, compared to 7.3% last year. He 
added that progress on the fiscal deficit depended on the government getting 
its constitutional reforms through congress. In particular, it wants to 
reform the social security system and the bureaucracy, the two main 
consumers of tax revenues.

 The treasury reckons that it ran a 671m reais surplus in May after 
collecting taxes worth 7bn reais. The surplus was largely because it did not 
have to make any extraordinary payments. The accumulated deficit for the 
first five months of the year is around 3.8bn reais, the treasury reckons. 

 The deficit is likely to increase sharply in June as the 13th month bonus 
falls due and 500m reais of holiday payments to bureaucrats fall due. 
Foreign debt payments are also likely to increase from May's 1.26bn reais.

 Trade. The really encouraging statistic comes from the trade account. 
According to Malan, export revenues are up by 10% in the first five months 
of the year (despite the collapse of coffee revenues), while the import bill 
is down by between 8% and 9%. Export revenues in May were US Dollars 4.5bn, 
and imports were worth about US Dollars 4.1bn. 

 The government is calculating on the trade account being more or less in 
balance by the end of the year. Some trade officials though believe this 
could be an underestimate and that the country is on course to  register its 
traditional trade surplus.

 The authorities are certainly doing their best to boost exports. On 19 
June, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced that the government was 
restoring an export credit scheme which had been suspended as part of its 
cost cutting programme. The Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ^mico now 
has US Dollars 1bn to finance particular categories of exports. It is 
offering credit at the rate of 5.5% over Libor for 15 months. 

 Antonio Kandir, the planning minister, said that rate was around a third of 
what the commercial banks were charging. The credit is aimed at 10 
industries: shoes, clothes, carparts, furniture, ceramics. whitegoods, 
electrical products, ironmongery, plastics and ornamental stone. 

 The credit is designed to help industries such as clothes and shoes which 
have been badly hit by the trade liberalisation policies while boosting the 
prospects of industries such as whitegoods and ceramics in which Brazil 
reckons it has a competitive advantage. The government is particularly keen 
on boosting ornamental stone exports: exports of marble and granite trebled 
last year to US Dollars 35m.

 Industrialists were pleased by the credit line. Luis Fernando Furlan, 
director of foreign trade at the Federacao das Industrias de Sao Paulo, 
reckoned that the effects of the credit line would be as beneficial to 
exports as a devaluation. 

 Besides putting the credit line in place, the government is also musing 
over creating an export credit guarantee agency, which would be capitalised 
largely with money from the private sector. This agency would try to compete 
with the Eximbanks, Cofaces and Hermeses of the developed world, which offer 
long term specialised finance to exporters. Brazilian industrialists reckon 
that this financing often offsets higher production costs in OECD countries 
and keeps exports from these countries competitive.

 Brazilian industrialists and trade officials moan that the system does not 
give exporters as much help: in fact they often face export taxes. Malan 
said that the government was trying to reform this, but its tax reform 
package was being stalled by congress. 

 Dagoberto Godoy, president of the Federacao das Industrias de Rio Grande do 
Sul, said that one possible answer would be to copy what Argentina had done: 
it had ended taxes on exports. 

 Current account. Malan's testimony to the senate committee was optimistic 
about the country's overall balance of payments. He reckoned that the 
country would run a current account deficit of around 2.5% of GDP, largely 
because of interest payments. He said the country should have little trouble 
financing this deficit because inflows of long term capital were so strong.

 In the first five months of the year longterm investments amounted to US 
Dollars 3.2bn, he said. The government was forecasting US Dollars 7bn by the 
end of the year. The country also had US Dollars 60bn in foreign exchange 
reserves at the end of May. 

 Dornbusch. The reserve figure and the strong inflows of foreign capital do 
not support Rudiger Dornbusch's claim that Brazil is about to face its own 
version of the 1994 Mexican devaluation crisis. Dornbusch claimed that the 
real is between 30% and 40% overvalued. He asserted that bringing the 
currency back towards its proper value would cause an economic dislocation 
on a par with what has happened in Mexico.

 We disagree with both Dornbusch's premise and his conclusion. To take the 
conclusion first. We believe that the quality of economic management in 
Brazil is far superior to that in Mexico. 

 There are two reasons for this. The first is that Brazil produces superior 
statistics and economic research: this breeds a lot more objective criticism 
of economic policy. 

 The second reason is related to this. The Brazilian government tends to be 
more responsive to alternative ideas and follows policies that are broadly 
related to what is happening in the Brazilian economy. Mexico is still far 
too interested in doing what pleases its international creditors. That 
attitude, above all else, was the reason for the Mexican crisis. Gimmicks 
such as Tesobonos which guaranteed investors against a devaluation boxed the 
Mexican government in and prevented it from devaluing until the economy was 
past the point of caring. 

 We do not accept Dornbusch's premise that the real is 40% overvalued. It 
may well be 10% to 20% overvalued against the dollar, but on a trade 
weighted basis the real is probably pretty fairly valued. The dollar is 
still cheap compared to DM and Yen.

 Unlike Mexico, Brazil's trade is not dominated by the US: almost 70% of 
Mexico's exports go to the US; only about 35% of Brazil's do. This means 
that a trade weighted measure of whether the real is overvalued is a more 
appropriate analytical tool, than a simple calculation against the dollar. 
(By analogy, the Swiss franc, French franc and DM all may be overvalued 
against the dollar but fairly valued against each other which is much more 
important from an economic point of view because so much of the three 
countries trade is with each other). 

 We would say that the Argentine peso is certainly at least as much 
overvalued against the dollar as the real. Yet the pattern of trade between 
Argentina and Brazil suggests to us that the two currencies are now pretty 
much fairly valued against each other.  The growth in Brazilian exports and 
drop in imports, plus the strength of direct investment in Brazil all 
suggests that the real is not massively overvalued. 

 Inflation: The government is forecasting an inflation rate of between 12% 
and 13% for the year. In the first five months of the year, inflation was 
5.1% according to the Fundacao Getulio Vargas and 14% for the 12 months to 
May. In May the rate of 1.55% was higher than the rate of devaluation 
against the dollar and the return on 30-day fixed deposits (1.5%). 

 Textiles: The government has imposed quotas on textiles from Panama, China 
and Taiwan (none of these countries yet belongs to the WTO) and is 
considering taking measures against four WTO members: Pakistan, South Korea, 
Hong Kong and Thailand. The authorities are under pressure from the textile 
industry to curb cheap imports. According to the textile industry, the 
number of companies has fallen from 832 in 1994 to 621 this year and that 
20,000 workers have lost their jobs because of unfair competition. 

 Unemployment: The Departamento Intersindical de Estudios Socioeconomicos 
calculates that unemployment is 15.9%. The government maintains that the 
official figure (which has risen from 5.7% to 6.4%) is more accurate. 

 The government admits that 2.1m jobs have been lost between 1988 and 1995. 
It blames the combination of the 1988 constitution, which guaranteed workers 
an annual bonus of a month's salary, maternity leave and lavish pensions, 
for pricing Brazilians out of jobs. It also says that the heavy investment 
in improved technology might have had something to do with the job losses. 

 Black economy: One in four workers in Rio de Janeiro makes a living from 
the black economy. That is 625,000 out of a total of 2.5m.

 MEXICO: GETTING BETTER: BUT STILL NOT OUT OF THE WOODS

 The gulf between what international investment bankers think is happening 
in Mexico and what Mexican businessmen know is happening seems to be getting 
even wider. On 22 June, Carlos Abascal, president of the Confederacion 
Patronal de la Republica Mexicana (Coparmex) urged his members not to panic. 
He said that while it was impossible to ignore reality and to believe that 
things were starting to improve, industrialists should not just give up and 
believe that things would never get better. 

 Abascal called upon the government to face reality and to stop pretending 
that everything was going swimmingly. He pointed out that the government 
could make a good case for itself, without saying that everything was rosy.

 Abascal is particularly concerned about the state of the banking system. He 
claimed that the government had so far done pretty well, pointing out that 
the rescue of the financial system had cost a mere 6.5% of GDP compared to 
the 30% of GDP Chile had to spend at the beginning of the 1980s when its 
financial system was wrecked by a devaluation following a period of peso 
overvaluation. 

 Coparmex, however, is not sure that the financial system has got over all 
its difficulties. Abascal said that the government needed to pay more 
attention to the banks' bad debt problems and come up with more schemes to 
convert debt into equity. He said that more help for the agricultural 
sector, which is also facing another year of drought, is urgently needed.

 Abascal also said that the government needed to introduce a more 
stimulatory fiscal policy (reduce taxes on new cars and corporate assets and 
rethink income taxes) and to ensure that the exchange rate remained 
competitive. 

 By contrast. The investment banks, on the other hand, can barely see 
further than the next mandate. Guy Erb, head of Goldman Sachs's Mexico 
office said that there was no sign that Mexico had saturated the 
international capital markets with its paper. John Donelly, head of Chase 
Manhattan's Mexico operations, said that the international markets were 
pleased by President Ernesto Zedillo's implementation of last year's 
economic plan. He said that the President had stuck to the letter of the 
plan. 

 Jaime Alatorre, from the Consejo Mexicano de Inversiones, claimed that 
foreign investors had poured US Dollars 1bn into the Mexican stockmarket 
this year. This was twice what they invested in the whole of 1995. Overall 
Mexico expects to attract financial investments (ie foreign investment in 
the Bolsa, GDR issues or debt issues on international markets) of US Dollars 
8bn this year. 

 Unemployment. To be fair there is some evidence that the economy has 
touched bottom. The most obvious indicator of this is the drop in 
unemployment. According to the official statistics agency, the Instituto 
Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica, the rate in May was 5.4%. 
This is a whole percentage point below the 6.4% recorded in January. This 
means that 2.67m Mexicans were officially unemployed in May.

 Inegi also reported that the percentage of workers either on strike or 
looking for a job has fallen from 10% in January to 8.8% in May. According 
to the agency 21% of Mexican workers still work less than 35 hours a week.

 Car sales. Another encouraging statistic is the pick up in car sales. In 
the first quarter domestic car sales were 24% higher than in the same period 
of 1995. Car imports increased by 65%. The most popular imports have been 
off-road vehicles (such as Explorer, Cherokee, Voyager and Land Rover) 
though imports of Mercedes Benzes and BMWs also increased sharply.   

 Even so, car sales still have some way to go to make up the ground they 
lost last year. The value of car sales dropped by 70% in 1995; volumes fell 
by 17% and sales of imports dropped by 65%. The industry, which supplies 18% 
of the country's manufacturing jobs, pulled through by increasing exports: 
these jumped by 28% in 1995.

 Exports are still strong. In the first quarter they increased by 39%. 
Overall production was 305,592 units.  

 Growth. The finance minister, Guillermo Ortiz, is still confident that the 
economy will grow by 3% this year. He said that his main concern now was 
ensuring that the growth rate remained at or above this level for the next 
few years.

 Even Ortiz is now conceding (what industrialists know) that the domestic 
market is still in difficulties. He said that domestic demand would grow by 
about 2% this year: a pretty feeble recovery after the 14% fall in 1995. 
Ortiz admitted that the recovery of the domestic economy was slower than had 
been expected because of the over-indebtedness of individuals and companies. 

 Inflation. The OECD's forecast for inflation in Mexico this year is 33%. 
This is well above the government's forecast of 21%. For 1997, the OECD is 
forecasting 17%. 

 In May, the CPI figure was 1.81%, well below the 2.8% recorded in April. 
The rate for the 12 months to June was 34%. The rate for the first five 
months of the year was 13.5%.

 What is slightly alarming about the inflation figure is the sharp rise in 
fruit and vegetable prices in May.

 Agriculture. The rise in food prices is partly due to the drought in the 
north of the country. This has hit the cattle industry particularly hard: 
Mexico's imports of meat increased by 94% in the first quarter of the year 
(admittedly to only US Dollars 11m) while its imports of milk almost 
quadrupled (to a more economically significant US Dollars 136m). 

 Already the number of cattle has fallen by a third to 9m as farmers cut 
their losses by slaughtering stock rather than buying expensive feed. 

 The government is also expecting to have to increase its imports of grains, 
especially maize. 

 OECD. Besides being more realistic about inflation than the government, the 
OECD is also pretty gloomy about growth prospects. It reckons that the 
economy will grow by at most 3% this year, but does not offer a figure for 
1997. The OECD highlights the fragility of the banking sector and the 
weakness of domestic demand: two of our themes over the past year. 

 More encouragingly, the OECD expects imports to pick up this year, but it 
does not expect more than a small current account deficit. The OECD expects 
this deficit to increase to 2% of GDP (US Dollars 6bn) in 1997.

 Trade account. The Secretaria de Hacienda reported that the country had 
record exports in May. It exported goods worth US Dollars 8.046bn and ran a 
trade surplus of US Dollars 532m.

 This brings the trade surplus for the first five months of the year to US 
Dollars 3.17bn. In 1995, the country ran a trade surplus of US Dollars 
7.35bn after running a deficit of US Dollars 18.5bn in 1994.

 What is encouraging is the increase in imports. These rose by 25% (year-on-
year) in May to US Dollars 7.5bn. This is sharply higher than the increase 
for the first five months as a whole which was only 8%. 

 Equally encouraging is the continuing growth in manufactured exports: these 
amounted to US Dollars 31bn for the first five months of the year (22% above 
the comparable figure for 1995). Oil revenues accounted for 12% of Mexico's 
total export revenues of US Dollars 37.7bn. This was 16% more than for the 
same period of 1995.

 MEXICO: THE REAL ECONOMY: STILL TILTED: TOWARDS EXPORTS

 The economic recovery is still heavily skewed. A study by the newspaper El 
Financiero, based on data from the finance ministry and the central bank for 
the first quarter, found that while exporting companies grew by 13.4% in 
real terms, domestic consumption grew by just 1.3%. and investment fell by 
4%.

 The investment figures are particularly disappointing. Another newspaper, 
Reforma, took a look at how companies had made out on the investments they 
promised to make in November 1995. The government had trumpeted the fact 
that the private sector would invest US Dollars 6bn in 1996.

 In fact, as Reforma found, very little of this investment has actually been 
made. Of the 28 companies quoted on the stockmarket which promised to invest 
US Dollars 4.4bn, 11 have invested nothing and have no plans to do so this 
year.

 Among these companies are ICA, a construction company, which promised to 
invest US Dollars 590m but has invested nothing; Bufete another construction 
company which promised US Dollars 255m but has invested nothing. Nine other 
companies have invested less than they promised (including Telmex, Iusacell 
and Alfa). 

 On the other hand three companies, Televisa, Gissa and Soriana have 
invested more than they promised and 14 have delivered on their promises. 

 EU: The European Union has formally given the go-ahead for the commission 
to start negotiations with Mexico about a free trade agreement. The 
agreement had been blocked by Britain as part of its non-cooperation policy 
with the EU in order to force concessions from its EU partners over the EU 
ban on exports of British beef and beef products.

 The EU and Mexico have agreed to set up a bilateral steering group which 
will decide on methods and a schedule for overcoming both the tariff and 
non-tariff barriers which block the way to freer trade. 

 Mexico believes that it should benefit from freer trade with the EU. In 
1995, it ran a deficit of US Dollars 3.35bn with the EU. 

 Steel production: Mexico's steel production in the first four months of the 
year was 11% higher this year (at 4.3m t) than in the same period of 1995, 
the Camara Nacional de Acero reported. The Camara says that if the industry 
keeps on at the current rate the country will produce 13m t of steel this 
year. This would represent a capacity utilisation rate of 92%. The biggest 
increase has been in laminated products where output has increased by 52% to 
1.6m t. 

 Teachers: A large number of the country's most important group of 
employees, the teachers, has rejected the government's offer of a 12% wage 
increase which was accepted by the official teachers union. The teachers 
launched a series of protests and demonstrations in the first half of June 
to back up their demands for a doubling of their wages. They currently 
receive US Dollars 226 a month.

 What unnerved the government was the strength of support for the claim. On 
five consecutive days over 20,000 people marched through the capital, 
demanding higher wages.

 The government felt that it had to respond, and officials from three 
ministries (interior, education and finance) met leaders of the dissident 
teachers. President Zedillo also asked the head of the capital's police 
force to resign after his heavy handed policing of the teachers' 
demonstrations left a dozen people injured.

 ARGENTINA: A BIT OF A JAGGED RECOVERY: QUESTIONS ABOUT FIRST QUARTER GROWTH

 The claims by the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, that the economy 
contracted by only 3.2% in the first quarter has been greeted with 
scepticism in Buenos Aires. Given that in the first quarter, agriculture 
probably declined by 5%, industry by 6% and construction by 17%, the rest of 
the economy (which accounts for the remaining 60% of output) must have done 
remarkably well.

 To be fair, the evidence is that oil and gas production, mining, power 
generation and other utilities had a good quarter. Equally, anecdotal 
evidence suggests that the tertiary sector of the economy had a poor 
quarter.

 More worrying is the most recent industrial trends survey from the 
Fundacion de Investigaciones Economicas Latinoamericanas which suggests that 
industrialists are revising downwards their expectations for business in the 
next six months.

 Just as alarming is the data for bankruptcies. Although the number of 
companies seeking reschedulings with their creditors fell by 10% between 
February and May 1996 (compared with the same period of 1995), the size of 
the debts involved increased by 13% in real terms. As for bankruptcies, the 
number of companies going bust increased by 74% although the amount of money 
involved increased by only 7%. 

 Lowest interest rates. Even the steady increase in bank deposits is not yet 
having a beneficial economic effect. Bank deposits topped US Dollars 50bn at 
the end of the May. This is a third more than in the same month of 1995 and 
11% up on 1994's figure.

 The government points out that this increase in liquidity has allowed 
interest rates to fall by two and a half percentage points: the prime rate 
is now 6.4%. These are the lowest rates since the convertibility plan 
started in 1991.  

 Bankers say that this abundance of liquidity has yet to tempt consumers to 
start borrowing again. They say that both companies and households are not 
yet confident enough about their economic prospects to gear up.  

 External sector. What seems clear  is that the external sector is still 
doing much better than the domestic part of the economy. Car exports to 
Brazil are still strong and agricultural exports have risen impressively. 
According to the Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos, agricultural 
and food exports, (excluding rice, sunflowers and soya oil, which are major 
revenue earners) were US Dollars 910m for the first two months of the year. 
This was 28% up on the comparable period of 1995. 

 Indec noted that meat, fish and fruit had been the biggest revenue earners 
but the biggest increases had come from sugar and alcoholic drinks. 

 The government is continuing to revise upwards its figure for agricultural 
exports. It now reckons that the country could export US Dollars 10bn worth 
of primary and processed foodstuffs. 

 Brazilian business. Exports are hugely dependent on what happens in its 
larger neighbour. The Argentine ambassador to Brazil, Alieto Guadagni, said 
that Argentina's exports to its neighbour should be worth US Dollars 7bn 
this year. Last year Argentina shipped US Dollars 5.6bn worth of goods to 
Brazil.

 Cavallo himself underlined how important a flourishing Brazil now is to 
Argentina's economic recovery. He paid a quick visit to Brasilia to meet the 
whole of the Brazilian economic team to check that they would not change the 
economic policy in early June. During a series of meetings with everyone 
from President Cardoso down, Cavallo said that it was clear that Brazil 
would not change its exchange rate nor its economic policy. 

 Cavallo claims that the two economies were now in some sort of economic 
sync: both would grow this year and register low inflation. Low inflation is 
likely. A more open question is whether Argentina will hit Cavallo's target 
of 5% growth this year: the consensus in Argentina is that the economy will 
do well to grow by 3%.  

 Deficit. The government's fiscal position is still under pressure. The 
fiscal deficit may not just be a temporary problem caused by the 
sluggishness of the economy which has hit revenues. The creation of private 
pension funds has deprived the government of an important source of cash. It 
can also be argued that the decision to lower employers' compulsory 
inflation adjust for pensions (a liability which has been switched to the 
government) will also put pressure on government finances, even when the 
economy recovers. 

 The government has already consulted the IMF about getting some leeway for 
this year's fiscal targets. In the first four months of the year it had 
already run up a deficit equivalent to 70% of the US Dollars 2.5bn that was 
envisaged for the year as a whole. 

 The government is likely to be able to muddle through this year, but next 
year the problems will be even worse. Firstly its debt service payments will 
rise, as principal payments started on Bocones and the costs of the huge 
amount of borrowing in the past year or so start to have an effect. The 
other problem will be the consolidation of the (bust) provincial pension 
funds into the national state fund. 

 The government is still shirking structural reform measures: its only 
response to the growing problem has been to borrow more to shore up this 
year's accounts. In 1995 the country increased its net debt by US Dollars 
5.8bn and this year it has borrowed between US Dollars 4bn and US Dollars 
6bn.

 This is a dangerous policy. If US interest rates start to rise in the 
autumn, as the US credit markets expect, Argentina could find the door to 
the international credit markets slammed shut in its face. The crunch could 
come at the beginning of 1997.

 VENEZUELA: INFLATION KEY: AND CUTTING THE BUREAUCRACY

 The planning minister, Teodoro Petkoff, is clear about the economic 
variable which will determine the success or failure of the current economic 
plan: inflation. He recently told an audience of New York bankers and 
businessmen that nothing was more important for the poor and lower middle 
class than a lower inflation rate.

 Petkoff is still confident that the inflation rate will start to ebb this 
month: he is still aiming for a 2% monthly rate by December. 

 Petkoff was more guarded about the government's spending plans: he said 
that the government could not slash the social payments, but would take 
action to reorientate them. This is a reference to the increased social 
security payments the government announced along with its adjustment package 
in April.

 The government doubled the value of the payments it makes under its food 
stamps programme: this enables the poor to buy staples such as milk, eggs 
and rice. The government also doubled pensions and announced youth job 
creation schemes and an increase in the subsidised medicine programme. The 
IMF has put pressure on the government to reduce these payments. 

 Bureaucracy. The government is unwilling to cut these payments by as much 
as the IMF wants. Petkoff has made it clear that he would prefer to cut 
government spending by slimming down the civil service. He notes that 
Venezuela has 800,000 civil servants: that is 300,000 more than Brazil, he 
claimed. 

 Petkoff said that he did not expect to push through a six month programme 
to slash civil service numbers, as this would produce chaos and unrest. The 
first government move, he said, would be the imposition of a hiring freeze.

 Managing this process, Petkoff reckons, will be far from easy. But he said 
that the bureaucracy had to be cut back if the fiscal deficit was to be 
brought under control. 

 The banking system. There are signs that the banking system is on the mend: 
Jose Maria Nogueroles, president of Banco Provincial, the country's solidest 
bank, said that the bank's capital position was 13% stronger in real terms 
in March 1996 than in March 1995.

 The government is hoping to take advantage of this favourable wind to sell 
two of the banks it rescued in 1994. The big sale will be Banco de 
Venezuela, the country's second biggest bank but the government is also 
trying to sell the smaller Banco Tequendama.

 Banco de Venezuela now has assets of US Dollars 812m and according to a 
private consultancy, Softline, deposits of US Dollars 700m. Salomon Brothers 
is advising the government on the sale. Prequalification for potential 
bidders closed on 7 June. 

 The government has also pencilled in November as the date for the sale of 
Banco Consolidado, the country's fourth biggest bank. 

 Petkoff said the country hoped to get a loan of US Dollars 1bn from the 
multilaterals to help pay for the restructuring of the banking system. He 
reckoned this would be about half the total cost of sorting out the system.

 IMF. Petkoff has refused to give details on exactly how much the country is 
hoping to get from the multilaterals. The IMF has agreed to lend the country 
US Dollars 1.4bn over 12 months, and the deal is scheduled to be signed this 
month. 

 According to Petkoff, the loan can be converted into a structural 
adjustment facility at the end of the year if the government and the IMF 
agree. 

 Petkoff is also negotiating loans from the World Bank and the IDB. The 
country is expecting to get US Dollars 900m from the World Bank and US 
Dollars 1bn from the IDB. These loans will be designed to help pay for the 
restructuring of the financial sector and to ease the adjustment burden. It 
is likely that these loans, especially the money from the World Bank, will 
be tied to the privatisation programme. 

 Airlines: Other airlines are joining American Airlines in demanding 
compensation from the government for the losses caused by the government's 
exchange rate policies. American Airlines has asked for US Dollars 8m. 
Another 10 airlines say that the changes in the exchange rate have cost them 
US Dollars 21m. The airlines say that the losses were caused by the 
government's policy of exchange controls which tried to hold the bolivar at 
170 (and then 290) to the dollar. 

 American and the other airlines claim that their applications to exchange 
bolivars for dollars were blocked from July to September 1995 (when the rate 
was 170) and that they were only paid when the bolivar had dropped to 290 to 
the dollar. Under international agreements with the airlines, countries 
undertake to recompense airlines for losses caused by exchange rate 
variations. 

 Although the government is fighting the case in the courts, the finance 
minister, Luis Matos Azocar, is making conciliatory noises and says that an 
out-of-court settlement should be reached. He also pointed out, however, 
that the exchange control regime did not guarantee that companies would be 
able to get all the dollars they had asked for. 

 Reformulated petrol: The government is pleased by the WTO's decision in its 
favour. The WTO has ruled that the US was acting in a protectionist way by 
allowing US refineries more time to meet clean air standards. Imported 
reformulated petrol had to meet the new standards immediately. Venezuela, 
which was exporting between 55,000 and 60,000bpd of reformulated petrol, 
argued that the measure discriminated against its exports because US 
produced products did not have to meet the same standards. The state oil 
company PDVSA said that the unfair trade practice cost it about US Dollars 
50m because it had to ship the product to less profitable markets.

 CHILE: BANK LAW READY FOR APPROVAL: FROM IMPORTER TO EXPORTER

 Congress is on the point of passing a new banking law. This would both free 
the banks to do more internationally and domestically, define bank secrecy 
and force banks to meet the so called Basle committee's minimum, risk-
weighted capital adequacy standards.

 The law was designed by the previous government and included provisions to 
sort out the subordinated debt question. The state still holds a lot of 
subordinated debt issued by Chilean banks to stave off their collapse at the 
beginning of the 1980s. This issue has now been separated from the other 
issues which will modify the Ley General de Bancos. 

 Chile has 34 banks, of which 19 are foreign owned, three are sociedades 
financieras and one is state owned, Banco del Estado. Standard & Poor's, one 
of the world's most important credit rating agencies, recently issued a 
report which claimed that Chile had the solidest banking system in the 
region. Indeed the banks' non-performing loans have fallen from 2.1% of 
total assets in 1990 to about 1%. 

 The new businesses that banks will be able to get into are insurance (but 
not life assurance) stockbroking, factoring, running mutual funds and funds 
for investment overseas, custody of securities and financial advice.

 Subordinated debt. The banks have until 23 July to do a deal with the 
central bank to sort out the subordinated debt issue. The central bank now 
holds US Dollars 4.58bn worth of subordinated debt. The banks with the 
biggest amounts still outstanding at the end of March 1996 were Banco de 
Santiago (US Dollars 1.7bn);  Banco de Chile (US Dollars 1.7bn); Banco de 
Concepcion (US Dollars 654m); BHIF (US Dollars 380m) and Banco Internacional 
(US Dollars 127m). Under the terms of the deal to rescue banks in 1982 the 
central bank bought the bank's non-performing loans from them with 
subordinated debt: the banks undertook to buy the debt back over time, but 
no deadline was set. 

 The economy: The government is still concerned about inflation. It wants to 
hit its target of 6.5% for the year and is prepared to keep the currency 
overvalued (at least against the dollar) until the 12 month lagging rate 
comes closer to that target. The 12 month lagging rate stood at 8.6% at the 
end of May. The government has also indicated that it will not hesitate to 
increase interest rates (as it did in March) if it believes that the economy 
is growing too fast. In the first quarter the rate of growth was verging on 
9%. Growth last year was 8.25%, the highest in Latin America. 

 Investment: The finance minister said that the public sector would spend US 
Dollars 7.89bn between 1996 and the end of the millennium on infrastructure 
projects. He hoped that the private sector would invest a similar amount. 

 The president of the Camara Chilena de Construccion, Eugenio Velasco, 
reckoned that the country needs US Dollars 14.2bn worth of infrastructure 
over the next five years: he said that bottlenecks at ports and poor roads 
cost the country US Dollars 1.65bn in lost exports and repairs every year. 

 This year private sector investment in infrastructure is likely to 
increase. In 1995 it jumped to US Dollars 509m from US Dollars 31m in 1994. 
The government's target for 1996 is US Dollars 2.5bn. Most private sector 
construction projects are financed by bank loans. 

 Pension funds: The pension funds are finding the going tough. In the year 
to May they have returned only 1.2%., well below the average annual return 
of 12.6% since 1981.  The fund administrators point out that the worst may 
now be over: the funds rose by 1.7% in May. The best performers were 
Habitat, Aporta and Valora, which rose by 9%. The funds have assets of US 
Dollars 26.8bn, 40% of which is in Chilean government debt, a third in 
shares and 24% in private sector debt. Less than 0.2% of the funds' assets 
are invested internationally.

 COLOMBIA: SAMPER CLEARED: BUT QUESTIONS REMAIN

 President Ernesto Samper was cleared of knowing that his successful 
election campaign was financed by the drug cartels. He was cleared after an 
investigation by the Camara de Representantes. The US attitude to Colombia 
is still unclear though the omens are not good.

 Although the US ambassador to Colombia, Myles Frechette, said that the US 
wants to boost trade between the two countries, the Colombians are fretting 
about sanctions that may be taken because of a dispute involving American 
Airlines. Until 1993 American flew from new York to Bogota; but it then 
suspended the service, saying it was not making money. The Colombian 
authorities awarded the route to Continental Airlines earlier this year, 
producing squawks of outrage from American. The US government has taken up 
American's complaint and threatened Avianca's daily flight from Bogota to 
New York. The Colombians have rejected the suggested compromise from the US 
that two airlines from each country should fly the route: the Colombians say 
that this would produce too much capacity. 

 Car sales: Sales of imported cars fell by 23% in the first four months of 
the year. Sales of domestically assembled cars dropped 13%. 

 Investment: Foreign investment in Colombia increased by 19% in the first 
two months of the year to US Dollars 160m, according to the Corporacion 
Invertir en Colombia. The financial sector was the most popular, accounting 
for US Dollars 75m of new investment.

 Ganadero: A Spanish bank, BBV, bought 40% of Banco Ganadero for US Dollars 
300m. Ganadero has assets of US Dollars 3bn and made US Dollars 14m in the 
first quarter of this year.

 ECUADOR: BUCARAM AHEAD: BUSINESS ALARMED

 Businessmen are alarmed at the strong support for the Guayaquil populist 
Abdala Bucaram. He did much better in the first round than the opinion polls 
had suggested and looks more confident going into the run-off with Jaime 
Nebot on 7 July. Nebot is the candidate of the firmly middle class Partido 
Social Cristiano and if he should lose there is likely to be a bout of sucre 
weakness. The new government does not take office until August. 

 Bucaram's economic policies are not particularly clear. He has refused to 
debate with other candidates, preferring to issue pamphlets saying that he 
will not follow the current economic policies which he says pander to the 20 
national monopolies. Exactly who he will use to advise him on how to run the 
economy is unclear: all Bucaram will say is that he is a friend of Roberto 
Isaias, the owner of Filanbanco, one of the country's biggest banks, and 
interests in sugar and the media. Bucaram made his career as a populist 
mayor of Guayaquil where he developed a taste (reputation) for wild 
rhetoric. He was not generally considered to be a likely winner of the 
election. 

 Nebot, by contrast, was the longtime favourite. He is known to support more 
liberalisation and privatisation. 

 The country's electoral law bars opinion polls from being published in the 
run up to the election. One of the last, published on 2 June, after the 
first round results, gave Bucaram 44% of the votes against 31% to Nebot and 
24% undecided. The problem for Nebot is that the supporters of the third and 
fourth candidates in the first round, Freddy Ehlers and Rodrigo Paz, are 
unlikely to support his economic policies which form a key part of his 
platform: Ehlers was against opening up the economy and Paz and his party 
have opposed economic reform. 

 Although the second round will determine who becomes President, the first 
round has elected the members of congress. Here Nebot seems to have fallen 
short of the 30 seat target he set himself.

 PERU: MORE BUREAUCRATS TO BE SACKED: TO BOOST CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

 The government wants to cut the number of bureaucrats. This was one of its 
main promises to the IMF in its recent letter of intent. Over the past five 
years the government has already trimmed its workforce by 1m. Nevertheless, 
900,000 people still work for the government. 

 Despite these cuts, paying for the bureaucracy still swallows 65% of the 
country's tax revenues. The country collects US Dollars 242m a month in tax 
and customs duties. 

 This heavy bureaucratic expense means, the government says, that its 
spending on capital projects and debt payments is reduced. 

 In parallel with its plans to reduce the bureaucracy, the government is 
also trying to create 130,000 jobs a year as part of its anti-poverty 
programme. 

 The government wants to streamline both the central government and regional 
government. It says that there are still too many rules and regulations 
covering budgeting, accounting, cash management and procurement. 

 The government now wants to get each part of the administration to set its 
own systems, which it hopes will be more practical than a generalised system 
to cover every bureaucratic eventuality. The government also says that it 
will try to make individuals in the bureaucracy responsible for their 
actions.

 Tax overhaul. The government points out that the IMF has already welcomed 
some of its bureaucratic reforms, in particular its achievement in 
increasing the tax take from 5% of GDP to 14% in only four years. 

 The government also says that the IMF has said its privatisation and anti-
poverty programmes are models for other countries to follow. 

 The IMF has agreed to lend Peru US Dollars 150m to finance its Brady plan. 
This involves buying back debt and US Treasury bonds to back new bond 
issues. The government expects to sign its Brady deal in October. 

 Pension problems: The country's private pension system has lost US Dollars 
3m so far this year. Of the six Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones, only 
two, Horizonte and Integra, made profits. Both figures were marginal. 

 The companies say they are losing money because their marketing and 
operating costs are higher than their income. The main reason for this is 
that Peruvian companies are well behind on their payments to the AFPs. The 
official figure is that they are 50% in arrears. The AFP superintendency is 
mulling over the idea of offering companies easy terms to bring themselves 
back up to date. 

 So far the pension funds have signed up 1m people and built up funds of US 
Dollars 1bn. 

 Chilean investment: The Camara de Comercio de Santiago expects Chilean 
investment in Peru to hit US Dollars 3bn this year. This will be 30% more 
than the US Dollars 2.7bn registered at the end of 1995.

 The surge of Chilean investment has increased trade between the two 
countries, and led to a hefty Chilean trade surplus. Of the US Dollars 586m 
in total trade between the two countries, Chilean exports amounted to US 
Dollars 438m.  

 Tariffs: The government says that it will only move its tariff system to 
harmonise with the Andean Group's when that group lowers its tariffs to 
Peruvian rates. Peru still does not seem inclined to adopt the Andean 
Group's four rates for external tariffs (20%, 15% 10% and 5%). Peru's 
external tariff rates are 5%, 10% and 15%. 

 Currently Peru has partial free trade agreements with Colombia, Ecuador and 
Venezuela but does not apply the Andean groups external tariff system.

 BOLIVIA: DEBT NOT A PROBLEM: SAYS CAMDESSUS

 Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, said that the country's 
foreign debt with the multilaterals should not impede its growth and 
economic development. Camdessus, who stopped in Bolivia during his tour of 
South America, said he was not coming to La Paz as some sort of 
international monetary policeman. He also said that it would be wrong to 
muddle up Bolivia's efforts to reduce its foreign debts with its fight 
against poverty. 

 Exports: The government is hoping that it can increase its soya exports 
once it is linked to the transport systems of the Mercosur.

 Banking system: Two thirds of the country's US Dollars 2.2bn in bank 
deposits are fixed term. A further 20% are held in current accounts, the 
Superintendencia de Bancos y Entidades Financieras reported in its 1995 
annual report.

 COSTA RICA: MISSING THE IMF TARGET: AS FIGUERES SNUBBED

 T
he government has admitted that it will miss the fiscal deficit target it 
agreed with the IMF this year. The target is 0.5% of GDP, but Fernando 
Herrero, who resigned as finance minister in June said that the likely 
outcome for this year would be a deficit of 2%. 

 Herrero said the government had been undone by two things: higher interest 
expenses (the government has run up domestic debts of US Dollars 2.9bn) and 
lower than expected tax revenues. The latter he said was due to the poor 
growth of the economy. 

 Herrero, who is handing over to Francisco de Paula Gutierrez, said the IMF 
may well take a lenient view of the missed targets, especially if it thought 
that other parts of the structural reform programme were going well. He did 
add, however, in his resignation report on the economy, that the government 
would need to raise new taxes to pay for its education, infrastructure and 
health programmes.

 De Paula Gutierrez. Herrero said he had resigned for personal reasons. He 
was married to another former member of the cabinet, Florisabel Rodriguez. 

 Herrero had presided over a fierce adjustment package to undo economic 
damage done in the first two years of President Jose Maria Figueres' 
administration. The worry is that political pressures will mean that the 
government will try to engineer a boom in the run-up to the elections in 
1997. The President has promised not to go for growth, but with over 50% of 
Costa Ricans reckoning that he has been a lousy President, this might 
change. 

 De Paula Gutierrez is a professional economist and has said the 
government's economic policy should not change. Before joining the 
government he was head of the Instituto Centroamericano de Administracion de 
Empresas. He is considered to be more of a free-marketeer than Herrero.  

 Contralor general: The government was forced to drop its contralor because 
of his closeness to the President. This made it doubtful that he could take 
an objective view of government spending. The new contralor, selected after 
three months of political bickering, is Luis Fernando Vargas, a member of 
the ruling PLN and a deputy labour minister in the Oscar Arias 
administration. Vargas's election is another snub to the President who 
supported another candidate. The (PLN) president of the legislative 
assembly, Walter Coto, led the rebellion by three PLN members.

 CUBA: LAGE FORECASTS 5%: GROWTH THIS YEAR

 The country's Vice President Carlos Lage reckons that the economy will 
slowdown after registering a 7% growth rate in the first quarter. He is 
sticking to a forecast of 5% growth for the whole year. 

 Lage said that the economy was boosted in the first half of the year by the 
increase in sugar production. The country just scraped through to  the 4.5m 
tonne target set by the government. In mid-June, with two or three sugar 
mills still grinding, the country had produced 4.45m t of sugar. This year's 
crop though was a big improvement on 1994/95's 3.3m t.

 Lage claimed that the economy grew by 2.5% last year, but the government's 
statistical information is still rudimentary and there are few ways of 
verifying statements made by leading politicians. 

 One of the fastest growing sectors of the economy appears to be the nickel 
industry. The government says that the country will produce a record 50,000t 
of nickel this year. This is a 40% increase on the 1995 figure. The problem 
is that nickel mining does not have much effect on the rest of the economy. 
At most  2,000 people benefit directly from the increase in production. 

 More important is the increase in tourism. Last year 730,000 people visited 
the island (20% more than in 1994) and the government is hoping for 1m 
visitors this year. Also important is the 25% increase in tobacco production 
and the 22% increase in agricultural output.

 The only downbeat part of Lage's report on the state of the economy 
concerned foreign investment. He noted that this had stalled, following the 
decision by the US Congress and then the administration to turn the Helms-
Burton bill into law. This allows the US to take punitive action against 
companies and individuals who have bought assets in Cuba claimed by US 
companies or individuals. Lage said that although new investment had not 
been forthcoming, no companies had yet said they would pull out of Cuba 
because of the law.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: ELECTIONS AND FRAUDS: FROM IMPORTER TO EXPORTER

 The country faces a second round of the presidential elections on 30 June. 
The issue is whether the frontrunner in the first round, Jose Francisco Pena 
Gomez, can hang on and win. Ranged against him is not only the runner-up in 
the first round, Leonel Fernandez, but also the ruling party and the current 
President Joaquin Balaguer whose candidate, Jacinto Peynado, came a poor 
third.

 Balaguer is, apparently, very much against Pena Gomez, largely because Pena 
Gomez is black. Pena Gomez from the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano won 
46% of the votes in the first round, well ahead of the 395 won by Fernandez 
from the Partido de la Liberacion Dominicana. Peynado, from the Partido 
Reformista Social Cristiano, won 16%. 

 Corruption. The Contraloria de la Republica Dominicana revealed that 
800,000 state cheques had been forged, costing the government US Dollars 
47m. The contralor, Victor Grimaldi, pointed out that no official had yet 
been charged or convicted of any crime. The cheques seem to have been issued 
by the Tesoreria Nacional.

 EL SALVADOR: MAKING A GESTURE: BOOSTING PUBLIC WORKS

 The government is still under pressure from industry to take the brakes off 
the economy. The government was obliged to tighten monetary policy last year 
in order to stop credit growing at a destabilising rate and inflation 
getting out of hand. The private sector still reckons that policy is too 
tight. It wants the economy to be growing by at least 6% a year.

 The Camara de Comercio e Industria de El Salvador said that achieving 
stability was not enough: the economy had to also recover its dynamism. In 
1992 and 1993 the economy grew by over 7% a year in real terms. This rate 
dropped to 6% in 1994 and 1995. 

 The government of President Armando Calderon Sol clearly felt that it had 
to at least make a gesture. So at the beginning of June, on its second 
anniversary of accession to office, it announced a US Dollars 114m public 
works programme. 

 Besides this, the President also announced that the tariff reform programme 
would be slowed down: in particular the government says that it will give 
local industry more time before tariffs on consumer goods are lowered.

 The government is still planning to lower tariffs on capital goods to zero 
by the end of the year. Exports are also eligible for a 6% tax refund. 

 Crime. The opposition is linking the problems in the economy with the huge 
increase in crime. Marta Valladares, a leader of the former guerrilla group, 
the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional, claims that there 
were 8,000 murders in the country last year. This was more than the annual 
casualties in most years of the civil war she said. Even some members of the 
ruling Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (ARENA party) concede that more 
needs to be done to build up civil society and reduce poverty.

 GUATEMALA: THE RIGHT SURFACES: AS GUERRILLAS DROP TAX

 The hardliners opposed to any peace deal with the guerrilla Unidad 
Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca have broken cover. A group of 
landowners, the Coordinadora Nacional Agropecuaria has criticised the 
government for not using the army to break up meetings called by the URNG or 
using soldiers to evict peasants from land they are squatting on.

 Conagro tried to derail the peace agreement last year by protesting against 
concessions offered by the government. Conagro claimed that they were 
unconstitutional but the constitutional court overruled this. 

 The government is pressing on with its programme to get a peace deal in 
place. Officials say that the URNG's commitment not to charge business the 
so-called 'war tax' seems to be holding. Gustavo Porras, president of the 
Comision de Paz, says that the people who seem to be levying the tax appear 
not to be guerrillas, but just common criminals. 

 Army: President Alvaro Arzu said that peace and a smaller army would not 
necessarily mean that the government could cut the military budget and spend 
the money on something else. He said that more mobile armed forces, needed 
to combat drug traffickers and protect forests, were more expensive. He 
noted that although Guatemala's armed forces had fallen from 47,000 to 
32,000, little money had been saved. 

 Strikes: The government is pushing on with its plans to reform the labour 
code which will end the right to strike for people employed in  essential 
public services. 

 Tax: The government reckons that the Impuesto de Solidaridad Extraordinario 
y Temporal should raise US Dollars 21.6m. This is a sort of supertax on 
companies and individuals with earnings of more than US Dollars 8,000 in 
1994/95. The tax is set at 1% for this year and will rise to 1.5% in 1997. 
People who make six monthly payments will get a 10% discount.

 CHILE: CODELCO AND THE COPPER MARKET: LINKS BETWEEN DAVILA AND HAMANAKA

 The Corporacion del Cobre, Chile's state-owned copper mining company, is 
likely to be badly affected by the fall in copper prices following the 
discovery that Yasuo Hamanaka had run up US Dollars 1.8bn in loss-making, 
unauthorised trades over the past 10 years. Codelco  traded heavily with 
Sumitomo, which was one of the few Japanese trading houses not to develop 
mines of its own. Instead it relied on the London Metal Exchange to buy 
stocks of copper to meet its clients needs. Japan, despite being a 
negligible copper producer, has the world's second biggest copper smelting 
industry. Codelco is the world's biggest copper producer. 

 Codelco had reckoned that the copper price would average between US Dollars 
1.15 and US Dollars 1.16 a pound this year. In the week of 24 June the 
copper price slid to just 81 cents a pound before recovering slightly. The 
fear in the copper market is that Sumitomo, which had built up huge stocks 
of copper which it used to try and squeeze the market, will now have be a 
forced seller as its management tries to adjust its position. 

 The fall in copper prices has been dramatic. Last year the price averaged 
US Dollars 1.33 a pound, despite the prospect of new mines coming into 
production this year and weak demand from the industrialised countries. 
Indeed until the second week of June (one week after Sumitomo started its 
investigation into Hamanaka's trading) the average price for the year was US 
Dollars 1.17.

 The Comision Chilena del Cobre reckons that each one cent move in the 
average price of copper costs the country US Dollars 20m a year. 

 Complaints. Juan Villarzu, Codelco's president, blames the LME for allowing 
the problem to arise. He said that the market had become too speculative. He 
wants rules to make speculation more difficult.

 Villarzu's complaint seems to be a case of sour grapes. Codelco did not 
understand what its futures trader, Juan Pablo Davila was up to three years 
ago when he managed to cost the company US Dollars 175m by doing loss-making 
deals with brokers. Indeed it was the brokers who first alerted Codelco to 
the problem. 

 The brokers seem to have acted similarly in Hamanaka's case. Once they 
started to get strange requests from Hamanaka about the way trades should be 
recorded, they went to the LME with their worries. The LME called in 
Sumitomo which did nothing. 

 The LME has also tried to smooth the copper market by increasing the margin 
requirement from its usual US Dollars 200 a tonne to US Dollars 600; given 
the market's recent volatility such an increase seems warranted. It is 
expected that once the current bout of volatility is over the margin will 
fall back to more normal levels.

 That is right. All markets need a mixture of users and speculators. Without 
the strange combination of two hedge funds (Quantum and Tiger) and a 
Montreal scrap dealer, who all started to short copper on 6 June, a day 
after Sumitomo started its investigation into Hamanaka's trading, the false 
market that had developed in copper would not have been revealed. The 
speculators' action increased the pressure on Sumitomo and Hamanaka as their 
losses increased. When they came clean, the speculators appeared to take 
their profits and leave the market to find its own level. 

 Hedging. Unlike gold mining companies which have used gold loans and other 
techniques to hedge their future production, Codelco seems to have spurned 
the idea of hedging. This may be a legacy of Juan Pablo Davila's activities.

 The company was already feeling the effects of the drop in copper prices in 
its first quarter. Despite a 10% increase in production the company's net 
profits fell by 9% to US Dollars 433m. Its operating profits fell even more 
dramatically, from US Dollars 491m to US Dollars 305m.

 CHILE: CORPORATE PROFILE/IANSA & PATHFINDER: QUITE A SUCCESS STORY: 
Developing from sugar into agribusiness

 The Pathfinder group in Chile, whose shareholders were among the pioneers 
of debt equity swaps in the 1980s, has now carved out a reputation as a 
specialist in turning around ailing Chilean companies has turned its 
attention to Iansa, a troubled fruit company. 

 So successful has Iansa become that Forbes, a US business magazine picked 
it as one of the five best run companies in the country. Pathfinder is 
running Iansa as part of Campos Chilenos. It took over Iansa four years ago.

 Failed first privatisation. The company was founded in 1952 by the state 
holding company Corfo. Its core business was producing sugar from sugar 
beet. As sugar prices were controlled by the state and Corfo's objective was 
to increase agricultural production rather than make money, Iansa wracked up 
losses rather than profits. 

 Once the privatisation bug bit the government in Chile, Iansa was clearly a 
prime candidate for divestiture. Instead of selling the whole of the company 
as a going concern, the government decided to sell three of its five sugar 
plants to two companies. Crav bought two and Compania Industrial one. 

 The sales coincided with a surge in the international sugar price: this 
prompted Crav to start speculating on the futures market just as the sugar 
market turned down. Crav went bust in 1981. Compania Industrial soon 
followed suit. 

 This led the Banco de Estado, which had been the major creditor to the two 
companies, to reassemble the group as it had been before the sales with five 
sugar plants.

 Second shot. The government had another go at selling the company between 
1986 and 1988. This time it sold the company partly through the stockmarket 
and in part directly to other companies. The new owners included: Campos 
Chilenos (which was then owned by famers who supplied Iansa with its raw 
materials and the company's employees); Continental Bank from Chicago; 
Sucden, a French commodity trading company; and Soquimich, a Chilean mining 
company.

 The current general manager of the firm, Ernesto Sahr, told the Chilean 
news magazine Que Pasa, that contrary to what people thought, the second 
privatisation did little to improve the viability of the firm. He said that 
conflicts between shareholders unhinged Iansa's management, marketing and 
financial system. 

 Pathfinder's chance. Pathfinder saw its chance and took it at the end of 
1991 by buying Campos Chilenos, Iansa's controlling shareholder. Sahr said 
that immediately the company's fortune's started to improve. Pathfinder 
built up its stake and now controls 43% of Iansa's shares.

 More importantly, Pathfinder also got the company to change its business. 
The company had originally been set up to help national agriculture, in 
particular sugar producers. Under Pathfinder's management, it had two tasks: 
the first was to dominate the local sugar market. The second was to 
diversify away from relying just on sugar for its money. 

 Challenge. Unlike some managers, who might have decided to move the company 
away from sugar almost immediately, Pathfinder decided that Iansa should try 
to dominate the local sugar market before diversifying.

 Dominating the sugar market was more easily said than done. Unlike most 
developing (and developed) countries, Chile does not protect its domestic 
sugar market with high tariffs.

 This meant that Iansa had to grow by becoming more efficient and 
competitive. First it cut costs, streamlined its management and invested in 
new technology to increase productivity. 

 So successful was Iansa that the low price for sugar in Chile has kept 
other companies out of the market. A kilo of sugar in Chile retails at 
around US Dollars 0.50. In the US, by contrast, a kilo of sugar costs US 
Dollars 1.20. 

 The bottom line. Iansa's strategy has not just delivered low-priced sugar 
to Chilean consumers: it has also delivered a spectacular financial 
performance. 

 In 1993, Iansa's profits increased by 425% (to US Dollars 11.5m) compared 
with 1992. But this was almost nothing compared to what happened in 1995 
when the company's profits shot up to US Dollars 48.5m.

 The main reason for the surge in profits in 1994 and 1995 was record sugar 
production in 1994/95. The company produced 550,000t of sugar: this was 20% 
more than it had produced in the previous season.

 Overall, Iansa has increased sales by an average of 18% a year since it was 
taken over by Pathfinder. 

 Diversification. Pathfinder's plan for Iansa is that it should cease to be 
a one product company but evolve into a diversified agro-industrial company. 
Sahr said that the company realised it was dangerous to depend on sugar, 
whose price can vary dramatically on the international market.

 Iansa first dabbled in agricultural supplies before moving into the tomato 
products market, fruit concentrates and animal feed.

 So successful has the diversification strategy been that Iansa has changed 
its corporate structure. Iansa has now become a parent company with five 
subsidiaries: 

 Iansa still runs the sugar side of the business. This consists of the 
original five plants and the sugar business still accounts for 64% of the 
group's sales. Iansa Peru and Insafrut run the fruit and fruit drink side; 
Iansagro looks after the supply of agricultural services and supplies and 
Biomaster deals with animal feed. Each company has a five year plan that 
calls for the whole group to invest US Dollars 230m. 

 Capital. Such a heavy investment programme has prompted the company to try 
and increase its capital. Originally the company announced that it would 
launch an ADR issue at the end of 1995. This issue has been delayed several 
times. 

 The company says it wants to raise about US Dollars 50m. Its international 
advisers have told it to hold off, despite the fact that the market for ADRs 
is buoyant. Instead the company is now planning a US Dollars 80m debt issue 
in the US.

 The company needs the money partly because of its capital expenditure plans 
and partly because it has international ambitions.

 Iansa is planning to add to its five Chilean plants (Curico, Linares, 
Chillan, Los Angeles and La Union) by buying Argentina's third largest sugar 
company (Ingenio San Martin del Tabacal). It is also interested in buying a 
sugar producer in Peru. 

 These acquisitions are in addition to its plans to build a maize syrup 
plant at Curico. Maize syrup is increasingly replacing sugar as the 
sweetener in soft drinks.

 Iansagro. Iansagro, which accounts for 16% of the group's total sales is 
expanding its business which currently revolves around providing 
agricultural services, especially technology, to beet sugar producers. 

 It is beefing up its operations by opening the first supermarket for 
agricultural products in the country. The fist supermarket will cost US 
Dollars 44m and the company expects to eventually roll out the concept 
throughout the country, if the first pilot store proves successful.

 Biomaster. The group's animal feed subsidiary also has ambitious plans. Its 
main business is providing food for sheep, pets and fish under the brands, 
Doko, Dokat, Cosetan, Melazan and Trucha.

 It is investing in a new US Dollars 10m plant to produce sheep food. It is 
also licensing technology from McCauley Bros from the US.

 Inasafrut & Iansa Peru. This part of the group plans to spend US Dollars 
25m this year on expanding its four plants. It also wants to move into the 
frozen food market and investigate the prospects for selling (and producing 
its) products in Brazil, Argentina and Peru.

 Still on track. According to Que Pasa, the company's business is still 
doing well. It pointed out that in the first quarter of the year profits 
increased by 23%.

 REGION: INFLATION

 As we warned last month the financial markets seem to have overreacted to 
some astute new management by the Mexican authorities. The markets paid the 
penalty for this in June when interest rates stopped falling and even backed 
up slightly, and the stockmarket and exchange rate had one of their rockiest 
periods this year. The markets were also rather annoyed that the inflation 
rate for May (at 1.8%, ostensibly a marked improvement on April), was at the 
top end of expectations. The big worry is food prices, which are beginning 
to rise as the effects of the drought start to hit supplies. Even the OECD 
is now reckoning that inflation this year will be 33%. Over the first five 
months of the year the CPI has risen by 13.5%. 

 Venezuela's inflation rate in May was even higher than April's. The 
government, though, does not seem too concerned, reckoning that the rate 
will subside sharply in the second half of the year. The accumulated rate 
for the first five months of the year is 52%. 

 Ecuador's inflation rate dropped into minus territory after hitting almost 
3% in April. In both Argentina and Brazil, inflation seems well under 
control. Argentina's rate for the first five months of the year is actually 
a fall of 0.7%. Brazil's is a modest 5.25%.

 REGION: INTEREST RATES

 After their sharp falls in April and May, cetes yields trod water for most 
of June, hovering around the 28% mark. This means that Mexican interest 
rates are barely positive. As we keep on saying, interest rates are close to 
being negative on independent forecasts (such as the OECD's) for inflation. 
The government is still reckoning on 22% for the year. 

 In Brazil interest rates started to fall quite sharply in June as inflation 
fears were dispelled and the government took a more relaxed view of the 
currency.

 REGION: EXCHANGE RATES

 The Mexican peso had a much rockier month. The currency which had actually 
appreciated against the dollar fell from 7.4 to 7.6 as investors began to 
fret that the US Federal Reserve Board might start to nudge short term 
interest rates higher. The US economy is clearly growing lustily and there 
is some evidence of tightness in some markets. If US short rates start to 
rise, foreign investors are likely to pull money out of riskier emerging 
markets and keep it closer to home where the yields are almost as good. Only 
when US yields are skimpy do they take a punt on emerging markets.

 PERU: PRIVATISATION: OIL SALES START: AND RESIDUAL TELEFONICA SHARES ON 
sale

 The government was delighted when Refinadores del Peru, a consortium headed 
by Spain's biggest oil company, Repsol, along with Yacimientos Petroliferos 
Fiscales from Argentina and Mobil from the US, won the auction for La 
Pampilla, the country's main oil refinery. This was the first substantial 
sale in the controversial privatisation of the assets of the state-owned oil 
company Petroperu.

 Repsol has a 45% stake in Refinadores. The consortium paid US Dollars 181m, 
well above the underbidder's offer (from Marven of Venezuela) of US Dollars 
166m. The minimum price fixed by the state for its 60% stake had been set at 
US Dollars 108m (of which US Dollars 38m could come in the form of debt 
paper). Besides paying the purchase price, Repsol has committed itself to 
investing a further US Dollars 50m and maintaining production at 102,000bpd. 
The company will take control of the refinery in August. 
 According to a former member of the board of Petroperu, Carlos Repetto, La 
Pampilla's accumulated debt at the end of 1995 was US Dollars 450m and this 
is likely to rise to US Dollars 600m by the end of this year. 

 Public sale. Daniel Hokama, the energy and mining minister, hinted that the 
government might sell its residual 40% stake in the La Pampilla refinery to 
the public through the stockmarket. 

 Hokama said that the world price for a refinery of La Pampilla's size was 
US Dollars 300m and the government had got US Dollars 180 for a 60% stake in 
it.  

 Oilfields. Simultaneous with the sale of La Pampilla was the sale of two 
concessions (blocs 8/8X near Talara and bloc 10 in the Amazonian jungle) 
owned by Petroperu. The 8/8X blocs hold 43m barrels of oil and the 
government set a minimum price of US Dollars 75m with a commitment to invest 
a further US Dollars 25m.

 The field was awarded to a consortium headed by Plus Petrol from Argentina 
with smaller stakes held by two Korean companies, Daewoo and Padco and a 
Canadian company, Yukon. The consortium paid US Dollars 142m for the field.  

 The first phase of Petroperu's privatisation occurred in 1992 when 78 of 
its petrol stations were sold and the company was broken up into bits that 
could be sold more easily.

 The parts that remain to be sold are Petrolube, the two main refiners are 
La Pampilla and Talara as well as the other two at Conchan and Iquitos and 
the oil pipeline. The oil pipeline, like the refinery at Iquitos, will be 
offered as a 20-year concession rather than completely sold.

 Telefonica. On 10 June the government then launched its international share 
offering for its residual stake in the telephone company, Telefonica del 
Peru. In February 1994, Telefonica de Espana bought 35% in each of the two 
state telephone companies (Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones and the 
Compania Peruana de Telefonos) for a total of US Dollars 2bn.

 The government's residual offering is designed to raise US Dollars 1.2bn. 
The government hopes to sell 50% of the shares in the US, 35% in Europe and 
the balance in Asia and Latin America.

 The government holds a residual stake of 28.6%, but it only wants to sell 
23% of its shares. It is also embarking on an ambitious programme to boost 
local shareholdings in the company.

 Tell Sid. In the first week of June, before the international marketing 
effort started, 20,000 individual Peruvians placed orders for shares. The 
government had hoped to interest a total of between 60,000 and 80,000 
Peruvians and raise US Dollars 200m. It looks as though these targets will 
be beaten.

 On 10 June, the government started its marketing programme to institutional 
investors in Peru. These investors range from the pension funds to insurance 
companies and  corporate and individual investors who place orders of at 
least 20,000 soles (US Dollars 8,300). The government has pencilled in 
takings of US Dollars 50m from institutional investors.

 The government has high hopes of building on the initial success of the 
telephone sale to promote shareholding to retail investors. Prime minister 
Alberto Pandolfi said he hoped there would be 400,000 individual 
sharehodlers in privatised companies by 1998.

 Proceeds: The Peruvian government said that it had received US Dollars 
4.6bn from privatisation between 1993 until the sale of La Pampilla. In 
addition, the new owners of companies had promised to invest a further US 
Dollars 5bn. The government reckons that it will raise a further US Dollars 
4.6bn from sales this year and next. 

 Fishmeal: Pescaperu, the state-owned fishing company, is selling six 
fishmeal factories and three fishoil refineries for at least US Dollars 40m. 
The company began issuing prospectuses at the end of May. Potential 
purchasers will have to put 40% down but can pay the rest in quarterly 
payments for two and half years plus an interest rate of 2% over six-month 
Libor. 

 Gold: The government says that it will sell the Quicay gold deposit, 
belonging to the state-owned Centromin, in mid-July. The minimum price is US 
Dollars 5m. The deposit holds a minimum of 3m ounces of ore with an average 
gold content of 0.3g a tonne. 

 Shougang: The government is holding talks with the Chinese company which 
bought HierroPeru about investment plans. Shougang has failed to meet the 
terms of the agreement it signed when it bought  HierroPeru in 1993. 
Shougang had promised to invest US Dollars 150m in two years, but did not do 
so by the end of 1995. The government said that it cannot take action 
against Shougang because the contract did not allow for it. Shougang has 
apprently offered to invest US Dollars 300m in a new pellets factory, which 
will also be able to handle copper.

 BRAZIL: CVRD: SOLD AS ONE: SAYS BNDES PRESIDENT

 Luis Carlos Mendoza de Barros, president of the Banco Nacional de 
Desenvolvimento Economico, said the country's biggest mining company, 
Companhia Vale Do Rio Doce, would not be broken up before it was privatised. 
The company, which is currently composed of 40 subsidiaries, is likely to 
fetch around US Dollars 12bn. 

 Mendoza de Barros said the government had now dropped the idea of selling 
the company in parts because so many of its subsidiaries had complementary 
activities.

 He also told the senate committee, before whom he was testifying, that the 
government would ensure CVRD's main rivals and customers in the iron ore 
business would be barred from bidding. CVRD is the world's biggest producer 
of iron ore and Latin America's biggest gold producer. 

 Although mining is its main activity, the company also controls transport 
systems, especially railways, roads and shipping, power stations and is 
involved in the lumbering industry. 

 Cellular: The communications minister, Sergio Motta, announced that the 
state-owned companies offering cellular services would start to be 
privatised from 1997. He said that the companies which used Band A would be 
lumped into between seven and 10 regional groupings and then sold. 

 The minister said that companies bidding for Band B wavelengths in specific 
areas would also have to bid for the local Band A company. 

 He also said the state-owned telecoms company would be privatised by the 
end of President Cardoso's mandate. This ends on 31 December 1998. 

 Maracana: The state government in Rio de Janeiro has put the famous 
Maracana soccer stadium up for sale. It is offering the stadium, which costs 
US Dollars 10m a year to run, on a 30-year concession. It has advertising 
receipts of around US Dollars 7m a year and collects US Dollars 120,000 in 
ticket sales from the derbies between Flemingo and Fluminense. The stadium 
is built to take 180,000 spectators but its capacity has recently been 
limited to 120,000. The state government reckons that the new management 
will have to spend between US Dollars 60m and US Dollars 70m on remodelling 
the stadium which was built in 1950. 

 Light: A consortium headed by Electricite de France in partnership with AES 
and Houston Power Industries bought control of Light, the electricity 
distribution company for the state of Rio de Janeiro. The government sold 
60% of the shares for US Dollars 2.2bn, the minimum set by the government. 
The consortium bought a 34% stake while 20% was bought by Brazilian groups 
and 6% was left unsold. 

 The government must be relieved to have sold Light. It had tried to sell it 
three times previously, but had been thwarted by potential investors' 
worries about litigation over the way the company adjusted bills in the era 
of hyper-inflation. 

 Initially the company was valued at US Dollars 3.7bn. Even at the new 
price, potential bidders, notably Chilectra, thought the price was too high 
for 60% of the shares in the company. 

 Telecoms: The Americas Telecom 96 trade fair in Rio de Janeiro has drawn 
360 equipment manufacturers. This is a substantial increase on the numbers 
attending the two previous fairs in 1988 and 1992, and organisers say this 
reflects the increased international interest in the industry in the region.

 Brazil's telecoms market, which becomes properly free in 1998, is worth 
around US Dollars 30bn a year. Thanks to a constitutional amendment passed 
last year, foreign companies will now be allowed to supply services such as 
cellular phones. Previously the state had a monopoly.

 According to the Union Internacional de Telecomunicaciones, which organises 
the trade fair, Brazil will go from having 14m conventional telephones and 
2m cellular phones in 1995 to 40m conventional telephones and 17m cellular 
phones by 2003. 

 In Argentina, where the privatisation of telecommunications is virtually 
concluded, the country has 20 lines per 100 people. In Brazil the figure is 
12.

 Venezuela: Elia Ynati, president of the Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana, 
said that the aluminium industry would be put up for sale in November. He 
said that three companies had already expressed an interest in buying the 
companies in which the CVG is the principal shareholder. The state-owned 
aluminium companies have debts of US Dollars 1.3bn, of which about half is 
owed to foreign banks.

 El Salvador: Morgan Stanley and Citibank have won the contract to advise 
the government on the sale of the telecoms company, Administracion Nacional 
de Telecomunicaciones (Antel). The government has agreed a fee of 0.74% with 
the two banks, which will design and market the privatisation. The sale is 
controversial since the company is profitable and its 6,000 workers say 
their jobs are at risk if the company is privatised.

 Mexico: The government has been forced to delay its sale of the 
petrochemical plants. The delay has been caused by a range of factors: legal 
conflicts, pressure from the opposition and from oilworkers. The government 
had hoped to raise US Dollars 2bn from the sale of the petrochemicals 
industry.

 Privatisation under the current administration has been slow: only the four 
port terminals have been sold for US Dollars 165m. 

 The government is now trying to drum up interest in the railways. There are 
32 foreign companies interested in buying bits of the system which loses 
around US Dollars 140m a year.

 Paraguay: The IMF's managing director met trade unionists who said that he 
believed privatisation should be more flexible. Unions had held a general 
strike to protest against the sale of the steel company, Acepar. The 
government, which has sold only two state companies to date, is currently 
trying to sell the Flota Mercante Paraguaya.

 MEXICO: DEBT PAGE:PREPAYING THE US: US DOLLARS 4.7BN

 Mexico has prepaid almost half the money it borrowed from the US ahead of 
schedule. On 19 June the government announced that it had prepaid US Dollars 
4.7bn the previous day. 

 The Mexican government borrowed a total of US Dollars 12.5bn from the US. 
The US had offered a credit line of up to US Dollars 20bn.

 The Mexican government said that it had borrowed some of the money it used 
to repay the US from a syndicate of international banks headed by JP Morgan 
and Swiss Bank Corporation. The Mexican government said that the new loan 
was significantly cheaper than the money provided by the US and also had a 
longer maturity: 10 years instead of three and a half. Mexican officials 
reckoned that refinancing the loans from the US Treasury will save the 
country around US Dollars 50m a year in interest payments. 

 Over the first five months of the year Mexico has been a heavy borrower 
from the international capital markets. It has borrowed a total of US 
Dollars 7.4bn, bankers say.

 Mexico's total debt at the end of the first quarter was US Dollars 172bn. 
On some calculations Mexico's foreign  debt service burden this year is the 
equivalent of 14.5% of GDP. In 1995 it was 9.5% and in 1994 6%. 

 Eugenia Correa, a researcher at the economics faculty at the Universidad 
Autonoma de Mexico, reckons that the equivalent of 24% of GDP is being spent 
on sorting out the country's debt problems. This takes into account bank 
debts, domestic debt, and foreign debt. In dollar terms, she claims that 
this figure is US Dollars 73bn.

 Oil security. The new money does apparently have a hidden cost. Just as the 
US loan was secured against Mexican oil receipts so is (reportedly) the JP 
Morgan/Swiss Bank Corporation deal. Until the US-led rescue package last 
year, Mexico had refused to pledge its oil receipts. 

 The Mexican government though claims that there is no pledge over oil 
receipts and that the loan in fact gives Mexico greater freedom to use its 
oil revenues. 

 Cuba: The Cuban government is the latest in the region to admit that it 
needs to do something about its foreign debt. It owes US Dollars 9bn. Unlike 
other countries in the region Cuba is not a member of the IDB, the IMF or 
the World Bank and therefore does not have access to cheap credit to help to 
set up a debt reduction deal. 

 According to figures issued by the Banco Nacional de Cuba, the country's 
foreign debt at the end of 1995 stood at US Dollars 9.1bn, or US Dollars 
500m more than at the end of 1994. 

 Although European countries  account for the bulk of the country's debt, 
Argentina is also a major creditor, owed US Dollars 1.3bn. According to 
central bank officials, the US Dollars 9bn figure does not include the 
country's debts to the former Soviet Union and other Comecon countries. 
These debts are said to be large and unquantifiable. 

 Cuba stopped paying its foreign dent in 1986 as part of a campaign led by 
Fidel Castro to protest against the high cost of servicing foreign debts. 

 Cuba is now trying to build bridges with its creditors. It has held talks 
with banks and banking authorities in Japan, Spain, France and Britain. 
Bankers say that the talks have been wide ranging, including ideas such as 
debtswaps. 

 Cuba's inability to tap the international capital markets means that it has 
been forced into short term loans to finance its sugar crop. It is said to 
have borrowed US Dollars 300m to finance the 1995/96 crop which has barely 
hit the production target of 4.5m t. The danger of missing the target is 
that Cuba will be unable to sell as much sugar as it hoped on the 
international market. It has swaps with China and Russia to satisfy first. 

 Honduras: Eduardo Villanueva, fiscal for cultural affairs, claims that 
according to some optimistic researchers, the San Roque galleon which sank 
off Honduras in 1606 has enough gold and silver on it to clear the country's 
foreign debt. He said that the country should take special care of these 
rich shipwrecks. The San Roque was the flagship of a treasure fleet and 
apparently held 180 boxes of gold and silver coins; 250 silver bars and 100 
gold bars. The government says that it has located the site of the wreck. 
The site is believed to be close to the Bay Islands. 

 IDB: The IDB has made its first ever loan to the private sector to help 
finance a 2,180 metre tunnel through the El Corvocado mountain in Rio de 
Janeiro. The borrower is OAS, which has won the concession for a 15km 
Amarelo underground line.

 HONDURAS: THE GRAINS PROBLEM: FROM EXPORTER TO IMPORTER

 The President, Roberto Reina, has approved an emergency plan to deal with 
the scarcity of staple grains. The core of the plan involves setting up a 
committee, headed by Guatama Fonsea, a member of congress for the ruling 
Partido Liberal.  

 The country has had problems with growing its own staple foods for the past 
couple of years, following  changes introduced by the previous government of 
Rafael Callejas which its opponents say encouraged local producers to export 
rather than sell in the local market. Last year the harvest increased by 
1.9% but demand grew by 3.5%, the government said. The grains tend to go to 
neighbouring countries (El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua) where local 
prices are higher than those in the Honduran market. 

 Already the government has had to import 1,500t of beans (at a cost of US 
Dollars 1m) from Canada. The government has set aside US Dollars 5m to buy 
staples (beans, maize and wheat) from international markets. 

 Maquila. The government and the textile industry is beefing up its campaign 
to stop the US penalising goods made in Honduras because of the bleak labour 
conditions at textile factories in Honduras. Last month it sent a mission to 
testify to the US Senate headed by the economy minister, Fernando Garcia and 
Cecilio Zavala, the labour minister.

 Honduran industrialists say that Charles Keraghan, head of the human rights 
committee of the National Labor Commission is behind the lurid, usually 
televised, 'investigative' programmes about textile maquilas in Honduras and 
the rest of Central America. Textile producers in the region claim that the 
US textile industry, which just wants to use maquilas for bits of the 
clothes-making process, is behind the campaign. They say that the US 
industry wants to prevent a textile industry, using non-US raw materials, 
developing in Central America. 

 The industry is important. It employs between 60,000 and 70,000 people, 
mostly in Korean and Taiwanese factories around San Pedro Sula in the north 
of the country. Textile exports were worth US Dollars 186m to Honduras last 
year and are likely to grow to US Dollars 220m this year.

 NICARAGUA: INFLATION PICKS UP: BUT ECONOMY ON COURSE, ACCORDING TO CENTRAL 
bank

 The president of the central bank, Evenor Taboada, said that although 
inflation picked up in May, the economy was doing rather well. He said that 
the government had more than met the targets it set itself of increasing 
reserves, increasing public sector deposits at the central bank and getting 
the private banks to finance this year's crop. 

 Taboada blamed the increase in inflation on an increase in the price of 
perishables. This pressure would ebb, he said, in the second half of the 
year.

 The pressure here will come from the politicians as the country gears up 
for the presidential elections scheduled for 20 October. It now seems likely 
that all 22 candidates will be ruled eligible by the Consejo Supremo 
Electoral: there had been allegations of unfitness made against five of 
them, including three of the key candidates, Arnoldo Aleman, the former 
mayor of Managua, Daniel Ortega, the former Sandinista president and Antonio 
Lacayo, the current President's son-in-law. Opinion polls suggest Aleman is 
currently leading.

 PANAMA: GROWTH STEADY: BUT SHRIMPS IMPROVE

 The economy grew by 3% in the first quarter of this year, but most 
independent economists expect the rate to fall back to between 1% and 2% for 
the year, because of the complicated political situation. 

 Economic statistics in the country are easily distorted: bananas account 
for half of the country's total agricultural output. Exports for the first 
four months of the year were 11.6m boxes, up 2.7% on the same period of 
1995. Meat production is just holding its own: in the first three months of 
the year 70,126 head of cattle were slaughtered. This was virtually the same 
number as in the first quarter of 1995. Shrimp production on the other hand 
is doing well. In the first two months of the year it was 13% up on the same 
period of 1995. 

 Although the consumption of electricity in the first quarter at 956m KW 
hours was 9% above the level for the same period of 1995, the industrial 
consumption index, at 128, was only two points above the level of the 
previous year. Construction, though, seems to be doing well. The issuance of 
licences was worth US Dollars 77m in the first quarter: that is 10% more 
than for the first quarter of 1995. 

 Canal traffic was also healthy in the first quarter. It was 57.8m t or 5.3% 
more than for the same period of 1995. The free-zone in Colon though is 
seeing lower volumes of re-exports. 

 What is depressing, though, is retail sales. At US Dollars 212m for the 
first two months of the year, these were 13% below 1995's figures. Tourism 
on the other hand was up by 50% at 72,000.

 The government is running a growing deficit. Spending in February was 26% 
up on the comparable month of 1995 at US Dollars 267m. Revenues were 2% up 
at US Dollars 210m.

 Although unemployment remains comparatively high at 14% (for February) this 
actually represents an improvement on the figure for the comparable months 
of 1995.

 PARAGUAY: DEFICIT PROBLEM: WARNS IMF

 The IMF says that the government must take action to lower the fiscal 
deficit if the country's economic prospects are to improve. The Fund says 
that it fears a renewed upsurge in inflation in Paraguay if the public 
sector deficit is not brought under cotrol swiftly.

 The Fund reckons that dealing with the problem should not be too difficult. 
It says that the increase in public spending this year is largely due to 
higher personnel costs. According to the fund, the public sector's personnel 
costs have doubled over the past six years and amounted to 8.5% of GDP in 
1995.

 The Fund also notes that some of the increase in public spending has been 
due to sorting out the financial system. It reckons that the bulk of the 
money has now been spent and that the recently approved banking law should 
start to settle things down again.

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO: WRITING OFF: MOST OF THE LOANS TO GUYANA

 The government has decided, to the fury of the opposition, to write off 
most of the US Dollars 536m debt Guyana has run up with Trinidad & Tobago. 
The government has decided to write off US Dollars 357m and reschedule 
repayment of the remaining US Dollars 179m over 23 years. 

 Keith Rowley, from the opposition People's National Movement says that the 
write off is unnecessary: he would have preferred the debt to have been 
swapped for some of Guyana's forestry, rice fields or gold mining 
concessions.

 The government said that it was bound by the terms of the Paris Club 
meeting which it attended (and where it found itself to be Guyana's biggest 
creditor, above the US, Britain, Holland, Germany, France, Norway and 
Denmark). Trinidad started to lend large amounts to Guyana in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s when it was flush with oil revenues. 

 Neal & Massy. The stockmarket was surprised at the end of May at the 
decision by Neal and Massy's management to take provisions of T&T Dollars 
100m against a restructuring of the conglomerate. The company is closing or 
selling most of its lossmaking divisions to raise money to reduce 
borrowings.

 The company which is a major conglomerate operating in both Trinidad and 
Jamaica, has been under pressure for the past three years since it bought T. 
Geddes Grant. Stockbrokers say that it failed to integrate this company 
(which had companies in several of Neal and Massy's businesses) and allowed 
debt to balloon to nearly T&T Dollars 800m.

 URUGUAY: CONSTRUCTION PLANS: AND SCANDALS

 The president of the Camara de la Construcccion de Uruguay, Ignacio Otegui, 
has asked the government to take measures to reduce the red-tape which he 
says is preventing the industry from recovering. The construction industry, 
traditionally one of the engines of the economy, has been in recession for 
the past 18 months or so. 

 In 1995 the construction industry contracted by 15% as Argentine investment 
in Uruguay dried up. Since the end of the year the industry has continued to 
decline, throwing around 1,500 people out of work a month. 

 Otegui wants the government just to get on with the projects that have been 
already authorised. He said that announcing new projects or increased 
investment would not be as helpful as simply signing contracts and getting 
authorised projects moving.

 Otegui said that currently the industry reckons that it takes between eight 
and 12 months for prices, tendering systems and subcontracting arrangements 
to be agreed on projects for the public sector. 

 Inflation: In May prices rose by 2.1%, bringing the figure for the first 
five months of the year to 10.8%. More encouraging is the wholesale price 
index. It rose by just 1% in May and is currently registering 26% for the 
past 12 months. Although farm food prices fell by almost 2% as meat and wool 
prices dropped, processed food prices actually rose. This reflects the 
increase in grain and oilseeds prices. 

 Opinion polls: Support for President Julio Maria Sanguinetti hit a new low 
in May, according to a poll for the daily El Observador. It found that only 
18% of Uruguayans thought he was doing well, while 50% thought he was doing 
a poor job. The main criticism of his policies was economic: respondents 
complained of not being able to find jobs and of the sharp increases in 
prices. 

 Scandal: Ramifications from the Focoex scandal seem to be spreading. At the 
heart of the scandal are allegations that members of the former Lacalle 
government misused a US Dollars 200m line of credit from Spain to pay 
extortionate prices for basic goods. A congressional committee has already 
been set up to investigate the accusations which are being led by Leonardo 
Nicolini from the left wing opposition, the Frente Amplio. He has already 
suffered counter-suits for libel and damages from those he has accused of 
corruption.

 The allegations of corruption started nine months ago. The latest people to 
be tarred by the allegations are a former presidential secretary, Pablo 
Garcia Pintos, a former president of Obras Sanitarias del Estado, Villanueva 
Saravia, a former transport minister (who is currently a member of congress) 
Juan Carlos Raffo, and a former economy minister and central bank president, 
Enrique Braga. Braga has already disproved allegations that there were 
irregularities in the way a bank was sold during his time in office.

 BRAZIL: COFFEE: WHY THE DROP IN EXPORTS MAY BE STRUCTURAL: RATHER THAN JUST 
temporary

 The world's biggest coffee producer, Brazil, reports that its coffee 
exports in the first four months of the year were the lowest for five years 
at 2.27m bags. This was 37.5% down on the comparable period of 1995.

 Most analysts attribute the fall to the problems caused by the frosts in 
the winter of 1994. These cut the crop in 1994/1995 to 12.5m bags and the 
1995/1996 crop to 14m bags. The expectation though is for a much bigger crop 
in 1996/97, which is currently on the trees. 

 The official forecast is for a crop of 28m bags. Independent analysts go 
for 25m bags. 

 Important though the frost damage is, it could be masking a structural 
change in the Brazilian coffee industry. As Oswaldo Aranha, president of the 
Federacao Brasileira dos Exportadores do Cafe, said, another reason for the 
fall in Brazilian exports has been that domestic prices for coffee are now 
higher than the international price. This has led, he said, to a shift from 
exports to the domestic market. 

 Indeed the domestic market is recovering strongly. In 1995, thanks to the 
real plan which helped restore Brazilians' purchasing power, domestic 
consumption of coffee increased by 9%. This bucked the world trend of lower 
coffee consumption. 

 In 1995 world demand for coffee dropped from 96.6m (60kg) bags to 93.2m. In 
the US, the world's biggest consumer, coffee consumption dropped by 6%.

 Interestingly, the increase in Brazilian consumption is not a one-off. 
Consumption has been growing steadily since it fell to 2.3kg a head in 1980. 
A decade earlier it had been 4.6kg. In 1995 consumption was just under 3kg a 
head. US consumption is 4kg a head. 

 If the current trend continues in Brazil, the domestic coffee market could 
be using about 15m bags a year by the end of century, up from its current 
consumption of 10m bags. Even now coffee traders say that Brazil might have 
to import more coffee to meet domestic demand since the 14m bag (1995/96) 
crop plus the 7m bags in store will not be enough to both meet export 
commitments and keep the domestic market supplied. 

 The Asociacao Brasileira de la Industria do Cafe reckons that if domestic 
consumption does increase to 15m bags a year, the country's coffee crop will 
have to be 35m bags. 

 Exports. The dismal figure for exports in April, (512,468 bags) meant that 
Brazil's exports have now been below 1m bags for seven months in a row.

 The country has exported only half of its quota granted by the Association 
of Coffee Producing Countries. The quota is supposed to compel countries to 
hold back 20% of their production from the market in an effort to drive up 
international prices.

 The fall in export volumes (and the weak international price) has 
diminished export revenues. In April, revenues were a mere US Dollars 82m 
compared with US Dollars 185m in April 1995. In the first four months of the 
year export revenues were US Dollars 331m, compared with US Dollars 641m in 
the same period of 1995. 

 Colombia: The Colombian coffee crop has been badly damaged by heavy rains. 
The Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros now says that the country expects a 
crop of 10.6m bags for the year starting in June 1996. Originally Colombia 
had forecast a crop of 12.5m bags.

 In 1995, the country exported 9.8m bags, 17% less than in 1994. Revenues 
were US Dollars 1.9bn. 

 Mexico: The country now expects a crop of 4.7m bags. It says that it will 
export 3.8m to North America.

 Honduras: Although the Instituto Hondureno del Cafe expects the 1995/96 
crop to have increased from 2.5m (40kg) bags to 3.2m it does not expect 
revenues to follow suit. In fact it expects them to fall from last year's US 
Dollars 320m to around US Dollars 300m. 

 Nicaragua: Alvaro Velazquez, from the Comision Nicarag***uense del Cafe 
says that the country should be able to sell all of its exportable coffee 
from the next (1996/97) crop. He expects the country to harvest 792,000 
(60kg) bags and to be able to export 707,100 (60kg) bags. He says that the 
quota given by the ACPC was equal to total production. At current prices 
that volume of exports would produce US Dollars 110m in revenues. 

 Dominican Republic: The country expects to export 574,752 (40kg) bags in 
1995/96. This will earn around US Dollars 56m according to Jose Antonio 
Martinez from the Comision Nacional del Cafe at the agriculture ministry.

 Quotas: Brazil has been awarded a quota of 15m bags by the ACPC for the 
year starting in July 1996. Colombia has a quota of 10.65m bags. The ACPC is 
trying to get both Mexico and Guatemala to sign up. On 15 June, Central 
America, Ecuador and Colombia asked for their quotas to be modified. They 
want to move 254,000 bags from the first to the second half of the year. 
Colombia wants to move 100,000 bags from the final quarter of this year to 
the first of next year in order to match its production to its quota.

 Ecuador: The country's coffee revenues more than halved in the first four 
months of 1996, compared with the same period of 1995. They dropped from US 
Dollars 46m to US Dollars 22m. The fall in coffee revenues was paralleled by 
falls in revenues from oil, wood and shrimps. Yet overall the country's 
export revenues rose in the first four months of the year to US Dollars 
1.46bn from US Dollars 1.44bn in the same period of 1995. The main increase 
was in manufactures, which rose from US Dollars 267m in the first third of 
1995 to US Dollars 309m in the same period of 1996.

 ARGENTINA: AGRICULTURE: ON THE UP: LAND PRICES JUMP BY 30%

 Falling grain production in the US and a drop in supplies from the EU 
coupled with increased demand from Asia has led to a jump in land prices in 
Argentina. Land agents say that the price of arable land has jumped by 
between 30% and 50% over the past eight months.

 According to land agents the price of land suitable for wheat in the 
province of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe and Cordoba) has jumped from 
between US Dollars 1,000 and US Dollars 1,500 a hectare eight months ago to 
US Dollars 2,500 and US Dollars 3,500 now. Rents have also increased: they 
have gone up from US Dollars 100 a month in the Pampas to US Dollars 150. 

 The increase in prices follows the surge in wheat prices: these have gone 
from US Dollars 150 a tonne in May 1995 to just under US Dollars 200. 
Meanwhile maize prices have jumped from US Dollars 100 to US Dollars 172 a 
tonne. Soya has also jumped from an average of US Dollars 190 a tonne to US 
Dollars 275. 

 Raquel Camino, from the Centro de la Industria Aceitera de Argentina says 
that the increase in land prices reflects the effect of the Uruguay round 
which has cut the export subsidies farmers in the US and the EU used to 
enjoy. Coupled with poor weather (notably drought in the US), prices have 
risen sharply. 

 Even the beef crisis in Europe has helped to increase grain prices. Poultry 
and pigs eat more maize and soya than cows.

 Argentine officials expect the country to harvest 60m t of grain this year 
and export revenues to top US Dollars 7.5bn. Of these US Dollars 5bn will 
come from the export of oilseeds (principally soya and sunflowers).

 Some investors have already done well. George Soros, the man who forced 
sterling out of the EMS and whose aggressive shorting of the copper market 
may have prompted Sumitomo to crystallise a US Dollars 1.8bn loss, bought 
350,000 hectares of Argentine land 18 months ago. 

 The government says that the strong grain prices have led to increased 
demand for fertilisers and agricultural machinery.

 Downside. The downside to the delight of arable farmers is the grim 
position of stock farmers. They have been hit by the worldwide fall in 
demand for beef following the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) scare 
in Europe.  

 This problem with BSE has offset the benefits Argentina has won by being 
declared free of foot-and-mouth disease, which had limited its exports. 

 Humberto Volando, president of the Federacion Agraria Argentina, the forum 
for small farmers, said that lots of small farmers were getting rid of their 
animals and switching to growing crops. 

 Wool: Sheep farmers in the south of Argentina say that the country's wool 
production will drop by 30% because of the effect of a drought. 

 Bananas: Banana revenues in the first four months of the year increased to 
US Dollars 317m from US Dollars 308m in the same period if 1995. Export 
volumes fell by 6% (compared with April 1995) to 349,160t. Revenues in April 
though were up from US Dollars 79m to US Dollars 84m.   

 Fishing: The Chilean government has reaffirmed its support for the New York 
Agreement on deep sea rights. Chile has the world's fourth biggest fishing 
industry and the sector's exports last year were worth US Dollars 1.7bn. Of 
that 88% was generated by fishmeal. The agreement will give Chile the right 
to vet deep sea fishing vessels which catch fish that generally come inside 
Chile's 200 mile limit. 

 Fishing industry executives are less keen on the agreement because in 
return for the right to vet vessels outside the 200 mile zone, Chile will 
lose exclusive rights over its own zone. It will also come under pressure to 
allow foreign vessels to use its ports. 

 Chile has already taken a strong line on factory ships fishing for horse 
mackerel and hake. The number of such ships has been cut from 120 in 1991 to 
just 18 now, thanks to its licensing system. 

 Sugar: The Cuban sugar crop is still creeping towards the official target 
of 4.5m t. At the end of May production stood at 4.4m t. The government said 
that it was happy to have increased production by a third and has set a 
target of 5m t for 1996/97. Officials say financing for this crop has 
already been arranged: this will allow increased imports of fertilisers and 
other inputs. President Fidel Castro said that the country had borrowed US 
Dollars 300m for the last harvest and had to pay an interest  bill of US 
Dollars 50m for the privilege.

 MEXICO: OIL: PRODUCTION UP BY 7% IN FIRST THIRD: EXPORT PRICES INCREASED

 The state oil company, Pemex, reported that its production in the first 
four months of the year was 6.5% higher than for the same period of 1995. 
The company said that it produced an average of 2.79m bpd of oil. 

 The company said that its average production of heavy oil was 1.34m bpd 
while production of light Isthmus oil ran at 922,000bpd and extra light 
Olmeca at 582,000bpd.

 The country's main oilfield remains the Campeche Basin. It accounted for 
2.06m bpd of the total production. The southern production area (Tabasco and 
Chiapas) generated 634,000bpd while the northern production area produced 
96,000bpd. 

 Exports. The company said that its exports averaged 1.5m bpd. average daily 
exports were 837,400bpd of heavy Maya crude; 185,800bpd of Isthmus and 
480,300bpd of Olmeca. 

 At the beginning of June, the company increased the price of its oil sold 
in the US and Europe but reduced the price of its heavy crude exported to 
the Far East. 

 One constraint on exports, according to Cristian Javelly, the deputy 
manager for international marketing at Pemex, is the company's shortage of 
storage capacity. He said that the company would build two natural gas 
storage facilities in the south of the country.

 Gas. Pemex's gas production in the first third of the year was 4.247bn 
cubic feet a day. This was 17% up on the same period of 1995. The bulk of 
the gas production was in the southern production area which produced 2bn 
cubic feet a day. The Sonda de Campeche produced 1.5bn cubic feet a day 
while the northern zone produced 609m cubic feet a day.

 Politics. The clericalist opposition party, the Partido Accion Nacional, is 
putting pressure on the government to take a tough line on offshore oil 
reserves in the north of the Gulf of Mexico. The PAN wants the government to 
declare that its territorial waters extend for 200 miles. 

 The issue has suddenly become important because Shell, Amoco, Mobil and 
Texaco have all started to drill exploratory wells in an area that could be 
claimed by Mexico. The foreign ministry is playing down the issue saying 
that the wells appear to lie beyond Mexican territorial waters, though they 
could be tapping Mexican oilfields.

 The issue of territorial waters has been left on the back burner since 
1976, when the US Senate refused to recognise Mexico's decision to increase 
its territorial waters to 200 miles. This issue has now become tricky 
because studies by Shell and the other oil companies reckon that the dispute 
area could hold between 5bn and 22bn barrels of oil and 45 trillion cubic 
feet of natural gas.

 A PAN senator, Angel Conchelo, said that Mexico could be entitled to 75% of 
this oil. The fact that the oil companies are drilling to depths of 7,625ft, 
suggests that they may well be tapping into fields which lie predominantly 
in Mexican territory. 

 Tabasco: The government has said that only 9% of the left-wing opposition 
Partido de la Revolucion Democratica's claims of environmental damage done 
by the oil industry in Tabasco are true. The PRD had lodged 19,766 protests. 

 The protests had led to the blockading of 20 oil wells in January and 
February. In order to end the unrest both the government and the PRD agreed 
to abide by the judgment of a committee composed of officials from the 
energy, environment, agriculture, agricultural reform and communications 
ministries and the Comision Nacional del Agua and the Procuraduria Federal 
de Proteccion al Ambiente y los Asuntos Agarios.

 The government has yet to say what action it will take over the protests it 
considers to be justified.

 PERU: GAS: CAMISEA: BACK ON

 The government says that it has reached an agreement with Shell and Mobil 
to develop the Camisea gas deposit. This was discovered by Shell in 1983, 
but its development has been in abeyance since then because of its 
remoteness and the previous government's hostility to foreign investment. 

 Some points of the deal remain unclear. The foreign companies will invest 
between US Dollars 2.7bn and US Dollars 2.8bn to develop the deposit. Their 
concession will last for 40 years.

 What is still not clear is what will happen to the gas. The Peruvian 
government says that the country will now become a net hydrocarbons 
exporter. Yet Shell is not absolutely committed to building a gas pipeline, 
either to Lima or to Bolivia to connect to the Bolivian-Brazilian natural 
gas pipeline. Indeed the Shell-Mobil consortium is only committed to 
spending US Dollars 200m over the next two years to drill three exploratory 
wells. The development phase of the project only starts in 1998 and is 
budgeted at US Dollars 2.5bn. Yet without a pipeline, it is hard to see the 
foreign companies investing such amounts.  

 Camisea contains, according to official figures, 12.2bn cubic feet of 
natural gas and 610m barrels of gas liquids. This is worth, oilmen say, 
about US Dollars 70bn. 

 Camisea's oil reserves are equivalent to 2.2bn barrels, or seven times 
Peru's current reserves.
Output. The country's oil output in May, at 3.7m barrels (119,345bpd), was 
6% below the figure for May 1995. Overall in the first five months of the 
year production was 5% down on the same period of 1995 at 17.9m (or 
117,763bpd). Occidental is the biggest single oil producer in Peru 
contributing 1.66m barrels. It is followed by the recently sold bloc 8 which 
pumped 776,841 barrels. 

 Gas production is also down in the first five months at 3,758m cubic feet. 
This is 7.4% down on the same period of 1995.

 ECUADOR: OIL: HOLDING STEADY: BUT NO EFFECT FROM HIGHER PRICES

 Ecuador has not benefitted from the higher-than-expected oil prices in the 
first half of the year. In the first four months of the year, its oil export 
revenues actually fell, though by only US Dollars 2m to US Dollars 464m. 

 This was despite a 4% increase in oil production in the first quarter of 
the year to 35.4m barrels (389,000bpd). Petroecuador, the state oil company, 
produces 81% of the country's oil. Around 60% of Ecuador's oil production is 
exported. 

 The only month which seemed to have benefitted from the higher price was 
March where revenues reached US Dollars 124m, the highest since October 
1995. 

 The government announced that it would invest US Dollars 418m in the 
modernisation of the oil industry. Of this US Dollars 100m will go on 
increasing the capacity of the main TransEcuadorean pipeline from 350,000bpd 
to 380,000bpd. 

 The expansion of the Esmeraldas oil refinery (from 90,000bpd to 110,000bpd) 
will cost US Dollars 180m. Of that US Dollars 77m will be spent in the 
current year.

 The government is also spending US Dollars 2m on producing unleaded fuel. 
It reckons that this investment should be enough to meet the entire domestic 
demand. 

 The government is also embarking upon a US Dollars 72m project to increase 
gas production from the Amazon fields. The government has also agreed a deal 
with Energy Development Corporation for the exploration and production of 
gas in the Gulf of Guayaquil. The country has been trying to do such a deal 
to develop the gas resources in the Gulf for 25 years. 

 EDC is committed to spend US Dollars 45m over four years to explore for 
gas. The government offered a concession to a consortium in 1968 but this 
was suspended in 1972. Northwest Energy was awarded a concession in 1974 but 
this lapsed after five years when the government reckoned that Northwest had 
not met the terms of the contract. BHP King Ranch thought it had won a 
concession in 1995, but this was struck out by the Consejo para la 
Evaluacion de Licitaciones.  

 Court case: The Frente de la Defensa de la Amazonia has warned President 
Sixto Duran-Ballen to stay out of the court case it has started in New York 
against Texaco. The Frente is suing Texaco for the environmental damage it 
is alleged to have done to the Amazon during the period it produced oil 
there. 

 Texaco has told the court that the Ecuadorean government does not believe 
that it damaged the environment. The judge has asked the Ecuadorean 
government whether this is so: it has yet to reply, but if it supports 
Texaco, the judge says that he would be minded to throw out the case. 

 Last year Texaco promised the government that it would clean up the Amazon 
areas in which it had been operating. The Frente (and other independent 
organisations such as Greenpeace) say that the work Texaco has promised to 
do will not make-up for the environmental damage it has wrought.  

 The Frente initially sought US Dollars 1.5bn in damages, but it has now 
dropped this to US Dollars 800m. 

 Bolivia: Hydrocarbon production increased by 12% in the first quarter to 
30,131bpd, according to the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica. The INE said 
that the country's total production in 1995 was 2.43m barrels (which was 
enough to meet domestic demand). This year it is forecasting that production 
will increase to 2.74m barrels.

 The INE also noted that production from fields operated by the state oil 
company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos, fell by 9% to an 
average of 18,570bpd. The Vibora field in the north of the country is the 
YPFB's most productive field, producing 5,321bpd. 

 The good news is that private contractors increased their output by 77% in 
the first quarter to 11,561bpd. The biggest oilfield in the country, Surubi, 
which is operated by Maxus, a subsidiary of Argentina's YPF. This field 
produced 9,335bpd.   

 Venezuela: Congress has approved the contracts won by the successful 
bidders in the January auction for deep fields of light and medium crudes. 
The winning groups (LAEB 03 96 p24) had paid US Dollars 245m in bonds at the 
time of the auction. The contracts, which will be on a joint-venture basis, 
signal the end of 20 years of state control of the oil industry. The new 
fields are reckoned to hold 17bn barrels of crude. 
  The Ministerio de Energia y Minas said that the average price for its oil 
exports was US Dollars 16.7 a barrel in the first five months of the year. 
The average price in the first half of June was down to US Dollars 16.3 a 
barrel. Officials expects quite a sharp decline (to an average of US Dollars 
14 a barrel) over the next three months as the embargo on Iraqi exports 
ends. 

 Paraguay: A US oil company, Phillips Petroleum, has ended its search for 
oil in the country. It drilled two dry holes and spent US Dollars 15m. Over 
the last 50 years fifty oil wells have been drilled in the country without 
finding significant amounts of oil.

 REGION: COPPER: PRICE PROBLEMS: TURMOIL ON THE LME

 The wild gyrations of the copper price on the London Metal Exchange are 
likely to have major effects on Latin America's two biggest copper 
producers, Chile and Peru. Over the past month the price of copper has 
dropped from US Dollars 2,800 a tonne (US Dollars 1.27 a pound) to US 
Dollars 1,900 a tonne (or US Dollars 0.86 a pound) before recovering to US 
Dollars 2,300 a tonne (or US Dollars 1.04 a pound). 

 We have been bears of copper for the past 18 months, though we did not 
expect the collapse in the market to be so sudden. We had expected a gentle 
glide down from last year's peaks to around US Dollars 1.10 a pound by the 
end of the year. 

 No-one seems entirely sure why the copper market has tumbled so far so 
fast. The two main reasons advanced by traders and analysts are (1) that 
China has held off from the market and (2) that Sumitomo Corporation from 
Japan, a major copper holder, might be about to change its policy.

 China is both a major producer and consumer of copper. Traders had been 
expecting it to start buying copper in order to meet the demand caused by 
its fast economic growth rate and heavy investment in infrastructure. Some 
analysts also expect it to want to build up its stocks of both refined 
copper and concentrates so that it has sufficient stocks to see it through 
any problems following the (long-anticipated) death of Deng Xiaoping. So far 
this buying has not come through, so analysts are beginning to wonder if 
China now reckons that it has sufficient reserves of copper.

 In the first half of June the copper market was riddled with rumours that 
Sumitomo's chief copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, had either resigned or been 
sacked. Finally. Sumitomo made an announcement on 13 June in which the 
company revealed that Hamanaka had been responsible for US Dollars 1.8bn 
worth of unauthorised trading over the past decade. The big fear in the 
copper market is that Sumitomo, which had a reputation for building up 
stocks which it then used to squeeze traders who were short of copper might 
now be holding more of the metal than it needs. This could mean that it 
would become a seller of copper, driving prices down further. 

 This fear drove the copper price down to US Dollars 1,850 a tonne on the 
day that Hamanaka's unauthorised trading was revealed. Although the price 
recovered to close at just over US Dollars 2,000 a tonne, we would expect 
the price to remain weak.

 So. What is clear from the tables and charts on this page is that weaker 
copper prices pose a big threat to both Chile's and Peru's prospects for a 
trade surplus this year. If copper prices were to average US Dollars 0.90 
for the year, Chile's copper revenues would fall by a quarter, even assuming 
a 10% rise in export volumes. The same would happen in Peru's case, though 
the consequences could be more dramatic since the trade account is already a 
problem. 

 In 1995, copper provided 21% of Peru's export revenues, and 41% of Chile's. 

 So far comment from both Chile and Peru on the prospects for the copper 
market have been muted; Juan Villarzu, president of the state-owned 
Corporacion del Cobre, the world's biggest copper producer, has said that 
the London Metal Exchange, the world's main copper market, must do more to 
ensure a more stable market.

 Eduardo Aninat, the Chilean finance minister, has said that the budget 
could be affected by the fall in copper prices. Last year Codelco alone 
provided the government with US Dollars 1.3bn: this was more than the rest 
of the corporate sector put together provided. Chile's total tax revenues in 
1995 were US Dollars 10bn.

 PERU: LOOKING FOR A BOOM: AS NEW INVESTMENT FLOODS IN

 The Peruvian mining industry expects to be exporting US Dollars 4bn worth 
of metals by 2005. In 1995, the industry exported metals worth US Dollars 
2.6bn.

 The president of the Sociedad Nacional de Mineria y Petroleo, Walter 
Sologuren, said that the growth of the industry would be led by new 
discoveries, privatisation and the renewed interest multinational mining 
companies were now showing in the industry. He said that this made a change: 
he claimed that the country had been spurned by investors since 1970.

 Sologuren said that he expected total investment in the mining industry to 
be US Dollars 13bn between 1995 and 2005. Of that, he expected foreign 
mining companies to stump up 60%.   

 Sologuren said that the country would be producing around 2m t of refined 
metals by the year 2004. He claimed that the biggest increase would probably 
come in gold production. He expected that Peru would be the biggest gold 
producer in Latin America by the end of the century, producing around 100t. 
In 1995 the country produced 56t which produced export revenues of US 
Dollars 460m. 

 Copper. Copper production has increased, especially at Toquepala, Cuajone, 
Cerro Verde and Tintaya. The big boost has come at Cerro Verde and Tintaya, 
which were privatised. In 1995, copper exports were US Dollars 1.2bn, up 
from US Dollars 824m in 1994. 

 The total revenues from mining exports were US Dollars 2.60bn in 1995, up 
from US Dollars 1.96bn in 1994.

 Gold. The fastest growing export, though, was gold. Export revenues 
increased by 37% as export volumes rose by 35%. Peruvian goldminers talk 
optimistically about the world developing a shortage of gold. Jaime Uranga, 
president of the Comite Aurifero de la Sociedad Nacional de Mineria y 
Petroleo, said that the world's current gold production of about 2,268t a 
year was about 1,000t short of demand, which he estimated to be 3,550t. So 
far, he said, the shortfall had been covered by loans or sales from stocks 
held either by central banks or investors.

 The whole question of gold supply and demand is complicated by the fact 
that one source of demand is from mining companies which borrow gold to 
develop new gold mines. They pay back the loans with their new production. 
Frequently the goldmines also hedge their production forward to lock in 
prices when they believe that prices might fall. 

 The core of the demand argument which suggests that prices are unlikely to 
fall is that production from the world's largest gold producer, South 
Africa, is falling at an annual rate of between 15% and 20%. South Africa's 
deep mines are some of the most expensive to operate in the world.

 Peru's main goldmine is Yanacocha which is owned by the big US mining 
company, Newmont. Yanacocha recently discovered another gold deposit, Sipan, 
which holds 16.8m t of ore with an average gold content of 1.73g per t and 
an average silver content of 4.1g per tonne. This mine is likely to come on 
stream in 1998. 

 Yanacocha is scheduled to produce 620,000 ounces (19.2t) this year, up from 
552,000 ounces in 1995. 

 Silver: Peru's export revenues rose by 13% even though the international 
price of silver fell by 13%. 

 New law: The government has promulgated a new law which tidies up some of 
the outstanding questions of ownership rights. The new law, which has been 
approved by congress, cleans up the register of claims, throwing out 11,000 
claims and forcing another 9,000 to lapse. The new law also stipulates that 
the coordinates of new (and all existing) concessions must be surveyed and 
marked on a single geographical map.

 SURINAME: BAUXITE: DEMAND: BY UNION

 The Paranam Workers' Union has pulled back from a confrontation with the 
management at Suralco. The union had issued an ultimatum, which expired on 9 
June, demanding a salary increase of 185%.

 The management had offered 30%, saying it could not afford higher 
increases. 

 The union points out that the official figure for inflation was 238% in 
1995, so even a 185% rise would represent a fall in real wages. 

 Despite the rejection of its ultimatum the union has resumed talks with the 
management. The union says that it will not do anything to damage the 
company, though it points out that the company's income is US Dollars 140 
per day per worker, yet the average daily wage is only US Dollars 4. 

 Gold: Uruguay's first gold mine is scheduled to come into production in 
1998. Owned and operated by the American Resource Corporation, the Mina San 
Gregorio will cost about US Dollars 50m to develop. It reckons to produce 
75,000 ounces (2.3t) of gold a year from processing 1m t of ore. The mine is 
based in the north of the country at Minas de Corrales, close to the border 
with Brazil. American Resource made its first venture into Uruguay in 1993 
when it extracted US Dollars 8m worth of gold from a mine that was thought 
to be exhausted at San Jose, 90km from Montevideo.

 Copper: Chile's Codelco and the Australian Mutual Provident Society have 
revealed more about their joint venture, Los Andes. In the initial stages 
the company will concentrate on developing Maria Delia, Sierra Jardin, 
Exploradora and Sierra de Moreno. These are all copper mines. Codelco will 
provide US Dollars 12m while AMP will supply US Dollars 6m. Los Andes' 
president will be Edgardo Boeninger, a former minister and senior official 
at the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.

 CUBA: FOCUS ON CUBA'S BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY: TRYING TO BOOST EXPORTS

 Cuba has been trying to build up its biotechnology industry for at least 
the past two decades. It has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in 
government-run research institutes such as the Centro de Ingenieria Genetica 
y Biotecnologia, the most famous of the 30 or so biotech institutes in Cuba. 

 The government has long nursed ambitions of becoming a major exporter of 
biotechnology. Indeed, before the collapse of Comecon in 1989, Cuba claimed 
to be exporting US Dollars 500m worth of medicines a year. This figure has 
since dwindled, along with exports of other Cuban products, to US Dollars 
100m.

 Cuba's most successful products are anti-meningitis and hepatitis vaccines 
and some diagnostic kits. Last year the country recently used its own anti-
leprosy vaccine to fight an outbreak of that disease in Holguin, it 
inoculated 120,000 people against the disease. The country also has high 
hopes of a product that deals with Tresteza, a disease that can wipe out 
citrus crops.

 Generally, however, the performance of Cuban products in export markets has 
been disappointing.

 Cuba claims to have 5,000 scientists and technicians working in its 
mediacal research industry. The quality of the scientists must be open to 
question: Jamaica recently ended its agreement to recognise Cuban medical 
qualifications after some poor experiences with Cuban trained doctors. 

 The most success the Cubans had was in selling biotech goods to other Latin 
American countries. Brazil and Colombia especially had been (reasonably) 
enthusiastic buyers of Cuban made medicines. Last year Colombia signed a US 
Dollars 10m deal to buy Cuban-made hepatitis and antimeningococcal 
meningitis Group B vaccine. Other Latin American countries have also bought 
a cholesterol-reducing drug PPG. 

 Cuba had also managed to sell interferons (which are used for a variety of 
tasks from diagnosing pregnancy to dealing with AIDS infections) to China.  

 York deal. The government has now changed tack and started to use 
established companies to break into new markets. It recently signed a deal 
with a Canadian firm, York Medical, to develop and sell Cuban biotech 
products in Canada and Europe. 

 The government awarded York a licence to test and market human and 
veterinary pharmaceuticals made by the biotech industry. Under this deal, 
York Medical will transfer technology and test products in Canadian biotech 
facilities. Cubans will also be trained to develop and market products. 

 York says that it will not only market Cuban biotech products in developed 
markets, such as Canada and Europe, but it will also assist in financing new 
products and getting them through the regulatory and quality controls which 
keep them from new markets. 

 Immediate plans. For the moment, York will concentrate on marketing 15 
Cuban biotech products (such as Heberquinasa (which eliminates blood clots); 
an epidermal growth factor which detects tumours; the antibiotics testing 
system; Diramic; Udertan (a product generated from red mangroves to 
disinfect cow udders); and Dermofural (an antibacterial and anti-fungal 
cream made from sugar cane extract.

 Neither York nor the Cubans expect any trouble from the Helms-Burton Act. 
They say that no US assets are used by the biotech industry and the 
intellectual property on which the industry is based dates from the early 
1980s, well after the 1959 revolution. 

 Non-human strengths. The strongest parts of the Cuban biotech industry 
appear to be in products that do not have medical applications. At a 
conference last year attended by 250 US, European and Latin American 
scientists, there was considerable interest in a vaccine that protects 
cattle against ticks, genetically engineered crops that repel insects and 
industrial enzymes. One of these enzymes dissolves dextran, a gummy 
substance that bogs down the sugar refining process. Cuban sugar producers 
say that the use of the enzyme has cut the sugar mills' energy consumption 
by nearly half.

 Maquila. One idea that has been canvassed by international drug producers 
is to use Cuba as a cheap manufacturing base. This will only happen if the 
country improves its regulatory and control standards: drug companies have 
been scared by what happened to Fisons, a British drug company which is now 
part of the Rorer Group which failed to meet US Food and Drug Administration 
standards at an inspection. The company was forced to stop production until 
it improved its systems. 

 Cuban scientists would certainly like access to hard currencies: at present 
most of them earn less than taxi drivers and barmen. The CIGB is trying to 
improve the scientists' lot by paying some of their salaries in dollars.
