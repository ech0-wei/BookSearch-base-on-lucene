During the process, one individual tries to form an understanding (opinion or belief) about another. In some cases, itis possible to provide questionnaires or present tasks which provide a sample of behavior that will assist the assessor in forming his oppinion. Standardized tests may be used to attempt to measure the relative prevalence of skills and abilities, target behaviors, reported feelings and beliefs, etc. <H2>Hard Area Tests</H2><P>Tests which measure <EM>skills and abilities</EM> are variouslycalled aptitude tests, achievement tests, diagnostic tests, IQtests, etc. These may be classed as within the &quot;hard&quot;area of measurement. It is possible for an examinee to adopt aresponding strategy on these tests so as to &quot;fake bad&quot;and cause a lower score on these tests than honest effort wouldobtain. However, it is not possible to &quot;fake good&quot; andget a higher score than honest effort would produce.<H2>Soft Area Tests</H2><P>Tests which ask questions about an individual's past behaviors, beliefs or feelingsare classed as operating in the &quot;soft&quot; area of measurement.These are called personality tests, interest inventories, honestyand reliability tests, etc. Since these tests are mostly self-reportsof thoughts, beliefs and feelings, or past behavior, there are no <EM>right or wrong</EM>responses -- only honest and dishonest ones. It is possible for examinees to design their responsesto such tests in order to present themselves in a favorable light (called faking good), to answer honestly, to present themselves in an unfavorable light (called faking bad, or even to respond completely randomly. It is also possible forexaminees to respond differently from one day to another (dependingon other outside factors) in a manner which may still technicallybe considered honest.From the foregoing, one can see that the examiner is faced withthe task of assessing the client's responding strategy before(s)he even begins to assess what a soft area test suggests aboutthe examinee. Many such tests include &quot;lie&quot; scales thatattempt to identify examinees whose responding strategy isgrossly dishonest. However, even the best of these tests cannot control very well for some individuals' natural tendency toward &quot;openness&quot;and &quot;frankness&quot; and the tendency of others to be morecircumspect.<P><H3>Does this Mean Soft Area Tests are Useless?</H3><P><B>No!</B> Soft area tests may be <EM>very</EM> useful for counsellorswho have the cooperation of their clients. <EM>Vocational couselling</EM>has been facilitated to a great extent by a group of tests called <EM>interestinventories</EM>. Though for pre-employment testing these inventoriesare essentially useless. Soft area tests also may be of help toexperienced psychologists who can make some sense of the client'sresponding strategy. The great danger of all soft area testsis that beginners (or those from other disciplines -- i.e. lawyers)often want to read more into a test result than is there. Mostwell designed and researched soft area scales comprised of twenty or more unique items are capable of ranking an individual as Low,Normal, or High in terms of a target characteristic. Attemptingto read more than this into a test score is usually not supportable. Whilethe experienced professional knows that the difference of a coupleof score points either way should signify nothing on soft areatests -- the problem exists that at some specific point it isconsidered necessary to begin calling a score high, or low.  This fact alone frustrates computer analysis of test scores, because computers require an algorithm that includes a very specific point at which a score is to be considered high.<P>The best solution is to retain the services of an experiencedprofessional psychologist if you require the type of informationthat is provided by soft area tests -- although this may not berequired in cases of vocational counselling.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle><P>Copyright &#169 1996,<A HREF="frontpge.htm"> M.D. Angus & Associates Ltd.</A><P><A HREF="mailto:mdangus@psychtest.com">mdangus@psychtest.com</A><P><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<H1>Uses of Pre-employment Tests in Selection Procedures</H1><P>
<AU>by Bill Angus</AU></CENTER><P>
Information in making hiring decisions is generally regarded to come from three sources...<P>
<OL>
<LI>Employment History and Resume</LI>
<LI>Standardized tests, </LI>
<LI>Interviewer impressions.</LI>
</OL>
Of these three sources, Interview has traditionally been the measure most relied on in making hiring decisions. Research suggests that this is entirely the wrong approach, as interview impressions are probably the least likely predictors of job success of the three sources of information listed above.<P>

History is the best indicator we have. Experience shows that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. However an "honest" history can be difficult to obtain. If an employee was well liked or considered a personal friend by a previous employer, even though his/her previous employer was never highly satisfied with the quality of work produced and effort on the job, you could receive a glowing recommendation. Of course, if the employee was well-liked at previous places of employment, it may be that you will come to like this employee as well. The lesson to take from the information presented in this paragraph is: always check the history and references provided on the resume, verify somehow that the person you have been given as a reference is in fact someone who supervises employees, and question any gaps in the chronology of employment provided by the candidate. With regard to chronology, it could be that a previous employment where the individual got into trouble was omitted from the history, or it could be that the individual is someone who becomes periodically unable to work due to physical or mental health problems.<P>

Tests of maximum performance are used to identify the abilities of a prospective employee. Test results should be used to debunk the information obtained about employment history. Note that candidates can "fake bad" on these tests, but unless they have seen the test before, they cannot give a false-positive evaluation. This is not to say that aptitude tests are perfect measures of job performance.  These tests do nothing to measure important personality characteristics such as honestly, reliability, job involvement, customer service orientation, team spirit, etc.  Further they do a less than perfect job of measuring the elusive variable known as common sense which is important in the workplace. Our best estimates suggest that test results by themselves probably account for about 25% of the variance in job performance (Sternberg, American Psychologist vol 50 #11, Nov. 1995).<P>

What we hope to find in examining all three sources of information about an individual is convergence. For if three sources of information seem to indicate roughly the same things about an individual, then the probability that the "things" are correct increases. By contrast, divergence (where one source seems to contradict another) presents a problem that must be dealt with by the personnel manager. Further investigation will hopefully uncover a possible explanation for the contradictory information.<P>

Pre-employment tests should allow an individual to demonstrate a measurable amount of success and a measurable amount of failure on the task provided. I.E. if an individual gets most of the test items correct, it may be that the test is too "easy" to rate the individual accurately. The individual may even have more ability than the test results indicate. Test results are usually reported in terms of percentile ranks and/or standard scores. For those not trained in testing, I suggest sticking to percentile rank interpretation. A candidate scoring at the 90th %段le can be expected to score better than 89% of the reference group which the standardization sample represents and worse than 9% of the reference group. It is not true that getting 90 percent of the test items correct necessarily means that the individual scores at the 90th %段le. %段le scores are derived from a table in the test manual. If you are unsure of how to use %段le scores, get a good organizational psychologist or personnel manager to help you set a cutting score for each of the tests you want to use. Usually you can identify a score for each test below which an individual should not be hired, a range of scores where you might hire the individual if you were under time pressure to fill the position, and a score above which you would like your candidates to score. Do not assume that the highest test scores necessarily indicate the best prospective employee. This would be incorrect, as one can deduce from the preceding discussion above in which it is noted that probably only 25% of the variance in the ability of prospective employees is accounted for by pre-employment tests. Note: never average test results from different tests together. %段le ranks are not equal interval scores. For example there are many more people who fall between the 50th and 55th %段le than fall between the 90th and 95th %段le. <P>

Although we have dealt only with tests of maximum performance so far, a word needs to be said about "personality tests" and "honesty and reliability tests". I believe that personality assessments should be performed using respected objective tests and should generally be done by (or under the supervision of) an experienced industrial psychologist. This is not to insult personnel managers (or inexperienced psychologists), but rather to say that personality tests generally require interpretation. The ability to provide this interpretation is a skill which is developed after a good deal of experience. Personality tests generally lend themselves to manipulation by examinees much more than do tests of maximum performance. Even though the best of these tests have scales that attempt to detect dissimulation on the part of examinees, they are necessarily less reliable than tests of maximum performance. They are said to operate in a "softer" area and users should be advised that such tests can provide both false-positive and false-negative scores.<P>

Despite the problems with personality assessment, some tests have been devised specifically for use by personnel managers in measuring some aspects of employee reliability. These tests tend to be quite expensive (in the order of $30.00 per examinee). Test developers have justified the price of these tests based on development costs and potential savings arising from not hiring employees who steal, who are unreliable, or even those who are likely to take stress leave or abuse the company benefits plan. Human resources managers should always remember that the administration of one or more personality test tests is not the same thing as a comprehensive personality assessment provided by an organizational psychologist. A comprehensive pre-employment assessment by an industrial psychologist should include ability and personality measures, plus an extensive interview.  These assessments typically cost in the neighborhood of $500 - $1,000 per candidate, and should be based on an hourly rate charged by the psychologist. The professional psychologists association in your region will usually have a published recommended rate schedule for their members which may be used to verify that quoted charges for candidate assessments are within reason.  Bear in mind that Psychologists with training in industrial/organizational work should be entitled to charge slightly more than the minimum recommended rates, due to the demand for their specialization.<P>

<H2><CENTER>Achievement Tests, Diagnostic (Achievement) Tests,
Aptitude Tests, Tests of Intelligence/Cognitive Functioning and
the Use of These Various Categories of Tests With Non-Handicapped ESL Populations </CENTER></H2>

<P>
<CENTER><AUTHOR>by W.A. (Bill) Angus, Test Consultant</AUTHOR></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="bar2.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
Recent requests for information from test consultants indicates
that school psychologists are perceiving a belief among teachers,
administrators, and/or parents that it is not <EM>valid</EM> or
supportable to use English language achievement tests or tests
of cognitive functioning (IQ) in making educational decisions
about ESL students. Some confusion over the definition of achievement
tests and the objectives of such tests is evident in these conversations.
A distinction should be made between achievement tests and ability
(IQ) tests. A distinction also needs to be made between those
who have not learned because they have not been offered instruction
and those who have a handicap which requires that instruction
take the form of devising work-arounds for their handicap. Students
for whom English is a Second Language (ESL students) and others
whose learning ability is not handicapped in some way are the
subject of this paper.<P>
<H1>Sullivan's Legacy for Learners</H1>

<P>
It is important to consider the innapropriateness of using student age as a determinant of what instruction a the student should receive in school. All too often in our schools, students' chronological age is used to decide what materials should be presented for instruction. In the late 1980's a numerous series of reports by the British
Columbia's Ministry of Education and by the Royal Commission on
Education (Sullivan, Barry M., 1987-88 Legacy for Learners and
other publications) on the requirements for education in British
Columbia for the <EM>Year 2000</EM> and beyond were produced.
Though Sullivan was a learned man possessed of an acute legal
mind, he was not an experienced teacher of young children. He made the very good point that
students should be schooled with their same age-peers for reasons
of socialization and self-esteem. Unfortunately, much of his work was coloured
by his personal belief that achievement is a personal thing no
matter what level of basic skills one possesses. Sullivan challenged
the traditional ideas that <EM>passing</EM> or <EM>grades</EM> were important,
and questioned educational assessment that would in any way compare
a student with his/her peers. In BC, the Ministry of Education
produced documents too numerous to cite that attempted to provide
implementation details and policy information based on Sullivan's
reports. Sadly, Barry Sullivan was terminally ill at the time
he was finishing his work on the report which he entitled the
Legacy for Learners. He did not live to see the legacy of the
policies which resulted. If he had, it is possible that he might have revised
some of his opinion.
<P>
In 1996, nearly a decade after the Legacy to Learners, students
have been routinely promoted into classes where they will receive instruction
and independent assignments which merely frustrate them because
the work is far too difficult for them to understand. This is not to be blamed entirely on Sullivan's reports, as promotion decisions which were changed in response to the Year 2000 document only made a minor contribution in this area. I argue this because of a personal observation that the school system as a whole was already doing very little to insure that instruction and materials of an appropriate level of difficulty were being offered to all students. It is true that after Sullivan's report, promotion to the next level of schooling (grade?) became almost automatic. The 
good idea of keeping students with age-peers was implemented. But insufficient means of insuring that teachers are provided with the resources needed to make diverse and appropriate
lesson plans for every individual in their class has been provided. Today we can see that as class load increased
and external resources were reduced, the regular classroom teacher
was in fact given progressively less time and resources with which to prepare
and correct individual assignments.
<P>
It is an interesting aside that research in the U.S. has shown
that bright students face a problem similar to that of slow students
in the regular classroom. When class instruction and assignments
are well below their independent learning level, these students
will experience a great deal of boredom and drop out in far greater
numbers than their age-peers who have lesser ability! The problem of bright students
receiving instructional material that is too easy, is even less likely to be resolved than the reverse problem that slow students face. Because even under more traditional views of education, a teacher
who could get all of his students to <EM>pass</EM> was considered
to be a <EM>wonderful teacher</EM>. This notwithstanding the fact
that for the brightest students, merely being able to pass may
in fact mean that they have received unchallenging instruction
throughout the whole year.
<P>
The above discussion was intended to deal only with the need to select appropriate educational materials and provide instruction to meet the needs of each student. The topic was broached in attempt to justify the need for good tests to help accomplish this goal. The writer may have seemed unfair in singling out the recommendations of B.C.'s Sullivan Commission for comment. The education system all accross North America has been fairly criticized by parents for failing to provide adequate instruction in the 3 R subjects (reading writing and arithmetic) for more than fifty years. To deal with whether or not the education system merits criticism, or even with the weaknesses of the Sullivan Commission Reports would be topics for a much longer article than this one is intended to be.
However, if one accepts Sullivan's contention that schools
shouldn't use standardized assessments which compare one student's
performance to that of his/her age-peers,
then read no further. This paper is not for you. The writer has
a reasonably thorough understanding of standardized achievement and ability tests and
believes that they provide useful information.
<P>
Standardized tests represent a technological advantage. They are very similar in effect to other technology -- for example the wheel and the lever -- in that a properly applied standardized test is a labour saving
device. A very experienced and unbiased teacher will eventually get
much of the same information as is provided by tests, simply
through working with a student individually over time. Tests merely provide
educational information quickly and in an objective way.<P>

<H2>Achievement Tests and Their Use With Non-handicapped Students</H2>
<P>
Achievement tests are designed to identify the level of academic/school
skills that a student possesses. It is therefore entirely appropriate
to use English language achievement tests when assessing the academic
skills of any student who is enrolled in an English language program
of instruction -- provided the test objectives match the materials
the individual will have been exposed to in the curriculum reasonably
closely. This is true whether or not the individual is a native
English speaker. By definition, achievement tests are <EM>those
tests which identify the appropriate instructional level at which
to begin teaching the student.</EM>
<P>
A teacher who knows how to use standardized tests can use scores
on an achievement test to identify Independent Learning level,
Instructional learning level and Frustration level. This allows
the teacher to...
<OL>
<LI>select appropriate material for the student's use in independent
learning
<LI>select slightly more difficult materials which will be suitable
for use in instructing the student
<LI>screen out more difficult material which would be frustrating
to the student because the pre-requisite skills and concepts for
understanding instruction have not yet been acquired 
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Diagnostic Achievement Tests: A Subset of Achievement Tests
</H3>
<P>
Diagnostic achievement tests are designed for use with individuals
thought to be weak in basic skills. By basic skills, we mean those
school skills which were taught in previous grades and which are
now required as enabling skills to allow instruction at the individual's
present grade level. For example, if a student cannot read adequately,
then he/she may not be able to take regular class instruction
where the reading requirements are beyond his/her level of achievement.
Diagnostic tests are achievement tests designed to be used with
those who are behind their peers in terms of basic academic skills
(usually reading and math). It is certainly appropriate to use
English language diagnostic tests with ESL students. However,
one should always bear in mind that the distinction between a
regular achievement test and a diagnostic achievement test is
often very subtle. For most purposes, there would be no sense
in making a distinction, except that diagnostic tests sometimes
include items one would not bother using with regular classroom
students. The Stanford Diagnostic Series (SDRT-4th edition, 1996)
for example tests knowledge of graphemes &amp; phonemes plus literal
and inferential reading comprehension. For students who are not
having problems with reading it would be sufficient to identify
an overall level of reading comprehension in order to find an
appropriate instructional or independent learning level. That
is, one would expect to be able to measure reading as a <EM>whole
skill</EM> possibly using a test like Jerry Johns' Basic Reading Inventory (BRI - 6th ed., 1995), or the group administered  Degrees of Reading Power (DRP, 1994).<P>
<H3>Achievement Tests &amp; ESL Populations</H3>
<P>
It is worth mentioning that teachers should not expect the achievement
test results of ESL students to indicate uniform grade placement
in all subject areas. As is found with Adult Basic Education (ABE)
students, ESL students can be expected to have scores in reading
and language subjects which may be several grades behind their
math and science/practical achievement scores. With ABE students
reading at a grade five level, we often find math achievement to be
near the grade eight level. For adults reading at the high school level however, this reading math difference disappears. The Canadian Adult Achievement Test
(CAAT, 1988) and its parent the U.S. Adult Basic Learning Examination
Battery include math items which would be at a higher grade level than the reading and language items -- if the test were to be presented to normal school-age students.
Since there is no reason to assume that we must give a reading
test which is printed in the same booklet as the math tests we
wish to use, it can be argued that any achievement battery can
be used with ESL or ABE students. Except for the fact that it
is nice to use items that employ age-appropriate language and subject matter,
the achievement tests we have available to us are quite adequate for use with
ESL students.<BR>

</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>
Teachers should be aware that it may be necessary to use an achievement
battery with separate math and reading booklets (or to use a wide
range test) when testing ESL students. It is possible to conceive
of a regular school achievement test booklet that could have a
math test which is too simple for the student and reading and
language tests which are too difficult. This would suggest that
the best achievement tests for use with ESL students might be
good quality, individually administered, wide range tests like
the Woodcock-Johnson Achievement Test - Form A (WJ-R, 1989) and
Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT, 1992).
<P>
If one requires group administerable tests, there are several
batteries which have separate Math and Reading booklets like SDRT
&amp; SDMT (4th ed., 1995) that easily allow administration of
a reading test from one level along with a math test from a higher
level. One should plan for the probability that a 15 year old
ESL students can be expected to achieve faster than a 10 year
old native English speaker receiving the same curriculum. This
is because the ESL student should have some transferable skills
and abilities that the native English student does not have. That
is, do not expect a 15 year old ESL student to take the same amount
of time to traverse the grade 6 curriculum that a native English
speaking grade 6 student will take. Re-assess the ESL student
frequently to determine if more advanced materials can be presented
more quickly in the sequence of instruction. 
<H2>Tests of Cognitive Functioning (IQ Tests)
</H2>

<P>
Ability tests are variously known as IQ tests, tests of cognitive
ability, intelligence tests, tests of cognitive processes, aptitude
tests, etc., etc. The goal of these tests is to provide a number
which will be relatively constant over the individual's lifetime
(regardless of instruction) that represents how <EM>able to learn</EM>
an individual is. These tests generally present tasks which may
be described as being like <EM>puzzles</EM>, or questions about
<EM>general knowledge</EM>. The tests can be verbal (requiring
the use of language) or non-verbal (requiring almost zero language
skills -- the individual may even be able to point to or circle
a correct response). Non-verbal tests cannot really sample general
knowledge, and hence do not provide information about this area
of functioning. Luckily, most aptitude scores and most subtests
of IQ tests are highly intercorrelated (usually at approximately
+0.8). This means that we can to a limited extent (accounting
for about 60% of the common variance) generalize from an individual's
ability as measured by non-verbal IQ tests, to predict what his/her
ability on other types of IQ tests -- like a verbal ability test written in the student's own language. Until recently, most non-verbal tests (i.e.
Ravens Matrices and TONI-2) have been brief unidimensional wide
range tests which consisted of a small set of steeply graded items.
These tests were characterized by relatively few items at each
level of difficulty. More recently a new test, the Comprehensive
test of Nonverbal Intelligence (CTONI, Don Hammill, 1995) has
been released which consists of six sets of steeply graded items.
Admin. time for all 6 subtests is 1 hour. Though this test is
a wide range test and hence has many of the same problems as the
more unidimensional wide range tests, at least it presents a more multidimensional picture of non-verbal IQ.
<P>
The problem with using English language IQ tests with people from
different cultures, is that they may not fairly represent the
individual's <EM>ability to learn</EM>. This is especially true
of <EM>general knowledge</EM> types of items -- though the criticism
has been extended to even non-verbal items. The critics state
that in some cultures, the individual is only seldom exposed to
paper and pencil types of tasks. Thus, say the critics, rather
than measuring enabling skills our IQ tests are measuring achievement.
Even the mere ability to sit and take a test may represent an
achievement that the individual may have just learned. This argument
becomes a bit like the nature-nurture question in psychology in
that it is best left to academics and ascetics to argue. For a
good criticism of IQ tests see for example just about anything
the very prolific Robert Sternberg has written over the last 15
years. A whole issue of the American Psychologist was recently
devoted to a good general discussion of IQ tests including a section
by Sternberg (vol. 51, No.2, Feb, 1996). For practical information
on how to use these tests any one of a number of general texts
will suffice. E.G. <EM>Assessment of Children</EM> (Jerome Sattler,
1992), <EM>WISC-3 Companion</EM> (Truch, 1993). For general information
on <EM>Fairness in Testing</EM> see the American Psychologist,
November 1994 (vol.49, no.11) although this article focuses somewhat on fairness issues in vocational testing.
<P>
Contrary to one's impression from reading Sternberg's prolific
writings, what is most surprising to beginning practitioners is
that the authors of IQ tests have been able to accomplish their
task moderately well. Results of IQ tests do seem to be reasonably
constant and stable over time. It is amazing to some people (especially
parents) that individuals with low IQ can often be given a great
deal of high quality, expensive/intensive instruction and still
end up having IQ scores that are similar to the score they had
before the instruction. However, this is precisely how the tests
are supposed to work, so it is really not all that surprising.
<P>
The notion that ability scores stay reasonably stable over time meets with some resistance from certain teachers, who rightly contend that all children are capable of increasing their knowledge of basic skills. Children advance over time. However as one individual achieves greater proficiency, so too have his/her peers increased their knowledge. The result is that relative to same-age peers, an individual's ranking tends to remain relatively constant on IQ tests. 
Teaching the tasks on IQ tests would not help. A wise school psychologist once told me that we could give students
classes in block design (block design is one of the WISC-3 subtests),
but that wouldn't really be increasing their intelligence. All
we would actually accomplish would be to destroy the validity
of the blocks subtest of Wechsler's scales for use as an indicator
of the intelligence of students.
<H2>Use of Achievement &amp; IQ Tests in Combination </H2>
<P>
Achievement and ability tests should be used together. The proper
use of IQ tests for educators teaching students who don't have
a neurologically based problem, is in obtaining
achievement vs. ability comparisons. If a biologically normal
individual has an IQ of 115 and obtains achievement scores at
the 45th %'ile, then it is probable that the individual can immediately
benefit from having a teacher or school psychologist provide an
individualized educational plan (IEP) and may benefit from seeing
the school counselor to find out if something in his/her home life is interfering with
learning. If the individual has an IQ that is
one standard deviation above the mean, then, through instruction,
theory suggests that achievement test scores should be able to approach one standard
deviation above the mean. I use this example with tongue in cheek
since, with scores so near the mean, this individual is unlikely to
qualify for the services of a learning assistance teacher (nor
probably for the services of the school counselor) -- though they may receive help if they exhibit a behavior problem.
<P>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
What benefits do standardized tests offer regular classroom teachers and/or learning assistance teachers of ESL students? Basically
by the definition of achievement tests, it is supportable to use
English language achievement tests to place ESL students within
provincial or state reading or math curricula. These tests are a labour-saving device that helps identify the best point in the curiculum to begin teaching. Some (diagnostic) achievement tests also provide information about strengths and weaknesses in terms of basic skills being taught in the curriculum. 
Diagnostic achievement tests should be used with those who seem to
be having difficulty acquiring basic reading or math -- for without
the enabling skills, higher academic learning is not possible.
We may conclude that one should be very careful using
IQ tests with ESL students. That is, use the tests, but be aware
that they may not represent the ceiling of what an individual
is capable of learning quite as much as they do with native English
speakers.

For evaluating the test itself, you will need to buy a copy. Test publishers as a group have decided not to offer free copies for evaulation purposes. Moreover, you are expected to treat the evaluation copy you purchase in accordance with the <A HREF="Policies.html">proper procedures for handling tests</A>, even though you are asked to pay for the evaluation copy. People who are new to testing sometimes have a problem with the expected standard of behavior for test users. However, if you view these <A HREF="WhatAreR.html">standards</A> from the perspective of the test publisher and the other users of these tests, they will come to make sense.<P>Most test publishers allow for the purchase of a single copy of a test and/or manual for evaluation. That is, normally you do not have to buy 25 copies of a test just to look it over. Whenever you see an item entitled <EM>examination kit</EM> or <EM>specimen set</EM> it will usually contain a sample copy of the printed test forms and a manual (though usually not a scoring key). Sometimes it will be possible to purchase a test manual (which may have a copy of the test reproduced in an appendix). This at least will allow you to determine if you want to go to the expense of purchasing a kit which provides all the materials necessary for several administrations. Specimen sets are sold for evaluation purposes. Once you have received them, <U><EM>you may not</EM></U> return them for a refund.<P>The test publishing industry does not function as a library system. Nor does it support the<EM> gratis</EM> promotional system common in book publishing. Free copies of tests are almost never given to people for promotional  purposes.<P>Most publishers will not reduce the rate at which <A HREF="WhatCopy.html">copyrighted</A> test materials are sold to researchers. If a special edition of a test needs to be printed, such arrangements can only be negotiated directly with the publisher. Typically rights to reproduce tests are not granted at all, or if they are granted require the purchaser to pay all costs of printing up their own copies, plus 60% of the regular edition selling price (as a royalty).<CENTER><IMG SRC="bar1.gif" ALIGN=middle><P>Copyright &#169 1996,<A HREF="frontpge.htm"> M.D. Angus & Associates Ltd.</A><P><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<TITLE>What Is Copyright Law and How Does It Apply to Testing Materials?</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor=white><bgsound src="sound.mid" LOOP=infinite><CENTER><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle><H1>What Is Copyright Law and How Does It Apply to Testing Materials?</H1><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle></CENTER><H2>Overview</H2><P><P>Copyright Law holds that an individual legal entity (the publisher) may own the rights to make and sell copies of an original work (sometimes referred to as an intellectual property). The rights of ownership of the work may be held by the publisher, but are more frequently held by an <EM>author</EM> who assigns his rights to a publisher in exchange for a contracted royalty based on returns from the sale of copies by the publisher. Copyright Law is therefore very important to authors and to members of the publishing industry. This industry includes book publishers, software publishers, test publishers, and many other types of businesses. <P>Users who possess a legitimate copy of a test purchased from a test publisher do not have the right to make copies of the test, or any part thereof, without a contract which assigns the publisher's right to make copies.<H2>What Parts of Tests Are Considered Intellectual Property?</H2><P>Test publishers take a position that all parts of a test -- test booklets and questionnaire forms, answer documents, keys, norms, manual and instructions --  are copyright. This position is quite defensible, in that actual reproductions of a work are fairly blatant violations of the priciples outlined in copyright laws. However, test publishers also contend that the information as to how to score a test (the key and norms) is intellectual property that is covered by copyright law. That is, you may buy a copy of a test manual, but you may not use the information contained therein, except as specified by the test publisher. This contention is only marginally defensible, though case law and out of court settlements seems to favor test publishers. In a sense however, asking people to refrain from using information contained in books that they have purchased (test manuals), in whatever way they  see fit, becomes a bit ridiculous. At a certain point this becomes like asking all grade 1 students who learn to read from a text book to only engage in reading as directed by the publisher of the text book -- for the rest of their lives.<P>Because legal costs are so high, most individuals faced with a legal challenge by a large publishing company have backed down. Most have declared bankruptcy, some others have spent their resources trying to reach a settlement with the publisher. None seem to have taken the more expensive route of trying to establish sensible definitive copyright precedents. Most test users concur that it is best to let the publishers "have it their way". After all, if publishers did not invest in producing the tests, either there would be no easy access to high quality tests, or test publishers would simply refuse to sell copies of their keys and norms. Keys and norms could be kept as a trade secret of the publisher and tests could only be scored by a licensed agent of the publisher.<P>The contention that test publishers make that would seem at first to be the most difficult to substantiate in a court, is the claim that whenever you administer a test to a client, you must use the test forms which they sell -- and that you must purchase these forms for whatever price the publisher wishes to charge -- if you wish to use the test. This charge can range from 1 dollar per page to several dollars per page, even if the page is only a form on which an examinee marks down his responses to test questions. The questions may be on a different form altogether which you also must purchase.<P>The cost imposed on users by publishers seems to be born with good humor. Most people are happy to have some place where they can obtain tests, and realize that if publishers went broke, or if,  as a group, they began to refuse to sell keys and norms, then the whole test user population would be worse off.<P>The writer believes that, on balance, only a few test publishers abuse  copyright law. Traditionally publishing has been an honorable business. Today this tradition shines through, even though tarnished in some places.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle><P>Copyright &#169 1996,<A HREF="frontpge.htm"> M.D. Angus & Associates Ltd.</A><P><IMG SRC="bar2.gif" ALIGN=middle></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<CENTER><H2>DIFFERENTIAL APTITUDE TEST - CANADIAN (DAT-FORM A&B)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM></EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>Two forms of DAT Canadian were developed in 1988. Form A has been specially adapted for use with High School students, and High School norms are provided. Form B was normed on Community College and university Students.<BR>
DAT is a battery of subtetsts, some or all of which may be administered. Inexpensive computer scoring is available for small or large group administrations of the test.<BR>
Subtests: Verbal Reasoning, Numerical Ability, Abstract Reasoning, Clerical speed & Accuracy, Mechanical Reasoning, Space Relations, Spelling, and Language Usage.<BR>
The subtests VR+NA are often used to give an index of General Ability to Learn. DAT attempts to assess "how well this individual may be expected to learn", rather than "at what grade level should materials in reading, math and science instruction be pitched to suit this individual". The verbal and numeric domains tested determine whether the examinee has the basic enabling skills which will allow him to excel in any course of instruction. <BR>
A Career Planning Questionnaire (CPQ) is optionally included to provide a self report measure of the individual's interests that may be compared with his/her ability as determined by the DAT. A computer scoring option if both DAT & CPQ are administered is also available.<BR>

<BR>This edition of the DAT offers the flexibility of purchasing the subtests separately for use in papplications where only one DAT subtest will be administered. If two or more subtests are to be used, it will be cheaper to purchase the DAT Canadian, which will provide all the subtests plus the benefit of recent Canadian norms. <BR>

<BR>DAT is battery of 8 separately administered subtests. Verbal Reasoning (VR, Numerical Ability (NA), Abstract Reasononing (AR), Mechanical Reasoning (MR), Space Relations (SR), Manual Speed and Accuracy (MSA), Spelling (SP) and Language Usage (LU).<BR>
DAT is widely used in vocational counselling and in pre-employment testing.  The battery comes with a quick interest inventory, though vocational counsellors usually use the test with a more comprehensive interest inventory (like JVIS listed separately in this catalog).<BR>
For pre-employment testing, the level 2 battery is used. The vocational interest test is never used and usually only a subset of the aptitude battery is administered. Frequently the first two subtests (VR & NA), plus any of the other DAT subtests which apply to the job one wishes to test for, are used.<BR>
Exam. kit includes Level 1 Test Bklt., Level 2 Test Bklt., Directions for   Administration, Level 1 and Level 2 Ans.doc with Career Interest Inventory, Perceptual Speed and Accuracy - Part 1 Ans.sheet, Practice Test, and Directions for Administration of Practice Test.<BR>
Machine Scorable Ans. docs. are for use with NCS Sentry Scanners.  Ready-Score answer docs (DAT only) record and score test responses at the same time. Includes one Perceptual Speed and Accuracy - Part 1 answer sheet and one pamphlet, Profiling Your DAT Scores, for each Ready-Score answer document.<BR>
Counselor's manual is a guide to using the DAT in conjuction with the Career  Interest Inventory. Sample score reports and suggestions for interpreting   the reports are included. This manual is not needed for pre-employment testing.<BR>
Level 1 is used with students and or adults who may have academic skills at a grade 7-9 level.<BR>
Level 2 is used with high school students or adults who may have GED or better.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>GENERAL APTITUDE TEST BATTERY, THE (GATB)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM></EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>GATB Measures nine aptitudes with twelve separate tests. The 1986 edition of the GATB is comprised of two test booklets with 4 separately sold answer sheets and two pegboards (small parts and gross motor). The booklets refer to neither imperial nor metric measurement specifically. Canadian norms are available for Parts 1 to 7 of forms  A & B of the test.<BR>
NOTE: Because the pegboards are expensive and realtively difficult to administer, many people opt to use only the first seven GATB aptitude tests (omitting the manual board tests). For normal clients this is probably reasonable. However if information about the level of manual motor coordination of clients is needed, a full administration must be done. For example a full administration is often done if one suspects neurological impairment, as in alcoholics.<BR>
RANGE: Grades 9 to Adult<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: The test may be administered to small groups except for the small parts and gross motor test. Time required is just over one hour. In addition to the answer sheets, Mark Making answer sheets, Indicator sheets, and Estimating sheets will be required. <BR>
SCORING: Users will want to buy a package of the profile forms suitable for the age range of client with whom they will be using the test, although norms may be obtained from the manual section 2.<BR>

<BR>The Service Staff Selector: Word Recognition Test is a quick measure of perceptual speed of closure. The test puports to measure a type of intelligence related to solving practical problems quickly.<BR>
The test presents an individual with words which have been obscurred by only partially printing the letters (mangled words). Two scores are provided. The individual's ability to identify the words correctly identifies his perceptual speed of closure. The amount of times an individual will commit himself to an incorrect answer yields a "risk taking" score which relates to how willing the individual is to proceed without certainty or proper information. The test may be administered to anybody who can read an English language newspaper. <BR>

<BR>This short test provides information about knowledge and ability related to directing others in a work environment. Although this test was developed many years ago, in practice it has been found to be useful as part of a battery of tests used to screen middle and upper management candidates. Low scorers tend not to have the people skills necessary to succeed in positions which require them to direct the work of a team.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>WATSON-GLASER CRITICAL THINKING APPRAISAL</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Watson, Goodwin and Edward M. Glaser</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The Watson-Glaser consists of five subtests which measure the ability to think critically:  drawing sound inferences, recognizing assumptions, reasoning by deduction, drawing conclusions, and evaluating arguments. Exercises involve problems, statements, arguments and interpretations similar to those encountered daily in school and work.  <BR>
RANGE:  Grades 9-12, college students, preprofessionals and professionals<BR>
FORMS:  A and B are alternate equivalent<BR>
NORMS:  Are in the manual for a variety of groups<BR>
ADMINISTRATION:  40-50 minutes, individual or group<BR>
Exam Kit contains a Form A test booklet, an answer sheet & manual<BR>
The Watson-Glaser Short Form (1994) is a new short version which requires only 30 minutes to complete.  It was constructed using a subset of 16 scenarios and 40 items appearing on the Form A version.  It may be more practical for adult assessment in employment selection, training evaluation, career counseling, and much more.  A table of equivalence between form S and form A is included in the Short Form manual.  The regular form B may be used for retesting purposes.  <BR>
NOTE: Our evaluation of the new form S suggests it is not nearly as suitable for making pre-employment decisions as the older forms A & B.<BR>
RANGE:  9th grade reading level or higher<BR>
Exam Kit contains a Form S test booklet, an answer sheet, and a manual.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>EMPLOYMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE INVENTORY (EI/CSI,1993)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM></EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>EI is a 97 item pre-employment screening test which attempts to identify dependable, productive and reliable individuals. High scores indicate that a candidate is likely to take more responsibility for their work, work harder, follow rules have fewer sick days, fewer accidents and injuries, and to stay in the job longer. English and French versions are available.<BR>
CSI is a 64 item test to identify candidates who have a customer service orientation. High scores indicate that the candidate is probably friendly, tactful, stable, and someone who will enjoy helping others. CSI works best in jobs where positive interactions with others are required. Such jobs are typically retail sales people, food service staff, flight attendants, etc. <BR>
EI works best for jobs in which dependable behavior is a major part of satisfactory performance. Jobs where employees must handle money, merchandise, vehicles or property, or must care for the safety of others, are good examples. It has 2 scales -- Performance and Tenure. Performance predicts productive work behaviors. Tenure predicts whether the individual is likely to stay in the job for 90 days or longer. Over 130 post-development criterion validation studies have been conducted, involving over 330,000 individuals.<BR>
EI/CSI is a combined version for use in selecting employees who will be dependable and who will be involved in customer service work or who will need to get along with co-workers. EI/CSI is provided in a single 145 item booklet.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Group 20 minutes<BR>
SCORING: Computer scored. Tests come with an IBM diskette suitable for scoring the volume of tests which you purchase. The scoring software has a decremental counter in it that will only allow you to score the number of tests which you purchase.<BR>

<BR>CDI is an interest inventory which was developed with an emphasis on activities that relate to sales service and technical occupations. It is useful in vocational counselling or in companies wanting information to help place individuals in areas consistent with their measured interests. Examinees are presented with 100 gender fair items that each consist of three statements from which the individual must choose one that best describes him or her.<BR>
The fifteen basic scales measure interest in Administration, Art, Assertiveness, Clerical positions, Food Service, Industrial Arts, Health Service, the Outdoors, Personal Service, being Persuasive, Sales, Science & Technology, Systematic types of work, Teaching/Social Service, and Writing.<BR>
CDI is only computer scored.<BR>
Prepaid test forms can be administered and mailed in for scoring or SigmaSoft can be used to administer the test onscreen on an IBM-PC. Individual administration using the SigmaSoft system has the benefit of immediate feedback. The CDI computer report includes a basic interest profile on the 15 scales listed above, plus a profile for 7 general occupational themes, scores of similarity to 22 broad occupational clusters, narrative summaries of the three most similar clusters, sample occupations and a profile of similarity to over 100 educational/occupational groups.<BR>
Exam Kit includes, manual and one prepaid question/answer document for the extended 12 page report.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>CAREER ORIENTATION PLACEMENT EVALUATION SURVEY (COPES)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Knapp, Robert and Lila F. Knapp</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>COPES (1995) provides information on some personality characteristics that are important in identifying types of work which will be perceived by the client as meeting his/her needs. The values measured are: Investigative vs. Accepting, Practical vs. Carefree, Independence vs. Conformity, Leadership vs. Supportive, Orderliness vs. Flexible, Recognition vs. Privacy, Aesthetic vs. Realistic, and Social vs. Reserved.<BR>
RANGE: Grade 7-adult<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 40-50 minutes.<BR>
COPES is part of the COPS-system of career counselling tests. If all three COPS-system tests are used (COPS, CAPS & COPES), a comprehensive guide should be used in place of the three separate Profile and guide booklets. These guides allow easier integration of the inventory results.<BR>
COPS-System Cluster Charts organize career information into occupational clusters -- which is the most effective way to present the information. A set of 17 large charts (one of each chart) or a package of 25 pocket size condensed charts can be purchased.<BR>
The booklet How to use the COPS-System for Group Guidance contains information for those learning to use the system in career counselling.<BR>
The COPS-System Career Briefs Kit has been revised (1993) to be made current with the new Canadain NOC as well as the U.S. DOT. Over 450 cards describing different occupations are included. On each card is a list of job functions and responsibilities, educational requirements, personality characteristics, expected salary range, anticipated future demand for the occupation, and references.<BR>
COPS-System Career Cluster Booklets (updated 1993), present detailed and comprehensive information of each of the 14 occupational clusters -- including a detailed description of each of the occupations listed in the self-interpretive profile and guides.<BR>
COPS-system Summary guides are for those who have (unfortunately) administered the COPS CAPS & COPES using the separate profile/guides and need access to the integration information that is contained in the comprehensive guides.<BR>

<BR>~ is a 9 dimensional theory of personality for use in business and in human resource training and development. Participants learn to understand interpersonal interactions and the success of business relationships based on application of the "personality-type" theory provided in the course. Trainers will find the materials provide complete support for implementing this versatile system. The system will be useful for sales people who work independently, for team building within any organiation, and for helping diverse sorts of participants learn to get the most out of themselves based on their own individual style.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>FIRO SCALES</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Schutz, Will et al</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>Dr. Schutz described his three dimensional theory of interpersonal    behaviour in his book THE INTERPERSONAL UNDERWORLD (now out of print). The three basic dimensions evaluated by the tests are the needs for Inclusion, Control, and Affection. From this beginning, a large number of FIRO scales have been developed which are used in a variety of settings. <BR>
The FIRO manual (1978) is useful with all FIRO tests (including LIPHE,    VAL-ED, MATE and COPE listed separately in this catalog), discussing their    use, interpretation, and research. Norms are not provided with any of the    FIRO tests.<BR>
FIRO-B is used in measuring relationships and individual characteristics.  It contains six scales and may be purchased in a self-scorable edition.<BR>
Clinical Interpretation of the FIRO-B is a combination Monograph & Series of Locator charts for using the FIRO in training groups, marriagecounselling and psychotherapy.<BR>
Understanding FIRO-B is a pamphlet for distribution to those who have taken  the FIRO which explains the meaning of the six scales.<BR>
Client's Guide to the FIRO-B is a larger pamphlet than the above which  deals with understanding FIRO results in the context of business and  employment related behaviours.<BR>
Psychometric Properties of the FIRO-B is a report on statistical evaluations of FIRO-B which will be of interest to psychologists.<BR>
FIRO-BC is a children's form of the FIRO-B used in upper elementary and junior high in guidance and in clinical psychology settings.<BR>
FIRO-F is identical to the FIRO-B except items are re-phrased to measure feelings instead of behaviours.<BR>
Specimen sets do not include the manual.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>JACKSON VOCATIONAL INTEREST SURVEY (JVIS)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Jackson, Douglas N.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>JVIS is a gender fair, psychometrically designed interest inventory, suitable for use in both the U.S. and Canada. The revised (1994) extended computer report was designed to assist individuals of high school age or older with educational and career planning decisions in today's economy. The basic scales include: creative arts, performing arts, mathematics, physical science, engineering, life science, social science, adventure, nature/agriculture, skilled trades, personal service, family activity, medical service, dominant leadership, job security, stamina, accountability, teaching, social service, elementary education, finance, business, office work, sales, supervision, human relations management, law, professional advertising, author/journalism, academic achievement, technical writing, independance, planfullness, and interpersonal confidence. Ten occupational themes are derived from these 34 basic scales. The extended computer report includes in addition to the above, a profile of similarity to 17 educational field clusters, ranking in terms of similarity of the examinees scores to those of 32 occupational group clusters, and a narrative summary of the three most similar groups.<BR>
The test consists of 289 pairs of forced-choice statements which describe job related activities. In each item, the examinee must choose one of the two alternatives presented that best describes him or her.<BR>
Hand scoring is easily accomplished without the use of a stencil key. Hence the test may be self-scored by examinees if they are able to follow directions accurately. However, the major benefit of the test is obtained via the extended report which is computer generated. The computer based scoring uses Pearson correlation to fit the scale configuration produced by the examinee to configurations produced by groups of workers and professionals engaged in different occupations. A rough approximation of this information is available to counsellors doing hand scoring using information contained in the Occupations Guide (1995).<BR>
SigmaSoft is a computer administered version of JVIS which provides scoring and reporting of responses the examinee enters directly into an IBM-PC. For groups, paper and pencil administration using pre-paid answer sheets will probably be preferred.<BR>
LANGUAGES: English, French, Spanish (English is assummed unless specified on your order).<BR>
RANGE: Secondary School - Adult<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: group, 45 minutes.<BR>
Starter Set: contains Manual, Application Handbook, Test booklet, two handscore answer sheets and two profile/guide forms, plus one pre-paid extended report answer sheet.<BR>
If you have used handscorable answer sheets, but want an Extended Report (app. 12 pages) for your client, mail or fax the answer sheets to us and the scoring can be performed in our office. The cost for this service is 16.50 per scoring (normal shipping charges apply).<BR>

<CENTER><H2>MYERS-BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR (MBTI)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Myers, Isabel Briggs and Katharine C. Briggs</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>MBTI yields four bipolar scales that can be reported as continuous scores, but which are more commonly reduced to a four-letter "type" code. This instrument is widely used in situations where personality must be very simply and quickly defined -- as in management, or interpersonal skills seminars. Descriptions of the 16 possible personality types are easily understood.<BR>
First time users should buy 1 each of stock #1467, #3401, #3402, and #12480. Possibly also one of the various Inro. to Type booklets will be of help.<BR>
The best interpretive information about types is contained in the book "Life Types" (#12480) by Sandra Hirsch, which is listed separately in this catalog.<BR>
Information about the 16 types is provided by the test publisher in many formats. A one page description of types is provided on the report form (stock# 1467). An expanded version of this information is available in the report booklets (stock #4290). More expanded versions of this information are available in the various "Introduction to Type" booklets, which run to approximately 30 pages. At present there are Intro. to Type booklets for Organizational settings, Career counselling, and a generic Intro to Type.<BR>
MBTI's 4 scales indicate relative preferences for: Extraversion-Intraversion, Sensing-Intuition, Thinking-Feeling, Judging-Perceiving.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 20-30 minutes, group.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Rahim, Aflazur</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The Rahim Organizatioal Conflict Inventories (ROCI) are self-report measures of conflict experienced in an organization and varying styles of handling conflicts. ROCI-I assesses three independent dimensions or types of organizational  conflict: Intrapersonal, Intergroup, and Intragroup. ROCI-II assesses five independent styles of handling interpersonel  conflict:Integrating, Obliging, Dominating, Avoiding, and Compromising.  Both inventories use a 5-point Likert scale. <BR>
ROCI-I contains 21 items and can be administered and scored in about 10  minutes. ROCI-II contains three 28-item forms, each requiring approximately  12 minutes to administer and score: Form A, which assesses how one handles  conflict with one's boss; Form B, with one's subordinates: and Form C, with  one's peers. Manual reports limited norms for managerial groups and MBA  students.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>SELF DIRECTED SEARCH (CANADIAN EDITION)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Holland, John L.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>SDS (1994) is a self-administered, self-scored, and self-interpreted  vocational counseling tool. There are two Canadian forms of SDS: Form R (regular), and Form E (easy). SDS Form E was developed for individuals with more limited ability or education.<BR>
To administer SDS form R you will need the Assessment Booklet, and an Occupation Finder Booklet. An optional Alphabetised Occupation Finder is available for supplementary use, that lists occupations by name rather than in order of Holland Code.<BR>
Administration of Form E requires a form E Assessment Booklet and a Job Finder Booklet. The Job Finder Booklet lists only a subset of Occupations Finder -- leaving out jobs like Doctor, Lawyer, etc.<BR>
The Manual is the same for both the US and Canadian edition of the SDS, however, the Occupations Finders and Assessment Booklets are different.<BR>
A Form R French Canadian version (1985) is available, however the manual is only available in English.<BR>
SEE ALSO: The Dictionary of Holland Occupational Codes listed separately in this catalog.<BR>
Specimen Set (for both forms) includes 1 manual, 1 SDS Booklet, 1 SDS form E booklet,  1 Occupations Finder (used with SDS regular form), 1 Jobs Finder (used with  SDS form E), and 1 You and Your Career (a handout to be given to students who receive either edition of the SDS).<BR>

<CENTER><H2>VOCATIONAL PREFERENCE INVENTORY (VPI)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Holland, John L.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>VPI is essentially a brief personality test that employs occupational item content and is based on Holland's theory that occupations can be described in terms of personality characteristics. The VPI has proven useful as an aid to counsellors with those clients who obtain  undifferentiated or ambiguous profiles on other interest tests, because it  usually produces a clear-cut profile.<BR>
Although similar to Holland's Self-Directed Search, the VPI is a psychological inventory rather than a vocational counselling tool. VPI assesses five dimensions not covered by the SDS, but offers less comprehensive career assessment. There are 160 occupations listed, divided into eleven scales:  Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional, Self-Control, Status, Masc/Fem, Infrequency, and Acquiescence.<BR>
New all-in-one test booklet/answer sheet/profile forms are now available for easy administration and scoring, and eliminate the need for separate forms and a key.<BR>
Specimen set includes: manual and 1 booklet/answer sheet/profile combination<BR>
Kit includes: manual and 25 booklet/answer sheet/profile combinations. <BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 15-30 minutes<BR>

<BR>The GBI provides separate checklist-forms for assessing six talent areas:  verbal, visual/spatial, math/science problem-solving, musical, social/leadership, mechanical/technical/inventiveness. Validity studies for these checklists were done at three levels (elementary, high school, and college).  <BR>
Initial referal of students to be considered for enrolment into a gifted program is often done by classroom teachers without recourse to a standardized rating procedure. GBI seeks to provide a framework which -- although still subjective -- can be used to provide an initial identification of students who will receive more in depth evaluation. <BR>
All of the checklists are included in the manual as a set of reproducible masters, and the purchaser is granted the right to copy them for use in a single school.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>TORRANCE TESTS OF CREATIVE THINKING (TTCT)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Torrance, E. Paul</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>TTCT is probably the best available test of creativity. It can be used with a wide age range of clients -- from young school age children to adults. Four important mental characteristics of gifted and talented individuals are assesed: Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. TTCT asks the examinee to produce as many different solutions as he/she can in response to a presented problem. The examinees' responses are then scored based on production (the number of ideas presented) and divergence (the range of different types of ideas produced). Standardized scoring rules are provided which allow comparison of results. This test takes some time to score due to the free-response format. However, our experience has shown that creativity assessment is not  very amenable to the more common multiple choice format. Verbal TTCT uses word-based exercises and Figural TTCT uses  picture-based exercises. Verbal TTCT can be administered orally to students in the K-3 range.<BR>
The authors suggest that scores should be interpreted by persons with psychometric training. The Technical Manual provides norms and validity/reliability data.<BR>
Monograph #1 is titled Survey of uses of the TTCT. Monograph #2 is entitled Using the TTCT to Guide the Teaching of Creative Behavior. Monograph #3 is titled Guidelines for Administration and Scoring: Comments on Using the TTCT.<BR>
Tests include:  20 booklets, directions manual, 20 scoring worksheets & 1 class record sheet.<BR>
Verbal Technical Supplement includes information on recent norming studies for the verbal TTC.<BR>
Examiner's kit includes only the stimuli needed to administer the test (drawings and stuffed animals)<BR>
Streamlined scoring for figural tests is optional but recommended.<BR>
Class sets include 20 booklets, 20 scoring worksheets, admin. directions and group record sheet.<BR>
RANGE: Kindergarten-adult<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 30 minutes, scoring 20 minutes<BR>

<CENTER><H2>CLINICAL ANALYSIS QUESTIONNAIRE (CAQ)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Cattell, Raymond and Samuel Krugg</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>CAQ is intended for general clinical diagnosis and evaluating therapeutic  progress. The questionnaire is divided into two parts. Part one assesses 16  normal personality dimensions -- all analogous to the well known 16 P.F.  scales. Part two assesses hypochondriasis, agitated depression, suicidal  depression, anxious depression, guilt, energy level, boredom, and five  other dimensions in the pathology domain. <BR>
Many psychologists use only part one with normal range clients (especially  in pre-employment testing) as this reduces the time necessary for  examination by half. However this practice will mean a) no information  about the client's psychopathology will be provided b) the second order  factors cannot be worked up from the resulting profile. <BR>
A version of CAQ not listed below is available that includes the entire 16PF in addition to the CAQ items.  Contact us if information on the longer  version is required.<BR>
RANGE: 16 years or older. Grade 6-7 reading level required.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Group or individual in 2 hours (both parts).<BR>
CAQ Introductory Kit includes CAQ Manual (with norms), test booklet,  scoring keys, answer sheet, and individual record folder. <BR>

<CENTER><H2>JACKSON PERSONALITY INVENTORY - REVISED (JPI, 1994)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Jackson, Douglas N.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>JPI-R is a personality inventory primarily used with people of average or better intelligence in counselling/clinical settings, business/industrial settings, and in research, including recreational/sports psychology.<BR>
The test consists of 300 True/False items, that delineate 15 scales which are grouped into 5 major clusters. The 1994 revision: provides updated college norms, provides new norms for blue and white collar workers, renames some of the scales to better reflect scale content, has a new quickscore format which eliminates the need for a key, etc.<BR>
The clusters and scales are as follows....<BR>
ANAYTICAL: Complexity, Breadth of Interest, Innovation, and Tolerance.<BR>
EMOTIONAL: Empathy, anxiety, Cooperativeness<BR>
EXTROVERTED: Sociability, Social Confidence, Energy Level<BR>
OPPORTUNISTIC: Social Astuteness, Risk Taking<BR>
DEPENDABLE: Organization, Traditional Values, Responsibility<BR>
Hand scoring takes approximately 3 minutes. Mail in scoring provides verbal descriptions of high and low scores for each scale, profiles the 5 cluster scores, provides the administrative indices and prints out a table of responses. The SigmaSoft option allows for computer administration and scoring of the JPI's 300 items.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>PERSONAL ORIENTATION DIMENSION (POD)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Shostrom, Everett L.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>POD is a measure of attitudes and values in terms of concepts of the  actualizing person - one who is more fully functioning and lives a more  enriched life.  The POD represents a refinement and extension of concepts  first measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) and meets the  need of counselors, therapists and personnel administrators for a  comprehensive objective measure of concepts in humanistic psychology.  The  POD makes operational the theoretical work of Maslow and the rhythmic  polarity concepts of the author.  POD items are comparatively  non-threatening which facilitates communication of the results and  provides a positive approach to personality assessment.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>PERSONALITY RESEARCH FORM (PRF, 1984)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Jackson, Douglas N.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>PRF yields 22 scores for broad personality traits relevant to the functioning of normal individuals in a variety of settings. Based on Murray's framework for the description of personality, PRF focusses on areas of normal functioning rather than on psychopathology. it is therefore perhaps most useful in organizational and educational settings.<BR>
The current revision (1984) of PRF is form E, which is comprised of 352 true-false items. Scales include: Absement, Achievement, Affilliation, Aggression, Autonomy, Change, Cognitive Stucture, Defendence, Desireability, Dominance, Endurance, Exhibition, Harmavoidance, Impulsivity, Infrequency, Nurturance, Order, Play, Sentience, Social Recognition, Succorance, and Understanding.<BR>
The wording of this test is simplified as much as possible to allow administration with low literacy individuals and young people. the test may be hand scored, or one of two computer generated reports can be purchased. The basic report is 2 pages long and provides scores on the PRF scales plus preprinted verbal descriptions of what each scale measures. The extended report provides scores for the PRF scales plus scores on 8 vocational preference scales. Introductory text and prose descriptions of the scales makes the extended report easier for examinees to understand.<BR>
the SigmaSoft system allows onscreen administration and scoring of PRF on an IBM-PC.<BR>
RANGE: 6 years - adult<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: group, 1 hour.<BR>
AVAILABLE FORMS: E (352 items, low literacy): Older forms of the test are still available. AA and BB (440 items): A and B (300 items).<BR>

<CENTER><EM>McNair, Douglas M. et al</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>POMS measures dimensions of affect or mood and has proved to be useful for  assessing psychiatric outpatients and their responses to various therapeutic approaches. POMS consists of 65 adjectives describing feeling and mood to which the client responds according to a five-point scale ranging from Not at all to Extremely. The scales have been widely used in many drug evaluation studies and have been recommended for use as a measure of change in psychotherapy. The Six scales are: tension-anxiety, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatique-inertia, confusion-bewilderment. <BR>

<BR>QRS will be helpful in answering the question: Can this family survive looking after a family member who requires constant care. It measures stress in families who are caring for ill or disabled members. It assesses the impact of an illness or handicap on the responder and on the other family members, and provides information about a variety of problem areas. Clinical cases used in the development of the QRS included developmental disabilities, psychiatric problems, renal disease, cystic fibrosis, neuromuscular disease, and cerebral palsy.<BR>
QRS is a 285 item true-false inventory, yielding 15 subtest scores each providing information about different aspects of family stress. Norms are based on research with 329 clinical cases and 107 normal families.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>BASIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY (BPI)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Jackson, Douglas N.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>BPI is a multiphasic personality inventory intended for use with both clinical and normal populations to identify sources of maladjustment and of personal strengths. BPI may be used with a variety of adolescent and adult groups. Consisting of 240 true/false items, 11 substantive clinical scales and one critical item scale are provided. <BR>
Scales include: hypochondriasis, anxiety, depression, thinking disorder, denial, impulse expression, interpersonal problems, social introversion, alienation, self depreciation, persecutory ideas, and deviation (critical item scale).<BR>
Scale construction was designed to emphasize the substantive relationship between item content and the construct underlying the scale. Empirical item selection procedures highlighted convergent and discriminant item properties, suppression of desirability responding, and scale homogeneity and generalizability. Separate adult and adolescent norms are reported in the manual. The BPI may be hand scored in less than 10 minutes, using a single template and profile sheets with male and female norms on alternative sides. <BR>
Examination kit for handscoring includes: manual, 10 reusable test booklets, scoring template, 25 hand scorable answer sheets, and 25 profile sheets plus one prepaid coupon for a mail in computer generated report.<BR>
The SigmaSoft system provides for computer administration and scoring of the test. Software contains a counter that requires a per case fee for scoring the test.<BR>

<BR>The Derogatis Psychiatric Rating Scale, formerly known as the Hopkins   Psychiatric Rating Scale, is a multidimensional psychiatric rating scale.    Designed for use with the SCL-90-R or BSI self-report instruments, the DPRS   can help validate patient-reported results.  The DPRS enables the clinician   to rate his observations of a patient's psychological symptomatic distress   on the same nine primary dimensional scales as measured by the SCL-90-R and   BSI (Brief Symptom Inventory).  The patient can also be rated on eight   additional dimensions considered important to accurate clinical assessment.   A brief form of the DPRS is also available.

<CENTER><H2>EMOTIONAL PERCEPTION TEST</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Allen, Lyle</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ was devised to measure the examinee's ability to judge emotion expressed in another person's voice. The stimuli are presented using an ordinary cassette tape recorder (no headphones necessary). Three simple sentences are presented which are spoken by an actress on the stimulus tape using five different emotions (making 15 different items). The series is repeated three times in order to conduct the test (so you collect 45 responses from the patient). The patient reasponds by pointing to the correct emotion from among five emotions which are presented on a card.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Individual 5 minutes (short form 3 minutes).<BR>
RANGE: Adults<BR>
EPT is still in development and is expected to be released in early 1997. Norms from adults are from the work of Dr. Ivan Kiss, Glenrose Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The five emotions, ranked from the hardest to the easiest to discriminate (based on the normal controls' results on the EPT) are:<OL><BR>
<LI>Happy (hardest for normals to discriminate on EPT)<BR>
<LI>Angry<BR>
<LI>Frightened<BR>

<BR>FSS was designed to provide quantitative information about a great variety of possible sources of maladaptive emotional reactions.  <BR>
The use of quantitative information about fear will be of great    use in behaviour therapy. Since it is necessary in the application of suchtherapy to obtain a coherent picture of the stimulus antecedents of    neurotic reactions, FSS can frequently save a great deal of effort by    revealing the reaction to many stimulus classes in a short time.<BR>

<BR>IMI is a method of assessing personality by measuring the  attitudes and feelings that the person being studied arouses in the  respondent. In seeking to understand a client, counselors  frequently ask themselves... "How does this client make me feel"? The IMI  provides a systematic device to measure these reactions, providing  15 scales of interpersonal styles based on the work of Lorr and his colleagues. These scales may be combined to provide cluster scores labeled Dominant, Hostile, Submissive, and Friendly. The 90 items on the test are rated on a 4-point scale and are readily tabulated without stencils.<BR>
Specimen Set includes a manual, anwer sheet, 1 booklet for assessing  attitudes toward male clients and 1 booklet for assessing attitudes toward  female clients.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 15 minutes <BR>
RANGE: Older adolescents and adults.<BR>
Specimen sets contain all materials. Permission sets allow the purchaser to make up to 200 copies in a single calendar year. Specimen sets may be upgraded to permissions by paying the difference.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Millon, Theodore</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>MCMI-3 is the 3rd (1994) revision of the MCMI.  This brief (95 item) instrument provides a measure of 22 personality styles and clinical syndromes for adults undergoing psychological or psychiatric assessment or treatment. The 22 scales and three correction scales are divided into five categories: Modifier Indices; Clinical Personality Pattern Scales; Severe Pathology Scales; Clinical Syndrome Scales; and Severe Clinical Syndrome Scales. When hand scoring, a worksheet is used for tabulating item weights. The author's theory that most personality disorders have overlapping content is expressed in this test having items which are scored in more than one scale. This means that the scales are highly intercorrelated because they are based in part on the same items.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Hathaway, S.R. and J.C. McKinley</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This new revision of MMPI provides a 577 item questionnaire with no    duplicate items (the original MMPI was 550 items with 16 exactduplicates). MMPI-2 can be purchased in either hardcover or    softcover edition -- though the test is priced to discourage use of the hardcover edition. <BR>
The test revision involved two major changes. New norms for the basic clinical scales were provided and the item pool was expanded to include items useful on some new content scales. <BR>
Though MMPI-1 scales were completely renormed, interpreting these scales  requires equating the new "numbers" to the rresearch database of interpretive information (which was based on the old system of scoring). <BR>
For those who use special scales, a table  provided in the manual enables   translation from MMPI-1 Group Form item  numbers to MMPI-2 item numbers and vice-versa. Thus, if the items on which your own scale is based are still included in the table, you can easily make up your own key and score your research scales from the new edition questionnaires. The MMPI-2/MMPI Interpretive Manual (Greene, 1991 listed separately in this catalog) is a good source of information on interpreting the MMPI.<BR>
The Microtest System requires specific hardware and software for in-house     scoring which must be obtained through NCS. Arion II is a Teleprocessing Service where data is transmitted from your computer to NCS for scoring and reports are received on your own printer.<BR>
Computer scoring of this test is expensive on a per case basis. No system exists whereby one can buy a computer scoring program that can be used an unlimited number of times to score this test -- unless the authors violate the test publisher's copyright. <BR>

<CENTER><EM>Zuckerman, Marvin and Bernard Lubin.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>MAACL-R measures affects of Anxiety, Depression and Hostility. 132  adjectives are available for administration under two standardized test  sets, In General, and Today Now.<BR>
Additional scales have been developed based on factor analysis. These are  Positive Affect and Sensation Seeking. Both trait and state forms on the  new MAACL-R are standardized scales which have been shown to differentiate  patients with affective disorders from other types of patients as well as  from normals. It is anticipated that the revised MAACL scales will be even  more useful than the earlier scales in studies of stress and stress  reduction, diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders, and in basic  research on personality and emotions.<BR>
Two summary scores obtained are: Dysphoria (Dys=A+D+H) and Positive Affect  and Sensation Seeking (PASS=PA+SS) <BR>
RANGE: high school, college, and adult<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 5 minutes for either form<BR>
Specimen Set includes manual and 1 copy of all forms.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT INVENTORY (1991)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Morey, Leslie C.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This current comprehensive inventory of adult psychopathology contains 344 items comprising 22 full scales: 4 validity, 11 clinical, 5 treatment, and 2 interpersonal scales. Items are in a 4 point Likert format. <BR>
PAI is administered and scored in less than one hour. A critical items form lists 27 items which have been identified based on indication of a potential crisis and having a very low endorsement rate in normal individuals.<BR>
Comprehensive Kit for hand scoring includes: manual, 2 reusable booklets, 2 administration folios, 25 answer sheets, 25 adult profile forms, and 25 critical items forms.<BR>
The test is quickly hand scored without keys using the self-scoring carbonless answer sheet. If the test is used a great deal, the computer scoring software will be of great benefit, as it produces a narrative report of approximately 13 pages and saves even more time.<BR>
Comprehensive kit for computer scoring contains software, Manual, 2 reusable booklets, and 25 answer forms. Five bonus computer administrations are provided. PAR scoring system requires a VGA or EGA monitor and IBM compatible PC. It comes with everything you need to begin using PAI, and producing your own computer generated narrative reports. We recommend that users administer the test using the print materials and then have a secretary enter the client responses into the computer scoring software. A useful report of 12-13 pages in length is produced.<BR>
NORMS: U.S. census matched sample of 1,000 community dwelling adults, sample of 1,246 patients from 69 different clinical sites, college sample of 1051 students.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Holmes, Thomas H.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>SRE is a questionnaire that can be given to a client/patient to find out whether and how often various stress producing events have occurred in his or her life during the recent past. SRE is unique among the life-event questionnaires in wide use today, in that each event included on it has been selected because it was observed in a large number of patients prior to the onset of their illness.  The SRE evolved from Adolf Meyer's "life chart". Beginning in 1949, 5,000 case histories of patients with a variety of disorders were reviewed, along with chronologically arranged information provided by the patient about his or her recent experiences.<BR>

<BR>SPLASH has been developed to codify verbal interaction between patient and    therapist in a structured way so that one can devise rules about the    interaction, when trying to discover what kinds of verbal interactions by    the therapist lead to change in the patient. Five main variables are    addressed, the object, viewpoint, and frame of reference under discussion;    the affects; impulses; coping strategies; and the interpersonal messages    contained in each unit of analysis.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT OF PAIN</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Pendrake Inc.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ is widely used evaluation system, intended for use with chronic pain patients who have been referred for psychological evaluation and/or treatment. The system is comprised of two questionnaires (BAP and post-BAP), plus an optional screener. The comprehensive BAP samples information about psychosocial factors that might influence pain. The post-treatment evaluation (post-BAP) samples information about the effectiveness of treatment and residual problems.<BR>
BAP yields a total score "disability index" of pain and 35 separate clinical scales. The computer generated report runs to 17 pages. Post-BAP yields similar information. The Post-BAP computer scoring program allows analysis of the significance of changes over the course of treatment -- since the BAP was administered.<BR>
The screening inventory (called BAP-SI) may be used to determine if assessment with the two comprehensive forms is warranted.<BR>
BAP-SI introductory packet includes software, BAP-SI manual, one BAP-SI booklet and 5 BAP-SI Answer sheets. <BR>

<BR>CDI assesses cognitive, affective, and behavioral signs of depression.    It requires at least a first grade reading level and was designed for   school-aged children and adolescents.  New to the CDI are the quickscore forms in which responses can be recorded onto the scoring sheet itself to be easily computed and plotted on the back profile.  The new manual gives directions for using quickscore, documents the development of the CDI, and also gives an annotated bibliography summarizing 144 studies of the CDI.<BR>
CDI short form is used as a screeing measure with comparable results to the regular form, but is composed of only 10 items.  The regular forms can be used for factor scores, a more complete description of symptoms, or when more extensive clinical information is required.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN YOUTH SCALE (1994)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Newcomer, P., Barenbaum, E. & Bryant, B.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This is a set of three scales (student, teacher and parent) used in determining major depressive disorder and overanxious disorder in children/youths. The test has been designed for classroom screening of suspected depression that may be used to evaluate the need for referral and to provide information to the school or community treatment resource person to whom the student is referred. The student questionnaire is 40 items long (18 depression, 16 anxiety, and 6 validity items). The teacher questionnaire is 30 items long (18 depression and 12 anxiety items). The parent questionnaire is 45 items long (20 depression, 13 anxiety and 12 social maturity items). The student form uses a five point format 0 (not at all) - 4 (all the time). The parent and teacher scales are true-false and ask the responder to identify the presence or absence of a symptom.<BR>
An education setting based assessment of depression is an important tool due to the increased incidence of suicide and other maladaptive behavior patterns linked to depression and anxiety in school-age youth.<BR>

<BR>~ (1994) is a workbook (with an agoraphobia supplement section) for treating anxiety and panic disorders. One of the authors D. Barlow has written widely on this subject, is a well-known expert on anxiety and panic, and owns and operates anxiety and panic disorder clinics in New York. The authors have studied the cognitive-behavioral treatment methods presented in the workbook and suggest that they offer results that are as effective as the available drug maintenance alternatives.<BR>
The Client videotape series (4 tapes) depicts Dr. Craske conducting sessions and explaining the techniques used. For those unfamiliar with PCT, the tapes explain and demonstrate the physical and psychological sensations of panic attacks, the erroneous appraisals and attitudes that play an important role in panic disorder, and how they come to be changed.<BR>
The therapist set of 10 training videotapes depict the main features of cognitive therapy with anxiety and panic patients. The tapes include: introduction to the 3-reponse model of anxiety, description of the physiology of anxiety, voluntary hyperventialtion and breathing retraining part 1, breathing retraining part 2, identifying and challenging catastrophic thinking, reactivity to symptom induction exercises and interoceptive exposure, hypothesis testing part 1, hypothesis testing part 2, hypothesis testing part 3, hypothesis testing part 4.<BR>

<BR>PSPI was developed to provide a standardized and reliable method of    evaluating a number of psychosocial factors considered to be important in    maintaining and exacerbating chronic pain problems. The PSPI includes    evaluation of the following factors: several forms of secondary gain; the    effects of pain behavior on interpersonal relationships; the existence of    stressful life events that may contribute to subjective distress or promote   avoidance learning; and components of past learning history that familiarize the patient with the chronic invalid role and with its personal and social consequences. PSPI ratings also consider the fact that patients differ in the degree to which they are likely to be influenced by potential sources of secondary gain.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Spielberger, Charles D.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>STAI is widely used as a measure of anxiety. It consists of two equivalent  20-item self-report scales designed to assess anxiety-proneness (trait form  Y-2) and current levels of anxiety (state form Y-1). The test is easily  administered and scored and is ideal for studying anxiety reduction in therapy.<BR>
STAIC is a special form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for use with  children.<BR>
Over 3,600 published studies have been done using these instruments since their publication in 1968.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 10 minutes per form.<BR>
BIBLIOGRAPHY: The separate bibliography contains over 2,600 references for the STAI indexed by area of research.<BR>
WORKBOOK: A computer generated anxiety workbook (approximately 40 pp.) is available. The personalized workbook is based on a completed STAI questionnaire which is faxed or mailed in for scoring. A generic anxiety-therapy workbook may be purchased which includes all of the passages that the computer might use to construct the personalized workbook. The generic workbook is sold as a duplicating master. A per case fee is charged for each reproduction of the workbook you intend to make.<BR>
Specimen sets include all materials. Permission sets allow the purchaser to reproduce up to 200 copies of the test in a single calendar year. Specimen sets may be upgraded to permissions by paying the difference.<BR>

<BR>WMS-R (1987) is an individually administered, standardized memory scale for  clinical use. It is useful as a part of a general neuropsychological  battery for adults and is designed to yield detailed information about an  individual's memory functioning.  New norms permit comparison to a current  population sample. Subtests: (Figural Memory, Visual Paired Associates, and  Visual Memory Span) measure the examinee's memory for nonverbal material.  In addition, two of the verbal subtests (logical Memory and Verbal Paired  Associates) and two of the non-verbal subtests (Visual Paired Associates  and Visual Reproduction) are administered twice to provide separate  estimates of immediate and delayed recall.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Green, Paul and Lyle M. Allen III</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>WMT is a visual paired associates task. As a memory test it has excellent psychometric properties. Six subtests are included. Subjects are asked to memorize 40 words presented in a paired-associates format. The learning list is presented twice and the subject effort is assessed in an immediate recognition (IR) subtest. One half hour later a Delayed recognition (DR) subtest is administered. Other subtests are Multiple Choice Recognition (MC), Paired Associates Recall (PA), Free Recall (FR) which use the same 40 stimulus words. An optional Long Delayed Free Recall (LD-FR) subtest may be given 20 minutes after FR. <BR>
WMT is a dual purpose instrument in that it can be used simultaneously to assess memory and malingering. The computer scores the test and reports the results. Software is DOS based and is good for unlimited uses.<BR>
The author's have done extensive research into the detection of malingering in neuropsychological cases.<BR>
Computerized Assessment of Response Bias (CARB) is a feigning/malingering test masquerading as a memory test. It is administered by a microcomputer and is primarily useful in conjunction with WMT.<BR>
A mallingering battery comprised of the WMT and the CARB provides the most reliable information about malingering. The battery is recommended for use with all clients suspected of malingering and with any clients for whom opportunity for secondary gain exists. It was specifically designed to be used in cases where a personal injury claims exist.<BR>
Research by the authors has indicated...<BR>
<UL><BR>
<LI>it may be necessary to administer more than one symptom validity test to reliably assess subject effort.<BR>
<LI>Severe misclassification problems were encountered when using CVLT, 21 Items test or Warrington's RMT to assess symptom validity and subject effort.<BR>
<LI>Experienced psychologists were uniformly unable to fake impaired memory on the WMT even when told prior to administration that the WMT is a malingering test.<BR>

ASPECT is a technique for integrating data from tests such as WAIS-R, WRAT-R or Norris Educational Achievement Test; Draw a Family, CAT or TAT; an IQ measure for the child; plus the 68-item ASPECT parent questionnaire.<BR>
The technique is completed by the clinician who responds to 56 items (true or false) giving information about the client obtained from the above measures. NORMS: The authors stadardized this technique using data from approximately 60 family assessments.<BR>
Many custody and access experts do not use the whole technique, but just use the 56 item true-flase questionnaire.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>CHILD ABUSE POTENTIAL INVENTORY (CAP)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Milner, Joel S.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The CAP is a 160 item forced choice agree-disagree inventory. It attempts to predict whether or not an adult respondent is likely to physically abuse a child.  Three response distortion scales are included: lie scale, Random Responding and Response Inconsistency.  An abuse score is provided, plus 6 factor scores. The factor scores are Distress, Rigidity, Unhappiness, Problems with Self and Child, Problems from Family, and Problems with Others.<BR>
The abuse scale has been shown to be resonably sensitive in clinical use. <BR>
The unlimited use computer scoring software is by far the easiest way to obtain test results. If ordering hand scoring keys, users must select either the BASIC keys (4 stencils) or the complete set (all 10 stencils). We recommend the complete set of hand scoring keys as uses can still elect to score only the basic 4 scales. <BR>

<CENTER><EM>Fox, Robert A.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ is an objective measure of how parents are raising their young children and provides information anbout parenting style. Professionals can use PBC so that educational and intervention efforts can be tailored to a client's particular parenting style. Three scales are derived from 100 4-point likert items. Scales are: Expectations (50 items), Discipline (30 items), Nurturing (20 items). Most of the items are developmental in nature -- i.e. do you expect your child to be able to do X. Parents are asked to select either: always, frequently, hardly ever, never. Since reasonable expectations for a child are always age specific, the manual provides separate norms for the questionnaire at various age levels (see the age range listed below). The test is not useful outside the age-ranges listed.<BR>
Norms: 1140 mothers (representative sample taken from a large urban area). <BR>
RANGE: 1-0 yr. to 4-11 yr.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>PARENTING STRESS INDEX (PSI)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Abidin, Richard R.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ (3rd edition, 1995) identifies stress in parents. The most widely used form of this inventory consists of 101 items in a 5-point (strongly agree-strongly disagree) format. A lesser used 36-item short form is available.<BR>

Short Form Starter Set includes Short Form Manual and 20 booklets<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Group or individual 30 minutes<BR>

<BR>This widely used technique provides an  objective inferred rating of a   child's self-concept. A teacher, parent or  counsellor rates the frequency   of each of 30 described behaviours on a five  point scale (from Never to   Always). This scale requires no responses from  the child, so it may be   used with children who cannot communicate in  English and may be used   repeatedly for monitoring changes in targeted  behaviours. <BR>

<CENTER><EM>Bracken, Bruce A.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ (1994) provides a global self-concept measure, which can be subdivided into six distinct, normed scales. The scales, entitled Social, Competence, Affect, Academic, Family and Physical, each provide information about an important area of psycho-social functioning of children and adolescents. The six scales each have 25 items (MSCS items n=150). The manual provides extensive information on the rationale for test constructs and cites current research which supports the test. Information to allow integration of MSCS results with over 100 other psychoeducational measures is also provded. Thorough work has been done on construct development and validity. Assessment of results across race and gender partitioning of the stadardization sample demonstrate that the test is gender-fair and non-discrimianting in terms of age and race.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Conners, Keith</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ is a 1997 revision of Conner's Teacher and Parent Rating Scales. The checklists have been completely revised and re-normed. The CRS are meant to sample behavior problems and possible ADD/ADHD related behaviors. The author has been a long time researcher and writer on the topic of ADD/ADHD. CRS now has a form that is to be completed by the child if they are old enough to respond (Youth form). Parallel information can be collected about behaviors from the subject themselves, their parents and their teacher. Professionals will require the Technical Manual, and one of the long or short forms of the questionnaires. The questionnaires are self-scoring. An interpretive brochure is sold separately for giving feedback to the respondent who completed the questionnaire.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>CONNERS' CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TEST</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Conners, Keith, C.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ is a microcomputer-based tool that presents a task much like the child's game of simon says. The innovative theory on which the test is based is that ADD subjects will be less able to learn this task than normal clients. Correlation research is presented in the manual and in journal publications to support this contention. However, no claim is made that the test provides an infallible diagnosis of attention deficit in any individual case.<BR>
The task is to respond in one of two different ways when given a visual cue on the computer monitor. The computer then plays the cues with a varying length of time in between presentations, and records the subject's ability to perceive and respond correctly to the presented stimulus. The task involves visual processing, immediate motor response, and a decision as to which of two responses to make.<BR>
The software is now provided for an unlimited number of uses<BR>

<BR>This 29 item rating scale completed by teachers provides information about the child's behavior in social recreational and learning situations. For each of the items up to 7 descriptors are privided. The teacher marks those that apply. The ASCA provides cores for Attention deficit-hyperactive, Solitary aggressive (provocative), Solitary Agressive (impulsive), Oppositional defiant, Diffident, and Avoidant.  Two supplementary scales: Delinquent, and Lethargic can also be scored. The first 4 syndromes represent an overactivity scale, the last 2 are combined into an underactivity scale.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Brown, Linda and D.D. Hammill</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>BRP-2 consists of a series six of normed instruments some or all of which may be used to gather information about a youth being referred for assessment of problem behavior. Information gathered provides and indication of severity, and settings in which the behaviors occur. Student rating scales for home and classroom are completed by the target students themselves. The Parent/caregiver rating scale provides information about domestic behavior. The Teacher rating scale provides information on the student's perceived classroom behavior. The peer rating scale and the sociogram provide unique information in terms of peer perceptions of the student. The sociogram may be especially interesting, because it provides norm referenced information about the student's sociometric standing within the classroom. The student rating scale is presented in a single 60 item quesitonnaire, which is administered both to the student and to classmates.<BR>
RANGE: 6.6-18.6 years<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 20 minutes, individual<BR>
Kit includes: Manual, 50 each of Teacher, Parent and Student Rating Scale    Forms, and 50 Profile Sheets<BR>

<CENTER><H2>CAREY TEMPERAMENT SCALES (1995)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Fullard, William; Sean McDevitt, William Carey et al</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>Based on the work of Alex Thomas and Stella Chess in the New York Longitudinal Studies (1963), the CTS was developed to assess the temperament of children using the NYLS temperament characteristics. Five age-specific questionnaires make up the CTS. The appropriate questionnaire (based on the child's age) is completed by the parent or care-giver who is most familiar with the child. The completed questionnaire is best computer-scored though it may be hand scored in about 25 minutes. A test manual is included with each scoring program purchased. <BR>
For further reading see the text <em>Temperament in Clinical Practice</em> by Thomas & Chess, listed separately in this catalog.<BR>
Each of the five CTS questionnaires yields 9 bi-polar scales entitled: Activity, Adaptability, First Reaction, Mood, Strength of Response, Distractibility, Persistence, Sensory Reactivity, and Predictability. Items are 6 point likert format and are endorsed 1 (almost never) to 6 (almost always).<BR>
RANGE: <XMP><BR>
EITQ  1-4  months   86 items<BR>
RITQ  4-11 months  105 items<BR>
TTS   1-3  years   107 items<BR>
BSQ   3-7  years   110 items<BR>
MCTQ  8-12 years   109 items</XMP><BR>
ADMINISTRATION: parent or care-givers, 40 minutes, group or individual<BR>
Note: Do not be confused the choices offered here. The authors have made provision for buying per-case scoring or a software package which may be used for an unlimited number of cases. You must select the most economical package based on the volume of cases you expect to score. The test manual is included with each unlimited disk or per-case disk purchased. The per-case software will score any of the 5 questionnaires, the unlimited disks score only one of the 5 questionnaires. The manual is not included with orders for additional forms.<BR>
Those who are handscoring should not purchase the packages of additional forms, as these are meant for computer scoring and do not contain the worksheets you will need to hand score the test.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Achenbach, T.M.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The CBCL-R, and related inventories published by Dr. Achenbach are among    the most widely used behaviour assessment tools available for use with schoolage children. The Parent edition (CBCL 4-18) is used to obtain parents' reports of children's competencies and problems.  The Youth Self-Report (YSR) is filled out by youths with at least a 5th grade reading level. The Teacher's Report Form (TRF) obtains teachers' ratings of students' problems, and is a companion instrument to the CBCL 4-18.<BR>
Many people who are ordering the inventories for the first time will be   confused by the number of forms available under this title.  We suggest   that first time users start with the Manual for the CBCL, 1 package of CBCL for ages 4-18, 1 package of boys profiles, 1 package of girls profiles, and the scoring keys.<BR>
If you plan to use the instrument a great deal the computer scoring option will be more cost effective than hand scoring, as you won't have to buy profile forms or hand scoring stencils. This is especially true if you want to use the Parent Questionnaire, TRF and the YSR together. The computer scoring option "Cross-Informant Report Software" and one package of each of CBCL 4-18, YSR & TRF is the "best buy". Although software may be purchased for each of the three companion instruments separately, the Cross-Informant software scores all three instruments separately OR provides analysis of the differences in perceptions of teacher versus parent, etc. when more than one instrument is used.<BR>
All Software sold under this title is provided without copy protection and is licensed for an unlimited number of uses on a single PC.<BR>
The scanning software package can process forms via fax, image scanners, or reflective-read scanners. Information is sent to an IBM compatible computer and converts it to input for the appropriate scoring software. NOTE: Computer scoring programs must be pruchased separately. Fax and Image scanners require Teleform or Remark software. Reflective-Read scanners require ScanTools, ScanBook, or TopScore software.<BR>
The specimen set contains one copy of all the printed test forms under this title and is provided for content assessment only (each form is stamped SAMPLE).  The Client-Entry program (unlimited usage) allows parents, youths, or teachers to enter data directly into the computer.  Data is scored immediately using the CBCL/4-18, YSR, TRF, or Cross-Informant program.<BR>

<BR>CAT is a classic projective personality measure that reveals the child's level of reality testing and judgment, control and regulation of drives, object relations, thought processes, ability to regress adaptively, defenses, etc. Originally prepared  as a downward extension of Murray's Thematic Apperception Tests (listed  separately in this catalog), the CAT consists of ten drawings of animals in various social situations. The Supplement (CAT-S), with a separate manual, is a set of ten irregularly shaped pictures of animals for further exploration of tension. The CAT-H consists of human figures in situations that parallel the CAT animal pictures; it was prepared as an upward extension of the CAT for use with older children or in research.<BR>
The Complete Kit contains one package of each of the forms you will require, plus each of the CAT-A, CAT-S and CAT-H picture card sets. <BR>

<BR>House-Tree-Person and Draw A Person Test as Measures of Abuse in Children: presents a system of administering, scoring and analysing the results of these common psychological procedures. The examiner asks the child to complete the two drawings which are then scored for the presence or absence of signs of abuse -- within 4 major categories: Preoccupation with Sexually Relevant Concepts (SRC), Aggression and Hostility (AH), Withdrawal and Guarded Accessibility (WGA) and Alertness for Danger - Suspiciousness - Lack of Trust (ADST). Sample drawings are included to illustrate the scoring as described by the author. Explanation of the empirical testing of the scoring system is given, along with some case studies in which the  technique was used.<BR>

<BR>There are two tests developed by Carl Jesness for use in clinical  assessment of adolescent behaviour: the Jesness Inventory of Adolescent  Personality (JI) and the Jesness Behaviour Checklist (JBC). Both tests may be used  separately. <BR>
Supplementary scales developed from the JI yield a classification of Interpersonal Maturity Level which is useful to treatment staff or educators in classifying juvenile offenders. <BR>
The Jesness Behavior Check List is an 80-item scale measuring 14 bi-polar  behavioral tendencies among adolescents. A self-report form and an observer  form of the checklist allows comparison of self-image versus treatment  staff and parental perspective.<BR>
The Jesness Adolescent Personality Inventory consists of 155 items making up 10 scales: Social Maladjustment, Value Orientation, Immaturity, Autism,  Alienation, Manifest Aggression, Withdrawal, Social Anxiety, Repression,  Denial and the composite Asocial Index. <BR>
JI Kit includes: manual, classification of juvenile offender manual, supplementary manual, 10 JI test booklets and 25 quickscore forms.<BR>
JBC kti includes 25 Observer forms, 25 Self-appraisal forms, manual and scoring keys.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>KID MOD:EMPOWERING CHILDREN/YOUTH THROUGH REINFORCEMENT</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Kaplan, Joseph, Mary Gail Wald</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ is a program to teach special education students to get what they want from themselves and others (teachers, parents & siblings), using positive refinforcement, extinction and socially acceptable techniques. It discourages students from resorting to tantrums, running away, or other unproductive or antisocial behaviors. Scripted lessons for direct instruction are combined with peer tutoring and role playing. Eight units are included. Mastery learning is emphasized, and criterion tests are provided with each nit that a student needs to pass before moving on to the next unit.<BR>
UNITS: Rationale for learning (what would you like to change about yourself and others). Behavior (what is it and why do we behave in various ways). Rewards (what are they and how do we earn them). Positive Reinforcement-PR (how does it fit in with behaviors and rewards). Using PR to Change Ourselves (self-management). Using PR to change others (classmates parents siblings teachers). Extinction (what it is and how it works). Using Extinction (how to extinguish undesireable behaviors in others -- like teasing, manipulation, criticism).<BR>
Kid mod is most appropriate for use with mild to moderate behavior problems.<BR>
RANGE: ages 8-12 (adaptations can be used with children who have low levels of reading and writing -- but expressive and receptive language are required).<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Nadine Lambert, Henry Leland, Kazuo Nihira</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ (1993), can be used to assess the current level of functioning of children who may show signs of mental retardation, autism, and other behavioral disorders. Nine behavior domains are measured in part one: independent functioning, physical development, economic activity, language development, numbers/time, vocation, self-direction, responsibility, and socialization. Part two measures social maladaptation.<BR>
The first edition of this instrument was called AAMD adaptive behavior scale -- the name was changed when the organization which sponsored the instrument changed its name to American Association for Mental Retardation (AAMR).<BR>
Complete kit includes: manual, 25 booklets, and 25 profile forms.<BR>
RANGE: 3-18 years<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Individual, approximately 15-30 minutes<BR>
COMPUTER SCORING: unlimited uses, IBM type computers. A MAC version is available which requires that users have "Hypercard" installed.<BR>

<BR>~ (1986), evaluates the functional, daily living skills of school age students. This information is helpful in the identification of students who are believed to be mentally retarded or emotionally disturbed. The full battery consists of five subtests: Self-Care Skills, Communication Skills, Social Skills, Academic Skills, and Occupational Skills. All five scales are normed independently and may be used singularly or together, In addition a 50-item short form of the test is available. Research listed in the manual supports the validity of the ABI for use in distinguishing between retarded individuals and normals, and between mild, moderate and severe/profound retardates. <BR>

<CENTER><H2>SOCIO-SEXUAL KNOWLEDGE & ATTITUDES TEST (SSKAT)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Wish, Joel et al</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>SSKAT can be used with persons who are mentally retarded, and with other  persons whose language is limited. Although normative data is based on  developmentally disabled persons aged 18-42, it is believed SSKAT is also a  valuable instrument in determining sexual knowledge and attitudes of  non-retarded persons of all ages.  Persons to be tested must have visual  and verbal comprehension, but the requirement for expressive language is  minimal, since responses to most questions on 13 of the 14 subtests consist  of the subjects pointing to a choice of pictures, or indicating simply yes  or no.  <BR>
The authors intend the SSKAT to be used as a criterion test to ascertain  what an individual knows, believes, or does not know; and do not intend it  to be used as a norm-referenced test.  The SSKAT consists of realistic  pictures illustrating 14 relevant socio-sexual topics.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>TEACHING THE AUTISTIC SERIES</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Luce, Stephen C. and Walter P. Christian - editors</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This series is made up of the following eight texts:<BR>
Book 1: How to Integrate Autistic and Other Severely Handicapped    Children into a Classroom details specific procedures involved in    teaching all children to work independently and explains how to teach    autistic children to pay attention and not be distracted by extraneous    stimuli.<BR>
Book 2: How to Teach Sign Language to Developmentally Disabled    Children can be employed during the first one or two years of language    training to give handicapped, nonverbal children a basic communication    system.<BR>
Book 3: How to Treat Self-Injurious Behavior provides parents,    teachers, and therapists with a practical approach to treating    self-injurious behavior (e.g., head-banging, eye-poking, arm-biting).<BR>
Book 4: How to Teach Prevocational Skills to Severely Handicapped    Persons is an easy to follow guideline for identifying student needs,    specifying prevocational objectives, implementing effective training and    management strategies and evaluating the program's effectiveness.<BR>
Book 5: How to Teach Autistic and Other Severely Handicapped Children    provides procedures for effectively assessing and teaching autistic and    other severely handicapped children.<BR>
Book 6: How to Create a Curriculum for Autistic and Other Handicapped    Children addresses three areas of a curriculum that are central to a    systematic delivery of program services: design of the structure, format,    and content of the curriculum; procedures and processes necessary to    implement the curriculum; and  efficient, specific evaluation of the impact    of the curriculum.<BR>
Book 7: How to Reduce Autistic and Severely Maladaptive Behaviors    describes a number of strategies that are effective in reducing maladaptive    behavior while at the same time minimizing or preventing possible harmful    side effects of harsh punishment.<BR>
Book 8: How to Use Sensory Extinction describes a new nonaversive    treatment procedure that can be used by parents, teachers, therapists and    institutional staff to eliminate maladaptive behaviors in developmentally    delayed children.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL REVISED (DSM-IV)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>American Psychiatric Press</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>DSM-iv is the official A.P.A. diagnostic schema for use in classifying mental disorders. Categories no longer deemed useful have been deleted from the DSM-III-R and other's have been added. A new appendix provides information allowing translation of DSM numeric classifications to ICD classifications (where possible).<BR>
New Features include: Revised diagnostic criteria, greatly expanded section   on substance abuse, new classification and criteria for sleep disorders,    reorganization of the multiaxial system (axis I & II), refinement of axis    IV to be more clinically useful, revision of Axis V to include current    level of overall functioning, revised decision trees, etc.<BR>
NOTE: We suggest that first time purchasers buy the DSM-iv softcover (not just the desk reference) as the desk reference cannot be used with an    appropriate degree of accuracy in isolation from the complete text.<BR>

<BR>Disorders of Personality DSM-iv and beyond is a generally applicable text on  DSM-iv Axis II diagnoses. It is very useful as a guide to understanding  Dr. Millon's view of diagnosis and theory of personality as applied in the  Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-3 is listed separately in this  catalog). The text deals with a group of disorders that are difficult to diagnose because they are not always clearly distinct from normal functioning. In addition many contain overlapping traits. The author attmepts to clarify the distinction between personality and disorders in attempt to help the clinician make more accurate diagnoses.<BR>

<BR>Dr. Spanos is famous for his work debunking the claims of some practitioners of hypnosis. In this work he examines the connection between suggestibility and the Multiple Personality Phenomenon. He explains that MPD is a rare phonmenon outside the U.S. His research indicates that individuals diagnosed as multiples are extremely suggestible. He makes a strong case for a link between MPD and suggestibility.<BR>

<BR>This text facilitates a linking of current diagnostic theory of personality  disorders (DSM-III) with practical attempts to measure Axis I and Axis II  personality attributes. It is perhaps most useful as a beginner's book on  how to interpret test results from Millon's Clinical Multiaxial Inventory  (MCMI, listed separately in this catalog). For a more advanced, though more  difficult treatment of this subject by Dr. Millon, see his text Disorders of  Personality or the APA publication DSM-iv both listed in this catalog. <BR>

<BR>These forms are designed to give clients an idea of what can be expected from counselling. It is increasingly apparent that clients should be informed in advance of some of the psychologist's legal and ethical obligations and of the limits on confidentiality of information given to a counsellor in a session. From the psychologist's point of view, it may be necessary to have in the client's file some evidence of having passed this information on to the client before seeing him/her. <BR>
Forms come in packages of 100<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Monk, Gerald</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ (1996) is based on the theory that problems are manufactured in a social, cultural and political context. Each person produces the meaning of their own life -- meaning is not made for us. In the approach presented in this book, clients and therapists work together to unearth dormant competencies, talents and resources to create a positive "re-description" of the client. The author shows how narrative therapy can be applied to a wide variety of situations such as, the treatment of alcoholics, counselling students, working with indiginous populations, treating survivors of sexual abuse, and more.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Weitzenhoffer, A.M. and E.R. Hilgard</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This scale is a classic for teaching, research, and experimentation in  hypnosis. It provides a convenient objective measure of susceptibility and  contains verbatim instructions for the induction and testing of hypnotic  state using permissive, nonauthoritarian language and gentle challenges.  Scores are based on a 12-point scale. Forms A and B are equivalent and may  be used for test-retest studies. Form C contains more difficult items and  taps a greater variety of hypnotic experiences. It is recommended for  second testing and for the selection of subjects for more advanced hypnotic  research. There are other variations on this test by different authors  which may be used with children or which take less time to administer. <BR>
An optional profile scale is available. Both forms I and II of this scale  are required to yield a profile. The profile facilitates investigation of  special areas of susceptibility or insusceptibility of subjects in the  hypnotic state.<BR>

<BR>WET-STOP is a lightweight wearable alarm that teaches a child night-time  dryness. It uses a pyjama top buzzer and a moisture sensor which can be  placed in ordinary underwear. WET-STOP brings on dryness much faster than  waiting for the enuretic child to outgrow the problem. The  spontaneous cure rate in two trial samples of bed-wetting children  was about 14% per year in children between the ages of five and eleven. By  comparison 74% of all children using WET-STOP were dry within six months  and 76% in nine months.<BR>
Complete Kit includes: buzzer alarm, 4 washable flannel sensors, 4 velcro  shoulder strips, 2 sets of four batteries, 2 calendars with gold and silver  stars to mark child's progress, instructions for use.<BR>
Replace velcro strips and batteries with locally obtained materials.  Batteries are Eveready E41E 1.4v mercury hearing aid batteries or their  equivalent.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>BRACKEN BASIC CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Bracken, Bruce A.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The Bracken Concept Development Program is a comprehensive instructional   program for teaching basic concepts to children. The program follows a   multi-sensory approach that encourages  hands-on activities and   experiences.  When used in conjunction with the BBCS Screening Tests and   Diagnostic Scale, it provides a unified and complete program for the   assessment and  instruction of basic concepts.<BR>
The Bracken Basic Concept Scale is a comprehensive system of basic concept    assessment, consists of two instruments: a complete Diagnostic Scale that    measures 258 basic concepts and a set of short, easily administered    screening tests. The Diagnostic Scale is designed to be administered by    school psychologists, special education teachers, educational    diagnosticians, or speech-language clinicians. This takes 30 minutes. The    BBCS Screening Tests consists of two alternate, equivalent forms ( A or B).   These are quick, norm-referenced measures that help identify kindergarten    and first-grade students whose concept development is below age-level    expectations.<BR>
RANGE: 2.5 - 8 years old<BR>
Complete BCDP Kit includes Professional's Guide, 5 Posters, 40 Concept    Cards, and 154 worksheets in a canvas case.<BR>
Complete BBCS Kit includes Examiner's Manual, Diagnostic Scale Stimulus    Manual, 25 Diagnostic Record Forms, 1 Screening Test Form A and 1 Screening   Test Form B.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>CHILD DEVELOPMENT INVENTORIES</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Ireton, Harold</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>There are four inventories included under this title (formerly called the Minnesota Child Development Inventories)....<BR>
The Child Development Inventory (CDI, 15 months - 6 years)<BR>
The Child Development Review (CDR, 1 - 6 years)<BR>
Preschool Development Inventory (PDI, 3 - 6 years)<BR>
Early Child Development Inventory (ECDI, 15 months - 3years)<BR>
Infant Development Inventory (IDI, birth - 21 months)<BR>
The CDI is a 300 item true-false normed questionnaire for obtaining information from a child's parents or foster parents about the state of development of their child aged 1-6 years. A development profile and list of symptoms and behavior problems is obtained. Scales include Social Devlopment, Self Help, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Expressive Language, Language Comprehension, Letters and Numbers.<BR>
The Child Development Review (CDR) is for use with parents who may have trouble completing an inventory by themselves. It is described by Dr. Ireton as a "Parent-friendly", interview alternative, to the CDI questionnaire listed above.<BR>
ECDI & PDI provide screening-type information on the development of preschool children. They are comprised of a 60-item general development scale and a 24-item symptoms and behavior problem checklist. Age norms are provided. <BR>
IDI is a non-normed questionnaire to assist in determining the level of development of infants in their first 18 months. The question/Answer sheet is completed by a parent to describe the baby's development. It is designed to also be useful as a parent involvement/parent education tool. Items related to development milestones.<BR>

<BR>~ (1994), is a new developmental abilities rating scale for use in school settings.  Teachers fill out the questionnaire which is used to quantify knowledge of student abilities. The results can be used to facilitate communication with resource professionals or parents. CSSA is also a valuable method of screening large numbers of classes to identify students who are having difficulties in school. Nine areas of measurement include verbal thinking, speech, reading, writing, handwriting, math, science/social studies, motor and social behaviors.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>DEVELOPMENTAL TEST OF VISUAL MOTOR INTEGRATION (DVMI)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Beery, Keith</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The Beery-Buktenica (1996) Developmental test of Visual-Motor Integration long form consists of 24 increasingly difficult geometric forms which are copied with pencil on to paper. The DVMI measures the degree to which visual perception and motor behaviour are integrated. The test serves as a screening instrument for early identification of children with visual-motor difficulties.<BR>
The DVMI is recognized as a good survey test of visual motor integration. New to the 1996 revision are two supplementary tests (S. Visual Perception and S. Motor Coordination) that greatly enhance the tests ability to diagnose visual motor integration problems. The 1996 revision extends the range of the norms upward to include post high school age adults.<BR>
Although VMI was designed for use with kindergarten and first grade    students, it can be used with children as young as two years of age and has   also been used with adults. <BR>
A short form of this test (15 geometric figures) is available for use withchildren (aged 3-8 only). The short form is often used in kindergarten intake screening batteries.<BR>
RANGE: 3-adult<BR>
NEW EDITION DIFFERENCES: New norms for ages 3-adult, and 2 new supplementary tests.<BR>
UPGRADING: Order a manual and a pkg. of S. Visual and S. Motor tests. The old edition long form or short form booklets will still be usable as long as you have the new manual.<BR>

<BR>KDS is a curricular test for normal children through age nine, and    mentally retarded children of all ages. It consists of 270 behavioral    evaluation items representing maturity. The items can be used as teaching objectives. The KDS yields a Developmental Age (DA), Developmental Quotient (DQ), and individual construct ages and quotients for: Gross Motor; Fine Motor; Receptive; Expressive; Personal Behavior; and Interpersonal Behavior. These are further divided into: Infancy; Early Childhood; Early Adolescence, and Late Adolescence and Beyond.<BR>

<BR>KIPS measures early, high-level cognitive thinking, and indicates possible   need for intervention. All items are maturational prototypes which can be taught to enhance maturation. The scale is based on the  formulation that early high-level cognitive functioning can be assessed and stimulated   through tasks devoid of motor or self-help skills. KIPS  determines the   degree of high-level cognition in General Reasoning, Storage and Verbal   Communication. It then suggests activities and experience a  child needs   for effective adaptive functioning.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Bender, L.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The BVMGT is a diagnostic and/or experimental technique which shows the    maturation level of visual motor perception associated with various    functions of intelligence. Visual perception, motor coordination, memory,    temporal and spatial concepts, and organization or representation may be    assessed. The subject reproduces a set of designs, and his/her variations    from the originals are interpreted according to the gestalt laws of    perception and organization.<BR>
The Bender Cards are optionally available on a series of 9 (35mm) slides.<BR>
NOTE: Most uses of this test require materials which were developed after    the original work done by Dr. Bender, that we have listed separately as    Bender Gestalt Ancillaries<BR>

<BR>The BVMGT is a diagnostic and or experimental technique which shows the    maturation level of visual motor perception that is associated with various    functions of intelligence.<BR>
The test has a long history of use. Several authors have expanded on the    original test by Loretta Bender. Thus, in addition to the original    monograph and design cards...  users of the test with adults will want the    manual developed by Gerald Pascal and Barbara Suttell; users of the test    with children will want the manual developed by Elizabeth Koppitz.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Gardner, Morrison</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>TVMS-R gives a measurement of a child's eye-hand coordination - how a child  motorically translates with his hand what he or she visually perceives. The changes in the revised edition include: new geometric forms, deletion of some original geometric forms, revised norms and standardization, and revised method of scoring. The revised scoring is done by scoring a number of visual-motor characteristics for each design so that a subject's strengths and weaknesses can be determined in various areas of visual-motor functioning. There are nine scoring classifications: Line Quality, Closure, Angles, Intersecting Lines, Size, Rotation or Reversal, Length of Lines, Overpenetration, and Modification of Form. <BR>

<BR>~ (1986) provides the means to determine whether children have an expressive language problem as a result of word retrieval difficulties. Children's responses to naming tasks are measured formally in two dimensions: accuracy and item response time. TWF measures these skills through five sections of naming tasks: Picture Naming - Nouns, Picture Naming - Verbs, Sentence Completion Naming, Description Naming, and Picture Naming - Categories.<BR>
Complete Program includes easel-binder test book, administration,  interpretation, and scoring manual, technical manual containing in-depth  data on test development, norming, and technical characteristics, and 25  response booklets.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Dvorine, Israel</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>DCVT tests a subject's ability to discriminate between colors. A series of pseudoisochromatic plates each depict a circular mosaic of like colored dots. A numeral is set out within the mosaic in dots of a different color hue and the person is asked to identify the figure which is shown in the mosaic.<BR>
DCVT is approved for assessing color blindness where an isochromatic plate format is required -- as in testing the color vision of railwaymen and civil airmen as part of medical certification. It is simple to use and may be administered by office staff who have good color vision.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Individual, 10 minutes<BR>

<BR>Keystone Opthalmic Telebinocular is one of the best means of screening for visual impairment. These products are designed to aid in the testing of visual skills, the diagnosis of visual problems, and the correction of visual disorders.<BR>
For Child Development and Educational uses we suggest the DVSii Vision   Screening Telebinocular, the Visual Skills Test Set with Visual Skills test   record forms. For screening with young children, possilby the Peek-a-Boo   test set and Peek-a-Boo record forms may be of use.<BR>
For general vision fitness as part of a pre-employment assessment, we recommend the Industrial Screening test set. This is an 15 target set used to evaluate overall visual fitness. Tests include Stereopsis, color discrimination, distance usable vision, near point usable vision, vertical phoria, lateral phoria, and fusion. Form number 5545 should be used for this test. If you are specifcally interested in candidates' ability to see very fine wires or very fine printing on electrical components used in circuit board assembly, we recommend the Near Point Snellen Acuity test.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>COGNITIVE DIAGNOSTIC BATTERY (CDB)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Kay, Stanley R.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>CDB assesses cognitive variables of primary importance in psychiatric and    retarded populations. The test was developed to evaluate the nature and    degree of intellectual disorders and to aid in differential diagnosis of    mental retardation versus psychosis. Using a Piagetian framework, CDB also    serves to distinguish between deficits related to impaired development    versus later regression. It is especially useful with intellectually    limited, nonverbal, inattentive or overtly psychotic patients who may be    unassessable by other means.<BR>
The CDB focuses on the qualitative deficits and abnormal processes that are    of primary concern in a clinical setting. Research on the test shows that    it may be used with success in differentiating between schizophrenia,    retarded psychotics, normal adults, the elderly and children.<BR>
Kit includes: all 5 tests, test manual and 50 of each scoring form<BR>

<CENTER><H2>COMPREHENSIVE TEST OF NONVERBAL INTELLIGENCE</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Hammill, Don; Nils Pearson & J. Lee Wiederholt</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ (1995, 1997) This test was first released in 1995. Due to the lack of recent efforts to produce multidimesional non-verbal IQ materials this publication was greeted with enthusiasm. The major criticism of the initial release was that norms were only collected on school-ages. This problem has now been remedied, as adult norms have now been released. The test has been designed to be as unbiased as possible toward language and other environmental factors which contribute to most IQ scores. The 6 subtests are Pictorial Analogies, Geometric Analogies, Pictorial Categories, Geometric Categories, Pictorial Sequences, and Geometric Sequences. Examinees can respond by pointing to the correct response if necessary.<BR>
CTONI provides a generalized pictorial vs. geometric difference score for the complete test (Nonverbal IQ), as well as for Sequences, Analogies and Categories separately. In addition, Pictorial and Geometric IQ are provided.<BR>
NORMS: based on more than 2,000 students from 22 different states, plus Canada and Panama -- aged 7-17, New adult norms are available as of Spring 1997.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Individual, 1 hour for all 6 subtests<BR>
NOTE: a new manual is in production that will provide revised norms and will extend the use of this test to adult ages.<BR>

<BR>CFIT were developed to yield a measure of general intelligence. Test scores are relatively free from educational  and cultural influences and are useful where environmental factors may influence conventional test scores. Scale 1 consists of eight subtests, is not as free of cultural bias as the other scales and must be, in part, administered individually. Scale 2 and 3 consist of four subtests, all of which are perceptual and non-verbal in nature. Scale 2 & 3 are group administered, and each have 2 equivalent forms A and B.<BR>
RANGE: Scale 1: ages 4-8 and older learning disabled, Scale 2: ages 8-14   and average adults, and Scale 3: ages 14 - college and adults<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Stone, Mark H. and Benjamin D. Wright</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>Knox's Cube Test (KCT) is a non-verbal mental test which measures the attention span and short-term memory of children and adults. <BR>
Because attention span and short-term memory are basic to acquiring almost all other skills, the KCT is useful in a wide variety of psychological and educational evaluations. The manual provides procedures and a rationale for administering, scoring and interpreting a comprehensive version of Knox's Cube Test which incorporates previous versions. Directions for the KCT are few, and pantomime can be used for test administration. This makes the KCT useful in evaluating the mental status of the deaf, non-verbal and foreign speaking. This revision of Knox's Cube Test utilizes Rasch measurement procedures to develop an objective psychometric variable, along which both items and persons can be positioned.<BR>

<BR>This test presents cognitive tasks that assess verbal and non-verbal    capacity, it provides a measure of school learning ability.  Eight    subtests are utilized at each of the seven test levels.  Four of the    subtests use item types that are primarily non-verbal in nature. Items   are based more upon an understanding of numbers and figures than upon    vocabulary and reading skill.  The other four subtests at each level are    more dependent upon verbal skills.<BR>
Various forms are available for use with different grade levels. K -    kindergarten, A - grade 1, BC - grades 2-3, CD - grades 3-4, EF - grades    5-6, G - grades 7-9, H - grades 9-12.<BR>

<BR>The Advanced Progressive Matrices are a nonverbal measure of G, intended to  be used with persons of above average ability. There are two sets of  matrices. Set 1 is a quick screening test which is used to confirm that use  of the Advanced form is warranted. A timed administration of Set 2 yields a  good measure of intellectual capacity. <BR>
RANGE: 11 years and older.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Set 1, 10 minutes, Set 2, 40 minutes or untimed.<BR>
Specimen Set: includes one of each test booklts, sections 1 and 4 of  the manual, 12 answer forms. Does not include key.<BR>

<BR>Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices are a non verbal measure of  intellectual capacity. They are used with children, or low functioning  adults whose test results are to be compared with norms for a child  population. The Crichton Vocabulary scale which is included with the latest  printing of the Colored Progressive Matrices provides a verbal assessment  component so that together, the two measures are a quick measure of I.Q.<BR>
RANGE: 6 years or older, and elderly or mentally retarded people<BR>

<BR>The Comprehensive Manual to Raven's Matrices is comprised of several    sections which describe 1) use of the various parts of the Matrices, 2) the   accompanying vocabulary tests and 3) research summary. <BR>
Confusion sometimes occurs because specimen sets may contain up to 3    sections of the manual, resulting in the user getting duplicate copies of    certain sections. Also, the research supplements which are not included    with specimen sets must be purchased separately from the list of sections    below if they are required. <BR>
NOTE: To use a given level of the test the user must have the GENERAL    OVERVIEW (Section 1), and the section(s) of the manual which pertain(s) to    the particular form of the test being used. For example, to use the    Coloured Matrices you would need sections 1 & 2.<BR>
Research Supplement #1 (1972) Describes the standardization of the Standard   Matrices and the Mill-Hill Vocabulary Scale<BR>
Research Supplement #2 (1982) is a Research Update (NOT AVAILABLE   SEPARATELY -- NOW INCLUDED IN Resarch Supplement 4).<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Swanson, H. Lee</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>SCPT is an intelligence test battery of 11 subtests that measure different aspects of cognitive abilities related to information processing potential. A brief form (5 of the subtests) can be administered. It is ideal for psychologists who want to assess congnitive ability inexpensively, or for learning assistance teachers who want to obtain ability information for psychoeducational assessments.<BR>
Subtests include: <BR>
Rhyming Words (primary ability measured is immediate auditory recall)<BR>
Visual Matrix (recalling the position of dots in a matrix: primary ability measured is nonverbal memory span)<BR>
Auditory Digit Sequencing (remembering the numbers of and address: primary ability is sequencing of numbers within a sentence context)<BR>
Mapping and Directions (recalling the direction to get out of a city: primary ability measured is nonverbal sequencing)<BR>
Story Retelling (primary ability is sequentially remembering key words related to episodes in a story)<BR>
Picture Sequencing (remembering the sequence of cards with symbols: primary ability is memory of symbols and their position on a card)<BR>
Phrase Recall (remembering unrelated phrases in order: primary ability is making mental association between unrelated phrases in order to recall them in order)<BR>
Spatial Organization (remembering an organized sequence of symbols)<BR>
Semantic Association (requires the ability to organize information into categories and to remember items within the categories)<BR>
Nonverbal Sequencing (requires the examinee to form an association between symbols and then to use the association to remember and locate symbols in position)<BR>

<BR>TCSM is designed to identify the student's cognitive learning style and  hemispheric specialization.  Each hemisphere is associated with certain  learning traits.  Students who process information in the left hemisphere  are logical, systematic, linear and prefer to use pencil and paper. This is<BR>
the "inchworm style".  Students who process information in the right  hemisphere are intuitive, holistic, simulataneous, and prefer to solve  problems mentally.  This is the "grass-hopper style".  The TCSM is based  upon materials and problems which are familiar to classroom teachers.   Detailed explanations are provided throughout the manual.<BR>

<BR>The Wechsler scales are probably the most widely used battery for testing cognitive ability. Separate verbal and performance quotient scores are obtained, as well as a composite IQ score. The current revision of the test consists of 5 verbal subtests and 5 performance subtests. Optionally the symbol search digit span and maze subtests may be administered to provide information about visual-percetpual skills and short term memory. For more information on this test see the WISC-3 companion text by Steve Truch listed separately in this catalog.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 50-70 min.<BR>
RANGE: 6-16.11 years<BR>
Complete kit includes: manual, stimulus booklet, 25 record forms, object assembley puzzles, layout shield, block design cues, picture arrangement cards, two mazes response booklets, two symbol search response booklets, coding/symbol search scoring template.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>WOODCOCK JOHNSON REVISED (WJ-R) (1989)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Woodcock, Richard and Mary Bonner Johnson</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This complete revision of the original WJ offers comprehensive individual  assessment of both Achievement and Ability. Broad areas measured in the achievement area include Reading, Math, Written Language and Knowledge. Three new tests have been added to the Written Language cluster, making it a good measure of writing. <BR>
New norms were based on over 6,200 subjects.<BR>
The Cognitive battery was greatly expanded in this revision. It measures 7 different factors: Longterm memory, shortterm memory, processing speed, auditory processing, visual processing, comprehension-knowledge and fluid reasoning. The Cognitive battery is based on the Horn-Cattell model of intellectual processing, an extension of the Gf-Gc theory (fluid and crystalized thinking). <BR>
A standard Cognitive battery and/or a more comprehensive supplementary cognitive battery are available.<BR>
Each battery comes with test book, examiner's manual and norm tables, audio cassette, and 25 test records.<BR>
The achievement battery comes in two equivalent forms. However, Canadian  replacement pages are only available for form A. Form B is little used in  Canada.<BR>
SOFTWARE: The W-J-Writer scoring software is definitely recommended. Hand scoring this test is inconvenient because there are many separate tables in which to look up information. The software does all the lookup work and produces the "boiler plate" for a psychoeducational assessment report. All that remains for the psychologist is to "edit in" information from observations, personal interpretation and supplementary tests administered, and to "edit out" any information that doesn't apply. <BR>
RANGE: 2 - 90 years<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Individual, approximately 40 minutes each for the Standard  Cognitive and Achievement batteries.<BR>
NOTE: Part four of the original WJ (Scales of Independent Behaviour) was not  included in the revision and is now sold separately.<BR>
NEW: The Report Writer scores and reports the WJ-R in a manner suitable for use as an aid in writing up psychoeducational assessments. Like the Compuscore, the software is licensed for an unlimited number of uses on a single machine. Orders of 5 or more Compuscores or Report Writers will receive a 10% discount.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>BRIGANCE IEP FORMS OR SOFTWARE VERSION (MICROSOFT WORD)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Brigance, Albert H.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The paper and pencil version of the IEP system includes the most commonly used instructional goals and objectives of the Brigance Inventories (CIBS-Green, IBS-Blue, IES-Red). The forms are for people who don't have a word processor that can read Microsoft Word Format Documents. Separate forms are avilable to formulate IEP's in the areas of Readiness, Reading, Math, Writing & Spelling, and Individual Uses -- for each of the three Brigance inventories listed above. There are four separate forms that correspond to each of the three Brigance Tests listed, making a total of 12 forms available in all.<BR>
If you have Microsoft WORD for Windows or MACWORD, you don't need to buy the IEP forms -- just buy the appropriate diskette and make your own IEP forms as WORD documents. This allows one to store student IEP data as a WORD document, update objectives, edit the IEP, make an IEP of whatever length you like, etc. The Objectives are simply imported from the objective file which is shipped to you in WORD format.<BR>

<CENTER><EM></EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>Used to assess the achievement level of adults with varying amounts of   schooling, the CAAT covers basic skills in a non-threatening format. <BR>
The Select-a-Level determines which level to use on the individual.<BR>
To assess the ability of an individual to perform academicly at the grade 12 level, we strongly recommend that level D be used. Level C does not contain enough difficult items to adequately assess whether or not academic skills are sufficient to allow the individual to do academic work presented in high school. To assess the ability of an adult to do high school level academic tasks, administer level D of this test.  <BR>
Level A - 1-4 yrs schooling<BR>
Level B - 5-8 yrs schooling<BR>
Level C - 8-12 yrs schooling<BR>
Level D - 11-1st yr College/University<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Group, approximately 2 hours<BR>

<CENTER><H2>CANADIAN TEST OF BASIC SKILLS</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM></EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>CTBS is a comprehensive academic achievement battery. It measures a range of school skills for students in grades K-12. 69 major skill areas are assessed using items that tap 248 skill objectives. CTBS is a Canadian revision of the U.S. published Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS).<BR>
At the primary level, test booklets are consumable (children respond in the booklets), and separate keys for each booklet are provided. At the higher levels, a single multilevel test booklet is purchased with the appropriate answer sheet and scoring key sold separately for each level of the test. The appropriate range of subtests to be administered can be determined from the Manual.<BR>
For grades 3-8 (Multilevel edition), two alternate equivalent forms of the test are available (forms 7 & 8). The two equivalent forms facilitate pre and post testing.<BR>
Wherever overlaping age or grade ranges exist in the table below, one should try to administer the highest appropriate level of the test -- unless learning delay precludes a measurable amount of success at that level. For administration purposes the test is divided into levels...<BR>

<CENTER><EM></EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>DRP is a good measure of functional literacy.  It has a wide range of applications in assessing the level at which individuals or groups read.  The test is ideally suited for school assessment of functional reading level at all grades. The Advanced forms and the more difficult levels of the Standard forms are useful in pre-employment testing. DRP measures reading as a "whole skill" using a modified cloze format (the examinee selects the word which best fills in a blank in a sentence from a set of five choices). DRP  is unlike most norm referenced tests which examine specific subskill components of reading ability and then generalize that the subskills will be an accurate representation of "overall reading ability".<BR>
The new 1994 revision of DRP includes two alternate equivalent forms (for test-retest). For students in grade 4 and older, DRP tests consist of 70 item, modified cloze, reading passages.<BR>
New for 1995 are two Advanced levels of DRP which consist of a 20 item short form of the tests. These forms are designated T&U. The reading passages for these forms are more difficult than the wider-range, longer, tests (standard forms G & H). Actual test length and appropriate age levels are listed in the table below. Advanced DRP (1995) focuses on how well students are able to reason with prose.<BR>
Primary test booklets are consumed -- there are no answer sheets for these forms. Standard and Advanced test booklets are reusable, and require separate answer sheets.<BR>
Classroom sets contain all the materials needed to administer and interpret DRP for up to 30 students.  Scoring keys must be purchased separately.<BR>
We recommend the exam kits for evaluating test content. Each kit includes one copy of the test forms, practice exercises, and a manual. These kits are non-returnable.   <BR>

<BR>DTLA-3 (1991) is used to isolate special intra-individual strengths and    weaknesses.  It is designed to identify students deficient in general or    specific aptitudes.  Eleven subtests plus 16 composites measure general    intelligence aptitude and discrete ability areas.  <BR>
Subtests: Word Opposites (vocabulary), Design Sequences (visual    discrimination and memory), Sentence Imitation (grammar), Reversed Letters    (order recall, auditory), Story Construction (storytelling), Design    Reproduction (drawing from memory), Basic Information (everyday fact    knowledge), Symbolic Relations (reasoning, visual), Word Sequences    (repeating words), Story Sequences (organizing meaningful segments),    Picture Fragments (gestalt-closure function).<BR>
COMPLETE KIT: includes examiner's manual, picture book, story construction, design reporduction, symbolic relations, picture book for story sequences, 25 profile forms, 25 examiner booklets, 25 response forms, flipbook and chips, and design cubes, in a storage box.<BR>
IBM-PC Computer scoring disk (not included in kit) allows unlimited uses, and provides standard scores, percentile ranks and age equivalents for the basic scales as well as composite scores and calculation of the significance of intra-ability differences. A multi-page text report is also provided.<BR>
The subtests are easily assigned to composites that are similar to major theoretical constructs such as Horn's fluid and crytalized inteligence, Jensen's associative and cognitive levels, Das's simulatneous and successive processes, and Wechsler's verbal-performance model. <BR>

<CENTER><EM>Scholastic Testing Service</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ is a comprehensive placement test for 8th grade students. It provides a great deal of academic information in a single morning of testing. The basic battery provides information about student placement in MAth Reading and Language. Three optional tests can be used to provide information about student knowledge of Science, Mechanical Aptitude, or Catholic Religion.<BR>
Cognitive Skill Quotient (CSQ) scores, Local and National (U.S.) Percentiles and grade equivalents (U.S.) are provided with machine scoring. Hand scoring is achieved using the tables provided in the hand scoring Manual. The Rasch item response theory one parameter model was used to develop the standard score scale so HSPT results will be comparable from year to year.<BR>
Practice tests may be used to familiarize students with the type of items used and with responding.<BR>

<BR>~ (1990) is a computer assisted measurement program that monitors basic skills progress in three academic areas -- Basic Reading, Basic Math and Basic Spelling.<BR>
Reading software measures students reading ability uses a multiple choice cloze format test that is presented on screen. Math software uses two alternate equivalent tests consisting of problem types taught thoughout the school year. Spelling tests student's proficiency by having them enter words at the computer keyboard. All the spelling words are expected to be found in the curriculum. <BR>

<CENTER><H2>NELSON-DENNY READING TEST (1993)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM></EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ is a widely used group administerable reading survey test. A short form may be used (called cut-time administration) which reduces that vocabulary items to 80 from 100 and eliminates one reading passage in the comprehension test. A long form (called extended-time administration) may be used to meet the needs of ESL populations, or slower adults. The test booklets themselves are produced in two alternate equivalent forms (G & H) for test-retest situations. Scoring information on the extended-time administration is contained in the Technical Report rather than in the Manual. The test booklets are reusable. Separate self-scoring answer sheets are required. No scoring stencils are needed.<BR>
The test was revised in 1993 (forms G & H were produced). The previous edition of the test (older forms E & F) are still available. They are MORE EXPENSIVE than the current edition (no one can explain why).<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Form E or F 35 minutes<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: Form G or H Standard 35 minutes, Cut-time 20 minutes, extended time 56 minutes.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>NEW GAP TEST</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>McLeod, John & Rita McLeod</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The GAP test uses a cloze technique to measure reading    comprehension. The examninee is asked to select the right word to complete   a sentence with a blank space in it. This technique is perhaps the best single variable method for assessing Reading as a "whole skill". Some reading specialists feel that this is preferable to generalizing a "general reading ability score" from the individual's performance on several tests that measure understanding of graphemes/phonemes, vocabulary, etc.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Slingerland, Beth H.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>These tests will screen a group of children to identify those who show   indications of having a specific language disability (SLD) in reading,   handwriting,  spelling, or speaking.  The tests, designed for grades 1-6,   may be used for individual testing as well as group testing.  Subtests 1-5   evaluate visual-motor coordination, visual memory, visual discrimination,   and visual memory  linked with motor coordination.  Subtests 6-8 evaluate   auditory-visual  discrimination and auditory memory-to-motor ability.  Form   D contains a  ninth subtest for evaluating personal orientation in time and   space as well  as the ability to express ideas in writing.  All forms also   contain  individual auditory tests to identify those who are unable to   recall or  pronounce words correctly or are unable to express organized   thoughts in  either spoken or written language.<BR>
RANGE: Screening Test, Form A is for grade 1 - beginning Grade 2, Form B is   for grade 2 - beginning grade 3, Form C is for Grades 3-4, and Form D is    for Grades 5-6.<BR>
Teacher's Manual, Form A,B,C, includes directions for test administration    scoring and evaluation (172 pages)<BR>
The college version helps identify strengths and difficulties students may encounter in future academia.  The high school version is for identifying specific language disabilities in students grades 9-12.<BR>

<BR>SDMT measures students' acquisition of basic math concepts and skills. The test is intended for use before empbarking on a course of instruction in order to identify those students who will be extrememly challenged, and who may require extra assistace in order to keep up. The majority of SDMT items are at an easy level, in order to obtain as good a measure as possible of areas of weakness (and of relative strength) in students who are having difficulty with basic math instruction.<BR>

<BR>SDRT provides information useful in planning instruction for students who may be having difficulty in reading. The majority of test items are at an easy level to facilitate identification of weaknesses and areas of relative strength for such students. It is particularly useful with ESL students.<BR>
Two new levels have been added to the test in order to afford better coverage. The six levels are as follows...<BR>
LEVEL      GRADE<BR>
Red       1.5-2.5<BR>

<CENTER><H2>TEST OF ADOLESCENT AND ADULT LANGUAGE: THIRD EDITION</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Hammill, Donald et al</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ (1994), yields composite scores in ten areas: listening, speaking, reading, writing, spoken language, written language, vocabulary, grammar, receptive language, and expressive language. The new revisions allow the extension of the norms to include 18 through 24 year old persons enrolled in post-secondary education programs.<BR>
Kit includes: Manual, 50 answer booklets, 10 question books, and 50 summary/profile  forms.<BR>
Software scoring system is designed for use with an IBM computer  and an 80 column printer. MAC users need Emulator software (listed separately in this catalog or available from any computer store) to run this software. The software converts subtest raw scores to standard scores and percentiles, generates composite scores, profiles composite scores, and compares composite performance for intraindividual differences.  It provides a printout suitable for inclusion in the student's permanent file.<BR>

<BR>~ is a test of silent reading comprehension. Its four subtests are: (1) General Vocabulary: the ability to identify words that are related to a common concept; (2) Syntactic Similarities: the understanding of meaningfully similar but syntactically different sentences; (3) Paragraph Reading: the ability to answer questions related to paragraphs; (4) Sentence Sequencing: the ability to build plausible relationships among sentences, both to each other and to a reader-created whole. There are also four supplementary subtests, three which measure students' abilities in reading the vocabularies of math, science, and social studies. For younger and remedial students, Subtest 8, Reading the Directions of Schoolwork, is a valuable diagnostic tool.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>WECHSLER INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT TEST (WIAT)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM></EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This test is and individually administered comprehensive achievement battery  co-normed with WISC-III. The WIAT contains 8 subtests: basic,  reading,   mathematics reasoning, spelling, reading comprehension, numerical operations, listening comprehension, oral expression, and written expression. The three subtests in Stimulus booklet 1 can be administered as a screener of academic skills.  This can be purchased separately if only a brief evaluation of achievement is required. We understand that a 2nd edition of this test will likely be released in 1998. <BR>
ADMINISTRATION: screener 15-20 minutes / complete test 60-75 minutes<BR>
SCREENER: includes manual, stimulus booklet 1 and 25 screener record forms<BR>
COMPLETE KIT: includes manual, stimulus booklets 1 & 2, 25 record forms, 25   response booklets, and 5 screener record forms.<BR>
SCORING DISKETTEs provide an unlimited number of uses for the WIAT and the WISC-3 together OR separately. If both tests are administered an accurate achievement ability comparison is generated. We recommend the narrative WISC-3 writer.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>WIDE RANGE ACHIEVEMENT TEST - 3 (WRAT-3 1994)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Wilkinson, Gary</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>The WRAT-3 quickly provides information on the examinees level of skill in   Arithmentic, Reading and Spelling. This revsion of the test features two alternate equivalent forms and a profile analysis form.<BR>
Three subtests are included. The reading test is a pronunciation test that presents the examinee with printed english words and asks him to read them aloud. In the spelling test the examiner reads a series of words and asks the examinee to write the correct spellings. Reading ability is generalized from the subject's ability to pronounce and to spell the words in the test. The arithmetic test is highly speeded series of progressively more difficult questions. The number of correct answers is tallied to score the test. Virtually nobody is able to complete the arithmetic test in the time given. In all three tests, the "wide range" format involves administration of a steeply graded series of items on which all examinees are expected to demonstrate a measurable amount of success (and failure). <BR>
RANGE: 5 - 75 years<BR>
WRAT-3 Set: Manual, 25 Blue and 25 Tan Test Forms, 25 profile/analysis forms, Plastic Administration Cards.<BR>
NOTE: if an alternate form is not required, users may find purchasing either one of the packages of tests, a manual, and the platic cards to be cheaper. <BR>

PVT identifies the individual's level of expressive language development and can be used as an estimate of verbal aptitude.<BR>
PVS is group administered in 10 minutes<BR>
PVT consists of 165 pictures on stimulus cards and may be individually  administered in 15 minutes. <BR>

<CENTER><EM>Wallace, G. & Don Hammill</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ (1994) is a refreshing change from blackline drawing-type picture vocab. tests. This test uses full color photo's as stimuli. It is intended to be used in identification of students who need help with oral vocabulary. Receptive and expressive oral vocabulary strengths and weaknessess are identified. The format for the test is "point-to-picture". Speaking or writing are not pre-requisite. There are 10 plates with familiar themes. A group of words are associated with each theme, and the student picks the pictures that go with the words. The CREVT is easy to score, items are unbiased, and tests are easy and quick to administer. Forms A and B are alternate equivalent forms for test-retest<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Gardner, Morrison F. (expressive 1990,receptive 1985)</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>EOWVPT-R and ROWPVT measure expressive and receptive language skills respectively. Pictorial test items identify the extent to which the student can name a pictured object or can identify a picture which  corresponds to a word the examiner speaks. Language Age scores, percentile norms and Expressive versus Receptive Language ability difference information is provided. <BR>
EOWPVT-R is a picture vocabulary test used to assess a child's speaking vocabulary. It can be used as a screen for possible speech defects or learning disorders, to estimate a bilingual student's fluency in English, or to determine school readiness or placement.<BR>
ROWPVT presents a set of picture responses and asks the student to indicate the picture that corresponds to the word spoken by the examiner.<BR>
The Upper Extension kits parallel the regular editions but are for use    with older students.<BR>
RANGE: Regular edition 2-12 years; Upper extension 12-16 years<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: individual, 20 minutes per form<BR>

<BR>The PPVT-R measures an individual's receptive (hearing) vocabulary for  Standard American English and provides, at the same time, a quick estimate  of verbal ability or scholastic aptitude. Results are most commonly reported as a "Language Age" score. This test has two parallel forms:  Form L and Form M and also has a regular edition or special edition. The special edition has a light press varnish on pages to protect them a little bit.<BR>
The Kits include 175 test plates, manual and 25 of each of the test records specified. The French version is essentially the same:  form A and B are alternate equivalent to form L and M.<BR>
RANGE: 2.5 years - adult<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 20 minutes<BR>
REVISION: This test is being revised currently and a new edition will probably be released in late March 1997.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>McCarr, Dorothy</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This program is designed to build basic practical vocabulary. It consists of a series of workbooks (book A -- Book G, 100 pp. paperback 8.5"x11" format). Reading level of grade 2-3 is required, although the vocabulary words are of a higher level. The 21,000 vocabulary words have been chosen from magazines and newpapers accessible to most students. <BR>
Each workbook contains 15 lessons of 6 exercises each. Included are: New Words (the student names words and reads definition), scrambled words (unscrambles letters and matches definitions to words), dictionary use (places words into alphabetical order and devides into syllables, missing words (selects words to complete sentences), scrambled sentences (correctly orders words) and creating sentences (fixes tenses and selects).<BR>

<BR>LAAP is a useful tool for analyzing four areas of language arts:  reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  It utilizes the student's own L.A. materials-their books, their writing, their oral reports-in order to evaluate skills/do own trouble-shooting.  The portfolio documents growth throughout the school year, and thus is useful for discussions with the student and parents. <BR>
Each kit includes a teacher's guide, blackline masters, set of 30 evaluation booklets, set of 30 portfolios, and an individual student summary.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Foster, R., J. Giddan and J. Stark</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>ACLC (1983) identifies receptive language difficulties in young children and  indicates guidelines for correction of language disorders. The test uses a  core vocabulary of 50 common words combined into two, three, and four  element phrases. No oral responses are required. The child points to an  appropriate picture in response to a word or phrase from the examiner. <BR>
The ACLC Manual (1983) contains helpful discussions of language impairment  as well as guidelines for language training.  The ACLC is essentially a  criterion-referenced instrument, although the Manual does provide mean  scores for 6-month age groups from 3 years to 6 years 5 months.  A brief  screening version is also identified in this new manual.<BR>

<BR>CELF-3 is a 1995 revision of the widely used CELF-R. It is a comprehensive  diagnostic tool to measure the language skills of learning-disabled students in the areas of semantics, syntax, and memory.<BR>
Subtests include: Sentence Structure (Receptive), Word Structure (Expressive), Concepts and Directions (Receptive), Formulated Sentences (Expressive), Sentence Assembly (Expressive), Semantic Relationships (Receptive), Recalling Sentences (Expressive), Word Classes (Receptive), Word Associations (Expressive), Listening to Paragraphs (Receptive), Rapid Automatic Naming (Expressive). The whole battery need not be administered to obtain a norm referenced language score. Three subtests can be administered to obtain an Expressive Language score, and 3 subtests can be administered to obtain an expressive language score. The total language composite will be otained from the scores on the 3 expressive and 3 receptive subtests (6 are required in all). The six subtests which are best used for each age range of students are identified in the manual. Thre supplementary subtests: Word Association, Listening to Paragraphs, and Rapid Automatic Naming are provided only for use in obtaining supplementary diagnostic information, and are not used to obtain the expressive/receptive and total battery scores.<BR>
Scores Provided: Subtest Standard Scores and Percentile Ranks; Receptive and Expressive Language Scores with both Standard Scores and Percentile Ranks; Total Language Standard Score as a Percentile Rank and Age Equivalent.<BR>
Computer Scoring Available: Narrative report (IBM).<BR>
RANGE: K - 21 years<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: individual, 30-45 minutes depending on client.<BR>
Complete Battery includes 2 Stimulus Manuals, Examiner's Manual, Technical  Manual, and 12 Record Forms.<BR>
NOTE: Limited budget purchasers can save nearly half the price of the kit by ordering parts 4500, 4502, & 9619 only.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Goldman, Ronald and Macalyne Fristoe</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This test systematically measures a child's articulation of consonant  sounds.  The sounds-in-words subtest uses 35 pictures to elicit  articulation of the major speech sounds in the initial, medial and final  positions.  The sounds-in-sentences subtest assesses spontaneous sound  production used in connected speech.  The stimulability subtest yields the  child's ability to produce correctly a previously misarticulated sound when  asked to watch and listen to the examiner's production of the sound.  No  reading is required by the child. <BR>

<BR>NSST is an good screening instrument for speech specialists who need a    short test for large numbers of children, or for diagnosticians who need to   make a quick estimate of syntactic development as a part of a more    elaborate speech and hearing evaluation. It will isolate those children<BR>
who are sufficiently deviant in syntactic development to warrant further   study, as well as determine which children will benefit from a remedial    language program. Use of the NSST measures both receptive and expressive   use of syntactic forms, using identical linguistic structures on both parts   of the test.<BR>

<BR>This manual presents an innovative, theory-based diagnostic tool for  assessing speech articulation. Instead of assessing specific articulation  errors, as is done with traditional methods, this procedure determines the  individual's phonological patterns by analyzing processes such as syllable  structure, harmony, and feature contrasts. Speech is elicited through  entertaining drawings contained in the manual. Reproducible record forms  are also provided in the manual.<BR>

<BR>TLC measures metalinguistic skills in semantics, syntax and pragmatics. This extension of the TLC covers a broad age range with age appropriate items, provides norms, and helps determine the need for intervention. A quick screening composite score (based on two of the subtests) will quickly determine if further testing is necessary. Memory strategies are measured with a separate subtest. The manual provides teaching strategies to follow up for specific subtests (aids IEP development).<BR>
NOTE: If you already have the TLC first edition you can upgrade to the expanded edition by purchasing the upgrade kit.<BR>
NOTE: The text Steps to Language Competence - Developing Metalinguistic Strategies is a valuable resource for anyone working with language-disordered people. Training models methods and sample activities are provided. This text by E. Wiig, is not included in the kit, but is recommended.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>DEMENTIA SCALE FOR DOWN SYNDROME (1995)</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Gedye, Angela</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ is an informant based instrument for use by psychologists in assessing the presence or absence of dementia in adults with Down syndrome. It has also been effective in assessing dementia in developmentally disabled (MR) adults without Down syndrome. DSDS was designed so that persons in the severe and profound ranges can be assessed. The technique was standardized on 70 DS adults and 37 non-DS adults who were followed as part of a seven year longitudinal study in BC, Canada. A concurrent validity (kappa=.81) and reliability study (inter-rater reliability kappa=.91), was done with 50 DS adults in Ontario, Canada.<BR>
DSDS reliably distinguishes between lifelong impairments and features that represent progressive cognitive deterioration. Scoring crieteria reflect severity of dementia in early middle or late stages. The author contends that younger DS adults may develop a dememtia which is symptomatically identical to Alzheimers disease. However, the early onset dementia is potentially reversible.

<BR>This articulation/speech therapy program presents a systematic method for  correcting the articulation of eight target sounds: k , l, f, s, r, sh, ch,  and th.  The stimuli for the target sounds are shifted from one phonetic  environment to another so that the student encounters them in various  positions: at the beginning, middle, and end of words, at different  locations within words, and in sound-loaded sentences.<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Lowe, R., & Mount Weitz, J.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>These activities emphasize the communicative function of speech while addressing phonological disorders. There are guidelines included for the development of language-based activities for the treatment of phonological disorders. The three major areas addressed are: minimal and maximal pairs, individual target sounds in activities that emphasize the communicative function of speech, and transfer of skills to outside activities.<BR>
There are over 50 activities.<BR>
Picture Resources are used with the activities. Over 300 black line drawings, which can be reproduced on your photocopier, focus on a variety of phonological and articulation targets. They can be used with any activity oriented to the remediation of articulation and phonological disorders.<BR>
RANGE:  Ages 3-8<BR>

<BR>BSRI measures masculinity and femininity separately, and is based on the author's theory of psychological androgyny, i.e. that people can possess both masculine and feminine characteristics. This theory is in contrast to that of more widely used scales which measure masculinity-femininity as opposite ends of a single bipolar scale.<BR>
The Inventory consists of 20 each of feminine and masculine personality  characteristics and 20 neutral items.  Items are so arranged that a Short  Form with good reliability can be obtained by administering only the first  30 items.  Each item is rated on a 7-point scale in terms of how  descriptive it is of the subject.<BR>

It makes the case that abuse demonstrates a lack of consideration for the rights of those family members and community members vicitmized by the client's behaviors. The authors postulate that learning and practicing empathy is one of the hardest tasks facing abusive clients. Clients are taught that empathy is a sign of strength -- not weakness, and that practicing empathy will lead to a fuller and more rewarding lives. <BR>
